Although not very religious myself my wife and I experienced a service with choir that blew us away. If you get the chance sit and listen the sound gives the feel you witness from the TV ie weddings etc only Dre back we missed the time slot for viewing the inside all over. One to return to me thinks!,"July 21, 2019"
"Your contribution is gbp20.00 for entry, try and go early before too many people come or go to a service.","July 21, 2019"
I didn’t see this place Included on any “London attraction” tours and it’s totally worth stopping by. It’s pricy to get in but you will be allowed in for free if you are praying. Please don’t scam the system and pay if you want to tourist because it goes back to the this church and restoration efforts. It’s amazing,"July 21, 2019"
Beautiful cathedral. Our tour guide gave us a virtual type tour before we went in so we had an idea of the history. A must see in you're in the area.,"July 20, 2019"
"My son and I visited this Cathedral, it was Magnificent. On the London Pass. Rivals Italy. My only issue is no photography allowed. Unlike Italy where you could take pictures of all the beauty.","July 20, 2019"
"This is a Christopher Wrenn masterpiece and the final resting place of many military leaders. The hike to to top is definitely worth the trip and not as strenuous as it sounds. There is a great tribute to the American soldiers who died in WWll. In addition to all of that, it is an active place of worship. It's worth the visit for several reasons.","July 20, 2019"
"Went to see the church due to its importance in overall British history. The church itself is lovely and there is much to see on the main level. I found the crypt was actually my favorite place to discover the memorials and markers for famous people in British history. It was peaceful, but required you to look at the floor & the walls to find some of the very important markers.I wanted to go to the whispering gallery, but could not as it was closed the day of the visit. We thought we were climbing up to that gallery via the stairs, but soon learned our error. Note, if you are claustrophobic, do not do this climb, especially when London is having a heat wave. The stairs are close and airless and the humidity that day was oppressive. We were not warned of this in advance by the staff in front of this access.Despite being out of shape and in our late 40's, my sister in law and I did make it to the top of the 500+ steps to see the view of London laid out in front of us. While it was a great view - I would recommend for those with limited physical capabilities or claustrophobia like I have that a view from the London Eye is just as good and a whole lot less difficult.","July 20, 2019"
"Didn't pre book tickets so had to wait for some 20 mins to clear security before buying our tickets. If you pre book you are more or less straight through security.Multi lingual headsets available (included in price) and give a comprehensive guide through the Cathedral.Whispering gallery/floor closed on our visit so it was all the way to the top , last third becomes narrower/steeper but easily accessible. One way system operates on last third Once at the top the views are tremendous, if only you could buy a cold refreshment there as you can do at the Shard. Thoroughly recommend.","July 20, 2019"
"Its beautiful, but at 20 quid, its expensive to enter. Not worth that kind of money in my opinion to go in. Notre Dame and Cologne cathedrals were free to enter.","July 20, 2019"
Arrived a tad late for tour but happened to have a mass in 15 minutes. We stayed and enjoyed a service and Latin chorus it was great. Afterwords we wandered around and enjoyed the first level of the church,"July 19, 2019"
"St. Paul’s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey are the two main churches in London.St. Paul’s Cathedral is located in the City of London and you can see it from everywhere from the opposite side of the Thames. It’s now at the end of the Millennium Bridge.You can take lovely pics from outside and inside.The climax is for me the Whispering Gallery .You have to go upstairs to the gallery and there you can hear this sonic anomaly.The way up is sometimes really narrow, but the goal is perfect.","July 19, 2019"
"Beautiful church with plenty of history behind it. If you are physically able, take the stairs up to the galleries on top of the church, it’s well worth the climb and you’d get a great view of the city. ","July 19, 2019"
A trip to London without visiting St. Paul's is out of the question. Christopher Wren's work shines in this cathedral. If possible walk up the winding staircase in the dome at least half way. The views of the city are fantastic.,"July 19, 2019"
"We used our bus passes,free in the England,to get here,viewing all sights on the way.We are Seniors,and active,sight see,ersAs we alighted the bus we were amazed at the huge dome and size of the building,so we walked around the perimiter,past the long que of visiters waiting in line to enter,then circum navigateing around its perimiter,shady gardens,display board of its history.Then on to London bridge,whistle stop tour.","July 18, 2019"
I love this Cathedral and attended an organ program. The beautiful music and outstanding architecture made for an enjoyable experience. ,"July 17, 2019"
"Even if you don’t go inside, this cathedral is magnificent. In my opinion, the best way to experience it is to go to a church service. Whatever your religious affiliation, or not, it is a moving experience. My husband and I went to Sunday morning mass...10 am, about an hour long. And if you go for a service, there is no admission charge!","July 17, 2019"
"Absolutely beautiful working church, that serves more like a museum than a church. We hiked up the top and were rewarded by a breathtaking view of London. It's super crowded, so it wasn't easy to walk around, but the site was something to behold.","July 17, 2019"
"We attended an Evensong Service at St. Paul's and highly recommend this quiet, beautiful service as a lovely way to experience the Cathedral. The service happens daily, and we went at 5 pm. In addition to getting to see the beautiful interior of the church without paying admission, it was also a nice chance to rest our tired feet after a full day of walking! We arrived around 4:45, and as we walked in they announced that the Quire was open for seating. We were lucky enough to get a seat in the Quire, which provided a stunning view of the High Altar. The service itself was brief and contemplative, allowing us the chance to really experience the majesty and tranquility of the Cathedral.","July 17, 2019"
"Impressive, large, brilliantly decorated. Great help from volunteers. Good audio guide, please allow at least 2 hours for your stay.","July 17, 2019"
Sadly it's come to this . £20! Quite annoying seeing as my spending of £50 at the church shop surely bore them some profit.Admire the architecture from the outside!,"July 17, 2019"
"I was lucky enough to have a chance to watch the chorus to sing hymns, they sang beautifully!!! I enjoy visit St. Paul's Cathedral","July 16, 2019"
Went to visit St Pauls what a wonderful experience. Staff are so nice and helpful and willing to answer any questions. Went to the crypt which was great and climbed the steps to the top of the dome. Queues were big but staff efficient and we moved quickly. Views from the top spectacular. Stayed for evensong which was the icing on the cake. Hearing the choir sent a shiver down my spine. If you only do one thing in London make it St Pauls!,"July 16, 2019"
"Evensong at St. Paul's was a beautiful and centering pause in a busy sightseeing day. Regardless of your faith background or lack of it, I believe everyone can feel the timeless sacredness of the traditional evensong worship.","July 15, 2019"
St Paul’s Cathedral is a must see attraction in London. The history of the building is impressive and the views from the top are even more impressive. I highly recommend visiting the cathedral and taking the hike to the top.,"July 15, 2019"
"If you go to London, take this short walk over to St Paul's to experience this magnificent cathedral. While you will pay to get in, the money is well spent. Be sure to visit the underground areas as well. ","July 15, 2019"
"Visiting St Paul on a clear day is a must, when you arrive at the top after 528 steps, the reward is so satisfying. 360 views of London and unparalleled. Photo are not allowed inside, I guess they are protecting the beautiful photo ceiling from copycat. Highly recommend but make sure you eat well before the climb.","July 13, 2019"
"We had visited St. Paul’s three years prior as part of a tour group and, unfortunately, didn’t have time to really explore. This visit, we were on our own and took the time to join one of the cathedral's own guides who gave us a more thorough understanding of the magnificent structure. I would absolutely recommend doing this. St. Paul's guides are well versed in the history and art and give a very good tour. Our guide talked about the view from the top of the dome so we took the challenge to climb all 528 steps to the top (there is no lift). Don’t get so caught up in the steps that you miss the small glassed hole near the top that will give you a view straight down to the floor of the cathedral. The view of London from the summit is spectacular but hold onto your hat. It’s windy!","July 13, 2019"
"Beautiful to take photos at from the outside, if you get the chance to walk thru the garden when it’s open or sit in it, i would definitely do it. Very peaceful.The £20 charge to go inside is too steep tho. It’s only free to go in for worship service. ","July 12, 2019"
"We visited St Paul’s due to having a London Pass. When we arrived at St Paul’s we decided to go on the guided tour which was 90 minutes long but I definitely recommend it, you get to go to areas of the cathedral what the public aren’t allowed to and also find out lots of interesting facts about the cathedral. After our tour we went up the stairs to the galleries (528 to the golden gallery) although it was a lot of steps it wasn’t that tiring as there is quite a bit of space for rests in between and other floors. The only problem is there is no wheelchair access to the top as it is all stairs. But once you reach the golden gallery the views are incredible.","July 12, 2019"
"We brought 18 college students to SPC as part of a class on the Culture and Economics of the United Kingdom. Several did walk all the way to the top. They loved the view. The audio/video guide is excellent. The artwork is amazing. If you are not awed by the architecture, you may never be awed.","July 12, 2019"
Prepurchase entry to avoid a long queue.well worth a visit as its a wonderful well presented cathederal.guides are very knowledgable and give a breakdown of the sights 1000 year history,"July 12, 2019"
"St. Paul’s Cathedral is a MUST SEE in London. While the architecture is certainly amazing as is its rich history, you MUST go climb the stairs to the top. It’s a long and narrow climb which my mom and sister wouldn’t do. As a very claustrophobic person, I can attest that it’s truly worth it. The view at the top is unbeatable. Must do!","July 12, 2019"
"This was our first stop with our London Pass - and rigthly so! The outside architecture was stunning, and the inside was jaw-dropping. We spent more than an hour inside, but there were more to see. Very rich in culture and history.","July 12, 2019"
"This is a very impressive cathedral, both inside and out. It cost 20 pound per adult, 17.50 if over 60.The ceilings are awesome and the dome is very impressive. I went up to the top of the Dome and the views are spectacular, worth the 500+ steps up.If you are in London, it is worth the look.","July 12, 2019"
"great audio tour, but definitely sign up for the separate Triforium tour, gets you to the ""attic"" and other off limits rooms, though the library is closed for renovations","July 11, 2019"

"This is a stunning and beautiful building, but at £20 it isn’t cheap. If you don’t like heights or confined spaces then the balconies aren’t for you and the Whispering Gallery was closed to allThe audio guide is superbIt’s a “must see” but you’d only go once! And if you want to light a candle to a loved one that’s an extra donation","July 11, 2019"
"St Paul's is such an iconic sight on London's skyline and the inside is something to be seen.We booked tickets on-line the day before our visit which are discounted against the gate price. Tickets get you access to all areas of the cathedral, inside is huge and there is plenty of room for those exploring and those worshipping.Photos are permitted except during services.We explored the stone and golden galleries, access to both is by stairs, 528 steps in total and 85 metres from the Cathedral floor but the views are worth every step.","July 11, 2019"
"Amazing 360-degree view after climbing 528 stairs (be aware, no lift!). Unfortunately, the Whisper gallery is closed until further notice. You need at least 1.5 hours to visit it properly, knowing that quite some spaces close 45 minutes prior next service.Tip: use the 2 for 2 offer from National Rail (also on Travelcard) to save on entry fee!","July 11, 2019"
"We bought our tickets thru this app. Entrance was easy. Once in past ticket desk, to your right is where to ask about a guided tour. We highly recommend it. The guide was excrllent and funny. Lasted 90 minutes and we felt we had see all of the best spaces. It is a lovely place of worship.","July 10, 2019"
I have always wanted to visit St Paul's cathedral and I had the opportunity to visit yesterday and I wasn't disappointed as it was quite impressive. I would have liked to have gone inside but there was a bit of a queue and time was a bit of a premium so maybe next time.,"July 9, 2019"
"I was in awe of this magnificent and beautiful cathedral. The architecture and design is beautiful. We climbed the over 500 steps to the dome! Then the crypt contains many beautiful effigies and tombs. We were there a little over an hour and could have stayed longer. They held mass and prayer at different times while we were there. Amazing to see where Princess Diana and Prince Charles were married, and the Queen’s Jubilee....","July 9, 2019"
"The cathedral is stunning. The symbolism in the design, stained glass and wall paintings is very inspriing.","July 9, 2019"
"My friend and I went to St.Puals yesterday. As we both had bought a weeks rail card we were able to claim the ‘2-for-1’ special which definitely was worth it. You just need to register online, print the paper and present it at the queue when purchasing tickets. The cathedral is absolutely amazing! We were lucky enough to see the choice practicing. The walk up to the very top is quit the adventure! There are wooden steps up one part and then to get to the top it’s a spiral metal staircase. Definitely not for the feint hearted!","July 8, 2019"
"Beautiful cathedral!! Pre paid tickets gets you in slightly faster, but if you have no ticket I recommend you arrive at opening or slightly after as the line gets a bit long. The cathedral is so interesting, make sure you get the headphones to hear about the history. Also, only climb the stairs to the top if you are semi fit! There is a lot!! If you want a great picture of the cathedral, head to the shopping centre close by and go up the lift to the top level you will get a magnificent photo ","July 8, 2019"
St Paul's cathedral is an architectural wonder. To have the most serene experience you have to visit inside. There are 2 ways. First is you do a guided tour with tickets costing somewhere around £20-25. The second way is that you visit the cathedral when there is a service. We went in at the 5pm service so it was free to go but there was no tour. Either way going inside is a must to see the spectacular architecture. Also you can go to the top with some additional £5.,"July 8, 2019"
"We visited St. Paul's cathedral in March. The dome is a London landmark, and survived the Battle of Britain thanks to volunteers on the roof who removed German incedndiary bombs by hand during the raids. The inside is awesome, with displays showing its history, including how it changed after the London fire in the 1600's. For Harry Potter fans, a staircase used in the movies for Hogwarts is just inside the front entrance.","July 7, 2019"
"An amazing place, we took a guided tour in St.Paul's rather than the recorded audio tour. The guide was excellent and answered all questions. The interior is absolutely stunning and difficult to describe. Do not miss St.Paul's.","July 7, 2019"
Went to the consecration of four bishops all women and three close colleagues of my wife. Very warm welcome. Real concern on access and disability . Fantaatic choir. Service printed on recycled paper. Thanks,"July 7, 2019"
The wait for entry was lengthy so pre-book tickets. Apart from heading straight in you save £3 a ticket. Your entrance fee includes complimentary head sets in various languages. Personally I’d use the do it yourself option and wander at your leisure. This way you can take everything in at your own pace. We tackled the 528 steps to the top gallery. The view over London is magnificent however a couple of words of warning. To get to the first gallery is about 300 steps and once you start you really have to go to the top. There are stops for a breather and make sure you use them. To get to the very top however involves a vertically winding metal staircase wide enough for you. It has the added attraction of holes in the treads - I don’t like heights and to be honest found the last 100 plus steps a bit scary and claustrophobic. Worth it though. When back on ground level make sure you take the time to do the place justice. You can easily spend several hours taking it all in. It’s a magnificent building and inside is quite stunning. ,"July 7, 2019"
"It was Sunday, in between services and the Organist was playing - sit in a pew before your legs give way underneath you from the sheer majesty of the beautiful sound coupled with the majestic soaring ceilings of St Pauls! I feel blessed to have been in such an incredible place hearing the most magnificent music surround me and fill me with emotion and awe. ","July 6, 2019"
"Don’t miss visiting St Paul’s, and then, don’t skip the hike to the top of the dome. The views are amazing and unforgettable. The interior is amazing as well. ","July 6, 2019"
"The price of admission is rather steep at 20 pounds but this remarkable architectural gem is still worthy of a visit. The highlight was the climb up to the walkway on the outside of the dome. I thought we were going to end up in the Whispering Gallery inside the dome but as you wind your way up the cramped, steep, twisty 500+ steps you arrive at the top to amazing views of London. The climb is not for the unfit or nervous, at points in the climb we had to stop on metal staircases that made me feel a little queasy as it felt you could easily fall down on top of the people below. My legs and knees were aching on the next day and I am in decent shape. Had a cup of tea in the cafe down by the crypts and couldn't help observing that it was a little strange to have a cafe and shop down where so many famous people are interred, seemed a little crass to me.","July 6, 2019"
"St. Paul's Cathedral now charges...and not cheaply....to visit. Decades ago that wasn't the case. Now, whenever I am in London and want to visit the Cathedral I go to Evensong Services. Services begin at 5:00 so I will arrive 25-30 minutes a head of time and that allows me a few minutes to walk around and savor the atmosphere. I will sit on the left side as close to the end of a row as I can.....an announcement will be made about sitting in the 'choir section' and I will then precede to the opened door/attendant who will allow a limited number of visitors into that section for the service. It's a wonderful way to end the day.","July 5, 2019"
The use of audio guide proved very successfully to improve the experience of tourists. Everybody could experience the history of St. Paul Cathedral at his own pace.We can also stop to take pictures at any time . Nice trip,"July 5, 2019"
The cathedral was a beautiful huge structure and we were there for the opening itself. Early in the morning we did the audio guide tour and it gives a history of the cathedral. We did not do the climb to the top but it is so beautiful on the inside and some eminent people are buried here. Not to be missed.,"July 4, 2019"
"Next to St Peter’s Cathedral in Rome, this is one of the largest churches within the Christian world. Needless to say, it is a central piece for the Anglican Church. It is also the place where famous intellectuals are buried, for instance, Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Stephen Hawking. Here, traditional England meets contemporary Britain. This tour is suitable for the whole family. Do not miss it.","July 4, 2019"
"From the exterior, this is a massive cathedral and we visited as part of a walking tour. St. Paul is the seat of the Bishop of London and the mother church of the Diocese of London. Entry is pretty strict (i.e. bag checks) and they discourage visits when a service/mass is in progress. TIP: you can can enter (for free) if attending for worship.In my opinion, there are more impressive churches in London, like Westminster. However, St. Paul is considered one of the most beautiful buildings in the world.","July 4, 2019"
I'm not sure we would have paid the 20 pounds each had we not had the London Pass. That made it worthwhile and it was a beautiful cathedral. Glad we went!,"July 4, 2019"
Saint Paul's Cathedral seems to be plain from the outside. Inside is a different story. One of the most impressive Churches I have ever seen. Well worth the time to explore and learn about it's history.,"July 4, 2019"
The inside may be fine but charging 20 pounds to enter seems a bit steep. They claim to be a church but yet make such charges. My wife and I would have liked to go and offer a few prayers but would not spend 20 pounds each( about 50 US dollars) to do so. ,"July 4, 2019"
"This cathedral is truly beautiful. The architecture and the magnitude of the cathedral is amazing. I highly recommend taking the hike to the top! There are 528 steps to view the city from the dome at 365 feet. It’s all stairs up and down. Going up, of course, was challenging due to some tight spaces. If you are very tall, watch your head! The way down was a breeze! At the top, it is tight and you walk in a line, in a clockwise direction. There isn’t much room to move around. The views are absolutely breathtaking and this was definitely a highlight of our trip! Well worth the effort to climb to the top. And it was a great way to work off all that beer and fish and chips we had for lunch ","July 4, 2019"
"After a less-than-satisfying visit to the Tower of London, we decided not to risk wasting the high admission cost to see inside the cathedral lest we experience what we experienced at the Tower. Outside it looked interesting.","July 4, 2019"
a very good place and also a historical place to visit. u must visit this place when you visit london. ,"July 3, 2019"
"The audio tour that is free with entrance to the Cathedral is extremely well done, and I would highly recommend taking the time to use it. I have attended Even song there in the past, but taking the tour with the audio guide helped me appreciate it so much more.","July 3, 2019"
"This is a beautiful piece of art. From the outside in, there is much to keep your eyes attention. Magnificent.","July 3, 2019"
I attended an Evensong there which was very enjoyable and I also enjoyed walking around the cathedral. I didn't do the official tour.,"July 3, 2019"
"I arrived to the St. Paul Cathedral shortly before 11:00 am just in time for the 90 minutes Verger’s tour, which is included in the ticket price. The tour was informative but unfortunately our guide spoke very quietly and it was really hard to hear him. I wanted to go up to the Whispering Gallery but it was closed (a teen fell to his death from the gallery at the end of March). My husband and I had done the climb all the way to the roof many years ago and it was the most challenging one we had ever tried anywhere in the world. The tour of the Crypt and heroic history of the Cathedral during the WWII were the main reasons I opted for a 90 minutes tour, but there are also 30 minute tours available for those who just want an overview. I never expected to spend 3 hours in the Cathedral, but I did and am really happy about it: it was enough time to appreciate its beauty inside and outside and get a solid history lesson. Sir Christopher Wren created a stunning architectural masterpiece which has become a landmark of London. It is one of my own favorite cathedrals in the world. ","July 2, 2019"
Beautiful !!!! Included with the London Pass. Walked up to the dome. Not worth it. A lot of steps. You can see the same view London skyline without the steps from other attractions. ,"July 2, 2019"
The view inside this gorgeous cathedral is breathtaking and not one to be missed. The history of St. Paul's Cathedral is extensive so try to take a tour led by a tour guide to get the best visit.,"July 2, 2019"
We were astounded to see that well over 300 people attended the super Evensong with twelve choristers who sounded like 30. Then we found out that the 20 pound entrance fee is waived for the services. Twenty quid? what are these people thinking of???,"July 2, 2019"
"The queue to get in was not very long and a queue only forms due to security checks, which is understandable. Pick up the audio or join one of the guided tours to get the full history, and information on what is held there. We did not do the whispering gallery but it was open. The crypt has some lovely monuments, and the shop is worth a visit. A good couple of hours spent here worth the entry fee.","July 2, 2019"
"We got in free if you went to the quick Eucharistic Mass. It is very beautiful to see this building, however, I am not sure I would have paid the money. Westminster Abbey, on the other-hand, WAS worth the money. So, if you can get in free to attend Mass, then I would do it that way. ","July 1, 2019"
"St Pauls is definitely worth a visit if you are in London. you can buy the tickets easy enough just there. there is also a lovely little coffee shop just beside it and you can get snacks etc there. i think the best day to go there is a sunday as you can get a service too. it is also on the big bus tour, so you can get off and have a look around. this is a beautiful part of london.","July 1, 2019"
"St. Paul's was included on the London Pass and it was wonderful! No line ups, lots to see and explore and one of the very few places you're able to take photos! The crypt was so fascinating with many famous people buried there. ","June 30, 2019"
"You will likely encounter long lines, but it is a definitely worth visiting.I would recommend a guided tour as there is so much to see and it's hard to know what you are really looking at. We went for a part of a guided tour, but unfortunately, our guide wasn't that good, so we cut it short and counted on the audio guide, which was okay, but none of the information really stuck.Travelling to the top of the dome is fun, but not for those who are easily claustrophobic or have difficulty climbing stairs.The view of the city from above is great.","June 30, 2019"
"Upon arrival at St Paul’s, we took a tour - with Lena - who was great. And told us so much about the cathedral, and it’s history. It’s always a good idea to do the tours anywhere you go. You can only see a small part of such an historic and enormous building anyway.We visited on a beautiful day - and consequently saw the mosaics with the sun shining on them.Though personally, we preferred the cathedral as first built in plain stone (nave), without the Victorian amendments. They clearly involved an enormous amount of work, but appeared (to us) to detract from Wren’s original idea of space and light.We stayed for the sung evensong, which was amazing. Much credit to the choir and the choir master.","June 30, 2019"
"This large church is similar to St Peter's in Rome in scale and the Pantheon in Paris in size and purpose. it is filled with memorials to the war dead and military heroes. Be sure to see the monuments and tombs of Wellington and Nelson. The space is very impressive and is fun just to sit in and look around.Do climb to the top of the dome. It is a lot of steps and is quite crowded as you get near the top, as the stairways are narrow, steep and spiral (don't wear a short skirt, as people behind you may be entertained on the walk up). The view from the top is great, but again very crowded. So you will not be able to just stand and enjoy the view. But we love to climb to the top of everything.","June 29, 2019"
"If you wish to see the Cathedral without the fee, look up the service times and arrive a half-hour early. There is security to enter/bag check and no photos are allowed inside. I dont know the procedure or times for climbing up he tower of the church. I believe there is a fee to go up.","June 29, 2019"
"An iconic cathedral, worth a visit, but try go on Sunday as it is free. The rest of the week there is an admission fee. 20UK Pounds per person. Though it a bit steep it is worth it.","June 28, 2019"
Lots of Amazing things to see and the views are incredible. Be aware if you want to walk to the top tower its a LOT of steps. And can be tiring unless you are in good shape. But once up there the view is great,"June 28, 2019"
"This cathedral is just gorgeous, inside and out! It's worth the fee to go inside and take the self-guided audio tour. If you are really adventuresome and very fit, take the 528 stairs to the Golden Gallery, which is actually at near the top of the dome and is a walkway around the outside. Great views of London from all angles. Don't miss the crypt with the tombs of The Duke of Wellington and others. No words can describe the beauty of the interior of this cathedral. Second only to St. Peter's in Rome.","June 27, 2019"

We stumbled across this beautiful old church on a recent trip. We decided not to go inside as the entry fee is rather steep. Instead we admired the church from the outside and walked around the gardens for a little while. A very lovely way to spend an hour or so.,"June 27, 2019"
An ordinary cathedral just like the one you see all around eroupe. Nothing very exciting about it...,"June 26, 2019"
We didn’t do the paid tour but just walked in the beautiful church and marveled at its size and magnificent design. Truly is a sight to see. There was a music program about to begin so we heard the organ and some singing. The organ was great and it was just a practice....,"June 26, 2019"
I spent three hours touring this lovely piece of architecture. Got there around 10 which was the perfect time. Walked around with a self guided tour until 10:30 when I got on a 90 minute free! Guided tour. So worth it! Afterwards I walked up the 500+ steps for a spectacular view of London! It was amazing! Walked back down and was able to catch the daily sermon and communion. I even lost my sunglasses and they found them! If you have kids make sure they are interested in history if they go in the tour,"June 26, 2019"
"We visited first Westminster Abbey, that was a complete zoo outside and badly organized, but here it seems someone knows how to handle the visitors. With the London Pass you can go easier inside. It is just a magnificent place. Take your time to visit","June 26, 2019"
"My wife, grandson and I visited St. Paul’s Cathedral during our visit to London. All of us were very impressed with its beauty and the peaceful feeling we had while inside the great church. We also learned about the history of St. Paul’s from the exhibits housed inside and it’s a marvelous history. We would certainly recommend a stop at St. Paul’s during your London visit. ","June 26, 2019"
"Visited here last week - absolutely beautiful building (IMO much more engaging than Westminster Abbey) - the audio guide is essential and superb. Making the effort - and it IS an effort - to go to the first viewing gallery, that look out over London is highly recommended. We made the effort to climb to the top much much smaller vlewing gallery - but it is a little scary making the climb using wrought-iron stairs - once at the top, it's not scary at all - In my opinion. Overall this is on of the Top 10 attraction in London - worth every penny.","June 26, 2019"
"We were two families from Texas spending 2 weeks on a European vacation, visiting London, Paris and Barcelona European 14 Day trip from Texas. We had spent months planning this trip, to get the best bang for our bucks and see as many sites as possible. We have been to Rome and have seen many splendid Cathedral, but we always enjoy the splendor of each and every grand church that have been built. What sets this Cathedral apart from others, is that you are able to walk up the stairways to an outside balcony with great views of London. The stairs are steep, winding and many, but every before and after us were able to make the steps. Usually when we visit cities with large skyscrapers, we will go to the top to see city views. Since St. Paul offered these views, we passed on going up the Shard Tower.","June 25, 2019"
"Even though you'd have to pay an entry fee, St. Paul's is worth it. It is absolutely lovely inside, very bright and welcoming. I've been to St. Peter's in Rome, and St. Paul's is nicer.","June 25, 2019"
I’ve visited the majority of London tourist spots now and this is definitely one of my favourites. Entry is pricy but well worth it as it’s incredible beautiful and peaceful. Just sitting and soaking up the atmosphere/looking at the ornate building is wonderful. ,"June 25, 2019"
"We planned on being at St Paul's when they first opened and that worked out great. It got so much more crowded as the day went on. I would definitely recommend doing a free tour. It was so informative. It is such a beautiful cathedral. If you are physically able, definitely do the 528 stairs to the top. The view is stunning and worth the strain on your muscles.","June 24, 2019"
"When I was a child we visited London a lot & I always insisted that we must go to St Paul's and up to the top. I adored the Cathedral and of all of the religious places all over the world to visit it has always been my favourite.I haven't been for years as the last time we visited London I thought the price was pretty steep and we didn't really have the time to spend hours there to justify the price. This year I noticed that you could gain entry with using Tesco vouchers so decided that I really must show my husband the wonders of St Paul's during our visit.We chose to start our visit by going upwards and I was dismayed that the Whispering Gallery was closed! It was always so interesting in there and to see the Cathedral from that view point is a must. I understand the reasoning of why it is shut but maybe have supervised groups of 10 at a time so you don't miss out or a reduction in the price you pay as one of the main attraction is shut off.We went up to the stone then golden galleries and marvelled in the views over London. Yes there are higher vantage points and better views but there really is something special about the vista when you head through the door of the Golden gallery after climbing all those steps, it really is breathtaking.The Cathedral is very well kept and all the artifacts are pristine and so much to see and take in. Plenty of staff to answer any questions and we were really lucky when I left my phone on a bench that it was handed in an given back to us quickly. The crypt is vast and some famous historic names to look out for.I still Love the place and was really glad to go but honestly at £20 per person is too much for what you get. I understand the upkeep for the place is a lot of money but with the amount of people going through the doors per day paying £20 a time you would have to be an idiot to think that it was all going on the upkeep of the Cathedral!","June 24, 2019"
We enjoyed walking around the sanctuary and crypt. You can just imagine the history that is within the walls of this special church. It has a very nice gift shop as well. ,"June 23, 2019"
"In order to enter St. Paul's Cathedral you have to pay for a ticket and it is not cheap. But you are given an audio guide. Unlike the Abbey, you are allowed to take pictures in the Cathedral. The architecture is stunning and you can go up the stairs to the dome for breathtaking views of the city. The Cathedral is beautiful and well worth a visit.","June 23, 2019"
Stunning building. Wonderful interior. Scary tour. Go up to the whispering gallery and you are high up- but there are 2 more levels to go- an insde and outside experiece ! Some 'famous' remains in the crypts ! ,"June 23, 2019"
What a site. The cathedral was beautiful. Kinda out of the way but definitely worth the trip. I would go again I can.,"June 23, 2019"
So much of history at this cathedral. The architecture is stunningly beautiful. Be sure to go down through the vault. Climbing the stairs up to the dome are worth the city views. 2 levels around the dome. With the higher level more exhilarating. Recommend going soon after opening time to avoid lines and crowds. Definitely worth a visit on a visit to London! ,"June 22, 2019"
" A spectacular cathedral with a slightly confusing audio tour. Admission price is somewhat high, but I am glad I saw this historic church.","June 22, 2019"
"The beauty of St. Paul's Cathedral is inexplicable. The audio tour is a must. There is so much information. If you plan to view the galleries, there are no paintings there. Galleries are vistas fro which you can see most of London. You must climb many flights of stairs up narrow spiral staircases, but it is well worth the effort - even if you are sore for a few days afterward. This is a must-see.","June 22, 2019"
" The Cathedral is beautiful and rich in history but the biggest reason to visit might be the view. If you do not mind climbing 500+ steep steps you will get a chance to see main parts of the beautiful London panorama. It is breathtaking and worth the climb. If not you will see a beautiful Cathedral with an amazing Henry Moore sculpture and a crypt with Nelson's, Florence Nightingale's and Duke Wellington's tomb. ","June 22, 2019"
An amazing huge cathedral close to Thames at the heart of London. The place where the majority of great events took place within decades. Don’t miss. ,"June 22, 2019"
Take a tour of the Cathedral and learn about its history. We were lucky to attend a pipe organ concert. ,"June 21, 2019"
"We took our 2 children along and we all got the audio guide that’s included in the entry price. The kids got a special version. It was great, with tailored interesting info and had little finding games. It really helped them connect to the experience. Shame that the whispering gallery was closed due to recent suicides but highly recommend the stairs for the view from the top. Amazing architecture. ","June 21, 2019"
Historical and religious place that survived the Blitzkrieg (WWII) almost intact. You can visit the interiors and surrounding gardens. Beautiful architecture. There's a tube station few blocks from there.The neighborhood is also pretty cool to have a walk after the visit.,"June 21, 2019"
We were lucky enough to arrive just before a service and stayed to worship. The acoustics in this cathedral made the choir sound like angels! This is a magnificent treasure worth seeing.,"June 20, 2019"
"Beautiful architecture and a historic cathedral, where Charles and Di got married. Well worth walking around inside and seeing the history of people in the crypt. ","June 20, 2019"
"Pretty much everyone reviews the Cathedral itself, but there are also lovely gardens all round it and a little known extension to its Festival Gardens right across the road and right next to the glitzy One New Change shopping and office complex. It’s a real oasis of peace and quiet, with seating and a variety of mature trees and flower beds. ","June 20, 2019"
This was an amazing experience. It’s a pretty big castle and we got the audio headset to listen in self tour. The work is church is intricate and absolutely fascinating. Photography is not allowed when sermon is going on. lots of walking especially if you decide to walk to the top for a view. There are about 600 steps one way to go to the top for the view. This was a very memorable visit.,"June 20, 2019"
"St Paul’s is a stunning space with so much history. The central dome and ceiling is outstanding. We headed as a family for a few hours looking around. Typically we are the sorts that like to really listen to the audios and take our time. The last place we intended to visit was the Quire but without any warning this area was shut at 4pm. When I enquired I was told that was the time it shut - but this isn’t signed anywhere. If we had known that we would have planned our visit accordingly and saved the audio of the nave and dome until later (as we were staying for Evensong anyway). I explained to a member of staff that we hadn’t seen the Quire, and he said if we told the ticket desk we could come back on Monday. This wasn’t a good enough response in my opinion. Our weekend away had other plans for rest of trip. Secondly, if I’m paying such a large entry charge, I expect to be made aware of when areas shut so I can plan my family visit accordingly. It is seriously one of the first times I have felt ripped off by a top attraction, and it took the edge off my visit. I’m not likely to want to pay the full entrance again just to see the Quire. That aside it is a wonderful building and worth exploring if in London. The review should have been 5 star review though. ","June 20, 2019"
OMG. what a place. some much character. so much pomp and ceremony . so much artistry. defianely worth a look,"June 20, 2019"
We found St Paul’s to be really interesting and picturesque inside. Got a few happy snaps then did the climb to the top of the dome which was well worth it for the photos of London we got. We scored a hot day for London so was a bit hot at the top but made for some super shots. ,"June 20, 2019"
Must see. Lovely guided tour. Located in area with many eating places. Close to stations in the area.,"June 20, 2019"
Amazing history and well worth the visit. I did this as part of exploring my ancestry and was able to get contact information to check further.,"June 20, 2019"
I've seen pictures and documentary videos and was still overwhelmed by the beauty of this historic church. You must stop by and take a look for yourself.,"June 19, 2019"
"Admission to St. Paul’s cathedral includes an audio guide - if you are visiting on your own take advantage of the opportunity to learn about this magnificent and historic cathedral. On previous visits I hadn’t used the audio guide and frankly missed out on some interesting information!This is a working cathedral so you may be fortunate to visit during a service. The whispering gallery was closed during our visit but the dome is open if you dare to climb up. Incredible views of the city reward those who do that.We enjoyed the informative tour, especially with regard to the crypt area. Down there is a timeline of the city which includes the various historical eras of the cathedral. You can also learn about some of the famous folks who have been either buried there or remembered with plaques.We enjoyed our walk to the cathedral, and then continued on to St. Bartholomew’s and then to the Museum of London. Lots to see along the way!","June 18, 2019"
I would highly recommend visiting St Pauls cathedral ! It was beautiful inside and out! Its a must see,"June 18, 2019"
St Pauls is well worth a visit an absolutely stunning place and so interesting well worth the visit do the stairs if you are brave enough and got the energy we didn't,"June 18, 2019"
"The vast mosaics, the incredible architecture, and wonderfully executed acoustics - St. Paul's cannot be missed! Whether you consider yourself religious or not, it's worth seeing this beautiful church. If, however, you do consider yourself to be religious, I highly recommend taking in at least one service, whether it be Evensong or Eucharist, while in London. There is something magical about gathering together with people from all over the world in one of the most beautiful places, united in one, positive action that is worth experiencing. but I will emphasize, it's still worth seeing even if you don't associate with the Christian faith largely because of the art and history of the place. ","June 18, 2019"
amazing- a must see. The decor inside is breathtaking and it is hard to image this was constructed many moons ago without all the technology we possess and rely on today.This was value for money and would recommend getting a London pass and visit many places within the area of Westminster and surrounding district.,"June 18, 2019"
"We took the tube to the St. Paul’s stop and found that the station basically stands in the shadow of the cathedral. Only a few people were lingering on the steps outside when we went in. Unfortunately, photography isn’t allowed inside, so I only made one picture of the side of the nave before seeing the sign. The space is large and impressive and that early in the morning there were fewer tourists inside. I’d heard about the Whispering Gallery, so I was disappointed to discover that it was closed the day we were there (I’ve since been horrified to learn that it closed a month before our visit because somebody had died), but the Stone Gallery and the Golden Gallery were both open. At 257 and 376 steps up, respectively, the galleries can only be reached by visitors via spiral staircases. Girding my loins, we began the slow ascent and I’m happy to report that the views at the top were absolutely worth the risk of cardiac arrest.The views from the Golden Gallery weren’t substantially better, and the sense of vertigo I got from looking over the parapet was palpable, but I still felt a real sense of accomplishment for climbing all that way. At one point, there’s a small circle in the floor near the top of the stairs positioned exactly in the middle above the dome where you can look down into the cathedral, spying the chairs assembled far below.","June 17, 2019"
"Visited St. Paul's as part of a city tour. It is a beautiful church with soaring ceilings, gorgeous arches and a dome that is stunning. The history of this church is very interesting. Would have liked more time to explore.","June 17, 2019"
"Went to St Paul’s on an early morning visit. Eldest son and I went in. Wonderful visit, amazed by the vastness and the history. Went up to the galleries - a bit steep and vertigo inducing going up to the golden gallery, but the views from the top were worth it. Been coming to London since 1975 and this was the first time I had been into St Paul’s. Loved it","June 17, 2019"
"It is a grand church, quite large with an interesting history. From the ancient Roman foundations to the way that the church was designed and built to shreds even though they had been rejected by the king and the church, through to the way the volunteers saved the church from fire and bombings during WW2","June 17, 2019"
This is another must see when in London. It contains so much history and the place just leave one in awe. The only downside is that no picture are allowed. Purchase your ticket online for a discount and the skip the line add on is totally worth it.,"June 16, 2019"
"We have been to St Paul’s twice. Both times we left in awe. We had the London pass so we didn’t pay to get in. They have an audio tour guide if you like. It is beautiful. Unlike many cathedrals, they do allow photos as long as there is no flash. We did not do the stair climb to the top as we were short on time. Definitely something you do not want to miss.","June 16, 2019"
"The oldest medieval cathedral in London.The dome with the art was a treat to watch. It was the place where Prince Charles and Lady Diana got married and the Queens silver, diamond and golden birthday celebrations were held. There is a crypt at the bottom which housed the remains of many greats such as Lord Nelson, Florence Nightingale, Sir Alexander Fleming. .","June 16, 2019"
"Stunning.Audio guide is helpful but there is no set path to take so it is easy to miss things and get separated from your group. It is better to set a meeting time and place and explore on your own. Soon after our arrival, a service began and we took communion. Spent about 1-1.5 hours here. We arrived around 1pm and there was no queue and we walked right in and purchased tickets there.Highly recommend a visit.","June 16, 2019"
"St Pauls has been on our 'must visit list' for many years but we have never got around to it until now. It's such an iconic London building from the outside and we were not disappointed with our visit. On entering the Cathedral, the staff on the reception were extremely helpful and pointed us to the guided tours which is included in the ticket price. Prior to our tour starting we had some time to get a feel for the Cathedral. We then joined up with others for our tour to begin. Gary was our tour guide. He spent a shot time getting to know where in the world his audience came from. He had a great sense of humour and his knowledge of the Cathedral and Christopher Wren was educational. The actual tour is about 1hr 30 mins but ours did over run, very much due to Gary’s enthusiasm. For us it was a must having a Tour Guide as there is so much you would miss. After the tour, we climbed to the top of the Cathedral which is some steep climb but the views over London were amazing, even on a wet and cloudy day. Visitors need a minimum of 3 hours to take in this amazing building.","June 16, 2019"
Was there last week..... what a lovely place. Is beautiful and big. The most beautiful is the Dome..... I love the part where the painters are .... is a combination of monochromatic and golden paints all are very nice. The whispering gallery is simple fascinating and the crypt is just well designed.... I can believe I even sat to have coffee with all this dead bodies anyway a experience to remember ☺️,"June 15, 2019"
"We bought tickets on line but there was no queue at 9am on a Saturday and it wasn’t yet overrun with tourists so this was s good time to visit. Get the free audio guide and do the 30-minute highlights. It’s really well done with both videos and audio describing the most significant sights. Be sure to visit the crypt to see Admiral Nelson’s coffin, the Florence Nightengale plaque, and bust of Lawrence of Arabia, among others. The Whispering Gallery was closed and a wedding prevented seeing some of the crypt but still a must-see on your visit.","June 15, 2019"
"It is expensive to enter here but worth it. We came at 4pm and only had half hour to explore. The ticket does, however, give you 12 months validity to re enter. We wish we had more time as this place is so beautiful. I also highly recommend climbing the dome. It is a hard climb but You get amazing views of London","June 15, 2019"
"We spent hours at St Paul’s taking the self guided tour that included a great handheld screen that was easy to use, pausing and restarting segments. ","June 15, 2019"
"The tickets were £20 but the church is beautiful with a lot of history. Bombed in WWII and restored many famous persons buried in the crypt, Admiral Nelson, Duke of Wellington. Also the list of Americans killed in WWII in Europe given to the English by General Eisenhower and a memorial to the Americans in the church.","June 15, 2019"
We were lucky enough to be in London on a Sunday and able to attend a beautiful service at this historic church. The choir sounded amazing with the fabulous acoustics. The beauty of the murals and the overall visual beauty were truly spiritually inspiring. Not a time to be a tourist just to be.,"June 15, 2019"
"I found the cathedral itself absolutely fascinating, however on the occasions I had to communicate with the staff I felt there was a huge lack in any form of manners and politeness, even from the beginingWhen buying our ticket to handing in the audio tapes. No hello, no please, no thank you, not even a welcoming smile!!! My mother is disabled and unable to walk many steps, there is a lift saying available for disabled, when asked, the staff member just rudely stated no lift up.... When we reached the top of the spiraled staircase (a struggle for my mother) there were doors to a lift. Had she of had the support up the spiral stairs she may have made it to the first floor. If there are doors to the lift at the top why does the lift not go up? When asking the staff member at the top of these stairs she sarcastically answered, the stairs are all over the place, you will see!!!!Not a place I will be visiting again!","June 15, 2019"
Wow.. I have no words to describe this beauty.. from out side also it’s damn beautiful and once u enter inside and see wall designs and painting is just amazing and it’s a state of the art .. it also has a viewing gallery or a observation desk from where u can witness entire city but for that u wll have to climb some 250 stairs one way and the climb is steep and has round stairs.. fatty people can’t pass though one thin tunnel so think before u go.. it doesn’t have a life to go up only way is climb.. my 5 year old climber and m so proud of him .. rest it’s manageable and lovely .. ,"June 15, 2019"
"The Cathedral is very interesting as it shows the history of that part of London! It is totally worth it to go to the dome as you will be able to have a great view of the city, although you have to climb many stairs so just be prepared! But I assure you that when you get to the top the view will be amazing!! ","June 14, 2019"
"This is a London Trade mark and u should at least see it from the outside while in London. If you like to look at Amazing builings or of course are a person of faith u should also Go inside. It Costs 20punds but its more worth the Money than for example the London eye in my opinion. If u want (and Can) there is a 500+ steps stair to the dome where there is an outside plateau. If not, just walk around and look at the Amazing details in the decorations. I have been to the Church of Sct Peter in Rome and even if the Sct Pauls is smaller it is nearly as impressive.","June 13, 2019"
"I have been on the steps of St. Paul's before, but I've never had the opportunity to enter it. Beautiful church, so full of history!","June 13, 2019"
No problem with narrow holes and hundreds of steps? then try one of the best panoramic views of London...,"June 13, 2019"
"Magnificent!!! Had a tour booked with Ing Tours, Richard was able to get us all the history and information about St. Paul's without us feeling rushed or that we missed anything.","June 12, 2019"
"Great but popular venue - sometimes get 10,000 visitors a day so best arrival early! Lots to see on all levels, including the crypt! ","June 12, 2019"
Beautiful Cathedral! Amazing artwork and ceiling. You can see where they got the staircase for Harry Potter from this Cathedral! So many hidden treasures here!,"June 12, 2019"
"I was in London twice before but failed to see St. Paul Cathedral. Its location is quite further from the known landmarks. On my third visit, made sure to visit this wonderful cathedral. It is breathtaking. Architecture is mind boggling. Don't miss the gallery where you get a breathtaking view of London and the Thames river. ","June 11, 2019"
"Get in line early or just be patient - it is well worth the wait. St. Paul's is so different from Westminster - Westminster is dark & broody, filled with the weight of kings and queens (but still a place I love to pieces.) St. Paul's is filled with all that natural light that Wren so carefully made certain would flood the building - it's so airy by comparison. As an American I love the American chapel dedicated to the memory of WWII soldiers. As a lover of history - especially military - see the tombs of Nelson and Wellington is quite moving. Wren's tomb is so simple - why have something fancy when one's own amazing cathedral is all you really need to be remembered? One of the many staff/volunteers approached us to ask us how we liked the building and spent some time speaking to us about the history of the place - it is one of my favorite things about the U.K. - every place we visit - people who work or volunteer at a historical site - they are so knowledgeable and proud of their history - and eager and witty about sharing it. And more than a little money was spent at the beautiful gift shop - Wellington & Nelson will hang on our Christmas tree. We added the ticket to St. Paul as the thing to do on our last day in London - and I cannot think of a better way to finish our trip to this beautiful city.","June 11, 2019"
"Amazing place to visit good half day, do yourself a favour (as little ng as your fit enough) and walk the 500+ stairs through the narrow walkway sand steps to the top... very interesting ","June 10, 2019"
"Once of the most important bits of London's skyline, St Paul's still stands out despite the proliferation of skyscrapers. It's partially rebuilt since the war but still an impressive historical structure. It's also alive with public programs as well as services.","June 10, 2019"
Another can’t miss London landmark. The dome is phenomenal. This definitely worth the price of admission. ,"June 10, 2019"
Wren’s masterpiece is magnificent - both as a working place of worship and as an architectural icon. Do not miss the opportunity to climb the dome all the way to the top and be treated to excellent panoramic views of the city as well as getting up close and personal with the interior structure of the dome. Be forewarned - the climb involves a significant number of steps and the spaces can be narrow and claustrophobic.Do not miss the crypt where you will find the resting place of well-known religious and military leaders.,"June 10, 2019"
"A stunning cathedral and a beautiful example of the fine architecture of Sir Christopher Wren. It is well worth visiting this jewel on the London skyline. Some may say the price is a bit steep, so I would highly recommend the included 90 minute guided tour (there is a shorter one too) to make the price more worthwhile. I am not usually one for guided tours, but felt this gave me a deeper understanding of the history, artworks, and architecture of the building as well as the English history which surrounds it from the Great Fire to the Battle of Trafalgar and even Harry Potter. There are so many gorgeous touches to the cathedral that you would never know about otherwise. A visit is not complete without climbing to the top (or as high is open) to appreciate the view across London, in spite of the many steps!","June 10, 2019"
This is the cathedral that Prince Charles married Princess Diana. I think we weren't allowed to take pictures but they did have a nice gift shop that you can pass through on your way to the exit. Prices were reasonable. I got postcards that showed what the inside looks like. Do not miss seeing this magnificent cathedral.,"June 10, 2019"
I have been to many cathedrals but there was something spectacular about this one. It is beyond beautiful. ,"June 10, 2019"
"Walk past here alot and never been inside, great history in this place and architecture is pretty amazing, British building really is something to shout about. ","June 9, 2019"
"An outstanding living cathedral, full of character, epitomising the spirit of England in prayer and located in the heart of the capital city, it is worth a visit either as a tourist or a local on a day out in the City.","June 9, 2019"
"Such an enjoyable afternoon, saw the bells being lifted after maintenance. Lots and lots of steps so not disability friendly. So much history. Friendly guides placed around the building. And so very beautiful. ","June 8, 2019"
You can’t help but get chills as you walk through St. Paul’s. The exterior does not even begin to do it justice! Looking up at the beautiful ceilings covered with millions of mosaic tiles glistening is like staring in to a sea of jewels - it is truly a masterpiece!,"June 8, 2019"
We took the guided tour. The building architecture and the history in this majestic church is touching. The weather was kind to us so it was nice to walk the grounds and climb up to the dome- though- warning: do not climb the dome if you are unfit like me!!! It’s claustrophobic and a better view can be seen on the London eye! ,"June 8, 2019"
"Stunning.Worth the visit. A piece of modern history, the architecture of the church both indoors and outside are extraordinary. One of the most beautiful cathedrals in the world.Walking inside, aside from the beautiful decor and history, the atmosphere is peaceful. Photos are allowed so bring a camera. You can easily spend an hour or even two here.. When you are done exploring the Cathedral and the crypt below, you can climb all the way up to the top for an incredible view. . A must see for any tourist. This is one of the best places you could visit in London.","June 8, 2019"
This is a beautiful church and worth the £20 entry fee. Take the audio tour and enjoy looking at the art on the walls and the ornate ceilings. Take a seat and enjoy the visual delight of this amazing church. The views up Dome are worth the 300+ steps and a few more hundred to the top level. Have a great time! ,"June 7, 2019"
"I have been to many Cathedrals around the world. In my opinion, by far, this was the best. I liked Westminster Abbey but enjoyed St Pauls much more. I caught myself actually say “wow” out loud once. It was a perfect day to go because it was raining so good day to be inside. I walked right up and was inside in 30 seconds. The audio guide was very nice. I am glad they allow pictures. I did the climb to the dome. About that...I’m fit, I hike and run a lot. So I wasn’t worried about the physical side of it. Yes, it is not for the weary but there were several senior citizens mailing the climb. There are places to stop occasionally to rest. However, half of the climb is on a monkey tail staircase that is a very tight turn and constant twist. So...if you are balance challenged or get vertigo, you may want to think twice about it. The view is all everyone says it is. I didn’t do the Shard tour because I knew I was going to get a great view of the city during this tour. I will say to make sure if you do the climb to stop at the galleries portion. I wasn’t paying attention and didn’t realize this was where you stop for it until I was back at the bottom and since I didn’t want to be a show off, I wasn’t about to climb it again (just kidding, I was too tired). I spent 3 hours here and could have easily spent another hour if I didn’t have other places to go. I would say the differences between St Pauls and Westminster Abbey are these...Longer wait at Westminster Abbey if you don’t book ahead of time. Westminster Abbey has more names would will recognize like Isaac Newton while St Pauls has a lot of military folks but they also recognize the whole group. I mean its great to recognize a general of field Marshall but being someone who has served, I know those guys are only as good as the little folks sacrificing and putting their lives on the line. St Pauls recognizes them. You can take pictures at St. Paul’s and not at the Abbey. It wasn’t as crowded at St Pauls so I didn’t feel like I had to keep moving or get out of peoples way. Don’t get me wrong, I liked them both and would rec both, but I like St. Paul’s better.","June 7, 2019"
I thought it’s expensive for the first timeIt's worth paying money for thatPlease be careful in closed time,"June 7, 2019"
"Being there for concerts and events and it has an excellent accoustic and seating space. You will also have the chance to admire Wren's skillful architecture and the various paintings (and tombs) around. Good for the family, or during your break if already in the City","June 7, 2019"
"Well up front, St Paul's Cathedral is one of those iconic landmarks - along with Westminster Abbey - that you have to visit when in London. Admission to St Paul's is 20 pounds per person which at first glance, begs the question, is it worth it? Taking the plunge, my wife and I paid the entry price and then opted for the short guided tour which in retrospect was entirely sufficient. After the guided tour (which was very good) we did our own thing. This comprised of taking the hundreds of steps to the upper external viewing gallery in the church (great viewing) and then going down to the basement crypt to view the monuments to some of the UK's great achievers (Duke of Wellington, etc). Highlights are the mosaic ceilings in the Cathedral, the upper dome viewing and the crypt. Recommended.","June 7, 2019"
We visited one afternoon and there was a service. We were pleasantly surprised when the boy's choir/chorale performed. ,"June 6, 2019"
"This is a great thing to do with teen age children, lots of climbing of stairs rewarded by great views. The whispering gallery is fun. The Catherdral itself is magnificent.","June 6, 2019"
"The building looks good from the outside but the inside is truly stunning, and so well presented. I understand peoples comments about the high charges to enter but having seen the condition of this Cathedral I do not mind contributing to its upkeep. The audio system, although not as good as the Westminster Abbey one, helps you to navigate the tour at your own pace.There is something to see at every turn with mention of many famous people in our history. Christopher Wren was some architect!","June 6, 2019"
"The silhouette of St Paul's Cathedral represents a quintessential feature of London's skyline. Wren's architectural masterpiece marks the culmination of over 1400 years of there being a Cathedral on this site. A ""must visit"" destination for anyone travelling to London.","June 6, 2019"
"There is an amazing amount to see in this historic church. You could easily spend several hours if you wanted to. The main floor is huge with lots of artistic details. Definitely take one of the audiotour guides to see things at your own pace. There can be lines to get in so our London Pass allowed us to enter quickly without a line. Also go to the basement to see all the tombs of famous people (Lawrence of Arabia, Florence Nightingale). We loved the modern sculptures in honor of the people and buildings destroyed in the two world wars within the historic ceilings and walls.","June 5, 2019"
The truth is that I was a little disappointed. I expected more because it is so famous.What was more disappointing is that they charge an entrance fee of 20 Pound. I never paid to enter in cathedral - and sow many.,"June 5, 2019"
"Had the pleasure of going to evening song in St. Paul's Cathedral, it is a wonderful place to sit and reflect.","June 5, 2019"
The church is wonderful but the view from the dome is worth all 528 steps. Went to a few services and it’s quite special. The history and the beauty of these old buildings can’t be replicated ,"June 5, 2019"
"Another don't miss sight in London. If you're able, I highly recommend climbing the 550 steps to go to the top of the cathedral dome and look out over London. The views are great from up there but you must climb the steps. There is no lift for assistance. And of course the church itself is amazing with the kings and nobility tombs. Definitely pick up the audio guide so you know what you're looking at.","June 5, 2019"
"We visited St Paul's Cathedral expecting it to be like all the other churches and cathedrals throughout Europe, but we were definitely wrong. We had a wonderful time at St Paul's Cathedral which began with extremely friendly and helpful staff. The church was absolutely breathtaking and we were able to climb to the top of the dome for views over London as well as visit the tombs underneath the Cathedral. At the entry, we were given audioguides which were incredibly informative and provided plenty of history on the cathedral. As we went to the cathedral as it opened we were fortunate to have few other people exploring the cathedral at the same time, and would definitely recommend this. St Paul's was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.","June 4, 2019"
This cathedral is just breath takingSimply no wordsThe crypt is just stunning.I had no idea the beautiful tributes within the walls.Worth every penny of the enter fee.Staff all very knowledgeable.A must must must.Nearest tube is st Paul'sYou can book online for a discount,"June 4, 2019"
"I spent a good three hours here. I prebooked a ticket to save £3, and also a little queueing as it turned out. There are regular guided tours as well as the usual audio guided self tour. There is a quick half hour one, a ninety minute ground floor and crypt tour and one of the Triforium, which I’m not familiar with. Before the 90 minute tour, I had time to get up to both the Stone and Golden galleries, which are 376 and 528 steps up respectively. Not easy to do but well worth it. Then it was back down for the tour which was excellent. Not too much info overload and also time afterwards to fill in detail in areas suggested by our guide, Nora. Well worth the time! ","June 4, 2019"
"As an Episcopalian, I am a member of the Anglican Church so this is my ""Mother Church"" (according to my priest). I thought it was beautiful and enjoyed recieving communion there. A climb to the top is nice although if you are claustophobic you should avoid this part of the tour. I'd say this church is on my ""A"" list to visit.","June 4, 2019"
"Sir Christopher Wren's masterpiece that survived the blitz. The grounds are beautiful and the architecture amazing. A £20 admission charge and bag search a necessity of modern times. Did not make the trip to the rotunda for the view, but it is supposed to be spectacular. ","June 4, 2019"
"Visiting as an American, there are several components here that reflect the American soldiers lost in World War II. The history of this incredible cathedral will impress you. They don’t allow photo taking so I didn’t, however many others were taking photos. If you were in London for the first time, I would recommend visiting.","June 4, 2019"
I have started to dodge Church's but I'm so glad this was included in our Day London Tour. Having a FABULOUS tour guide made all the difference and we were able to put the place in its historical context. Great visit.,"June 4, 2019"
"This is a lovely Cathedral inside and out. You are not allowed to take photos inside at all, and this is strictly enforced. We were able to have a free-flowing tourist experience and not stand in a lot of lines or big crowds. We were fortunate enough to be in the area to attend a brief evening service featuring the choir - something I highly recommend as the acoustics are perfect for music. The crypt is a big part of the tour if that's your cup of tea. If you want to explore the higher points of the Cathedral there are lots of stairs. The gift shop was superb and had a wide variety of goods and pricepoints.","June 4, 2019"
Last time we were here St Paul’s looked like parliament all covered in scaffolding and tarps. What a great spectacular renovation yep they should be very proud this is a beautiful church,"June 3, 2019"
"We were in London and thought we would visit St Paul’s Cathedral, on viewing the admission charges decided against it, plus the whispering gallery was closed which was what we really wanted to see.","June 3, 2019"
The architecture is grand. Not to be missed is the American Chapel where a book with the names of all the Americans who died in the war is kept and a page is turned daily. Just reading about all who sacrificed during WWI and II makes it a very moving experience.,"June 3, 2019"
"Last time I went the top was closed to tourists... if that's the case I'd give it a 3 star experience... you need to pay to see a lot of it, which I'm not sure if worth it. But if you can go to the top, it's worth the fee and the time. Call ahead to check.","June 3, 2019"
Only downside is that you cannot take pictures inside. It’s a stunning church with a lot of history to it. Every corner has something to look at in awe. Great little cafe as well for s coffee stop before leaving. But please respect the church by not taking photos.,"June 3, 2019"
"St. Paul's Cathedral is not to be missed. It is stunningly beautiful, in a reserved way, as you enter the narthex. Originally fairly austere (by Baroque standards), it was ornately decorated during the Victorian Period, when the tumult of the Reformation was largely over.Rather too much is made of Lord Nelson, who is buried there; it is after all, a church, not a museum. ","June 2, 2019"
"Unlike so many other buildings in London that are covered in scaffolding, St. Paul's did not have any construction, which was refreshing! It is a beautiful and warm building. I recommend using the headset for the self guided tour, but it was hard to follow which attraction was next.","June 2, 2019"
"I’ve visited this beautiful 17th Century Cathedral a few times over the last few years and, each time, I’ve learnt something more about its history. This time I learned that it was the first Cathedral to be built following the reformation.It was very busy when I visited but the interior is immense and there was space for everybody. Make sure you climb to the top for great views. A lot of steps but worth it!Entry was £17. Photography was not allowed.","June 2, 2019"
"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to St. Paul's Cathedral. It is quite large and there is a lot to see, so it's best to allow at least 2 hours. Climbing up to the dome gives some truly amazing views over London. The interior is gorgeous and it is vast enough to not seem too insanely crowded even though it probably is!","June 1, 2019"
"On a recent trip to London, we were able to attend Evensong on a Sunday afternoon. This classical Anglican service is sung by a 50 voice professional choir, accompanied by one of Europe's grandest organs, and performed in a Cathedral that is second only in size to St. Peter's in Rome. As a retired Anglican organist and choirmaster, I can honestly say that the music here was the finest liturgical music I have ever heard performed anywhere in the world.","June 1, 2019"
"Love it from the outside. Unbelievable on the inside. Over 500 steps to the galleries (get there early). No photos inside. Don't miss the crypt. Using a London Pass is economical. Loved it, super impressed ","June 1, 2019"
"St Paul’s Cathedral is an absolute must. A stunning building with a fascinating history. Staff were notably efficient and helpful, and the audio guide was brilliant. ","June 1, 2019"
"St. Paul's is absolutely impressive. There are just no other words to describe it. As an American, i found the chapel dedicated to the Americans particularly moving.","May 31, 2019"
"We visited St. Paul’s on a Thursday in mid-April. Jennie was our tour leader (1.5-hour tour), and she shared lots of interesting tidbits, and many of her strong and highly idiosyncratic opinions in that time. St. Paul’s is huge and we were there for only 2 hours. There is so much to see and only so much time. That said, we felt we got our money’s worth ($20 donation), and learned quite a bit along the way. This is a great place to visit, although we agreed amongst ourselves that it was less awe inspiring than Westminster Abbey, which we saw on the same day in the morning. There were many large student groups here the day we visited, and that affected our entry wait times significantly, even though we had pre-paid tickets. This is clearly a must-see sight, although if time is limited, we recommend choosing Westminster over St. Paul’s.","May 31, 2019"
"Wonderfull to see, great architecture and what an amazing view at the top!A must see if you visit London if you ask me.","May 31, 2019"
Amazing views and a great place to relax. I enjoy this place very much and can come back many times in the future. ,"May 30, 2019"
