That combination did not even scratch the surface of what was on offer.The smells, aromas, colours and flavors are irresistible!Miss this one and lose out! ||August 7, 2019
BSCone||50||What a wonderful market in the middle of the city! Plenty to see and buy. Great food. I would recommend not going on a Saturday in July, though. Madness! Shoot for a weekday.||August 7, 2019
MariaCon||50||You could not love the Borough market! It has this great London vibe which I love. The food is good but the restaurants around the area are also great. Explore the area by foot.||August 7, 2019
JWR||40||Borough Market is adjacent to London Bridge station and well worth a visit. Quite a few of the stalls will let you try their produce before you buy which is a great idea. There are also quite a few places to get brunch/lunch in the area whilst you are there.||August 7, 2019
aiazotti||50||if you are on a Southbank trip, this is a must-see place. you will definitely have good food. you can also do some shopping to cook at home.||August 7, 2019
nickk_marshall||50||As a local, I frequent to Borough market and can say that I never get bored of it. It’s a must for anyone with any interest in food; basically everyone! My personal favourite has got to be the Pad Thai stall located nearer Southwark Cathedral but all offer 5-star quality regardless. My advice is NOT to do one of the paid tours of the markets. They’re best seen on foot by yourself so you can take enough time to browse what you want.In terms of prices, it is quite expensive but that’s normal when considering it’s location.||August 7, 2019
begumandsteven||50||What a great place for all things food related! It really caters for everyone and there is some great produce here; my wife is a vegan and she would love it here. Great for food shopping or just looking around but some great places to eat and drink here!||August 7, 2019
Colin D||40||A nice market with some quirky stalls within it, though lots of the places are quite expensive for the products that they sell. Only to be expected though because of the closeness to London Bridge and the station.Plenty of places to get a takeaway snack or meal when on the move.Interesting architecture in terms of the roof and the entrances.||August 7, 2019
SharonHuckle||50||We love Borough market and was pleased to find they now have a full market from Wednesdays. We visited with my Daughter, Son in law and 2 Grandsons aged 4 & 6. Pre lunchtime the market was quiet so it was good to have a good look around. As lunchtime approached it got busier but the buzz and atmosphere were great. The boys loved the fish stalls and even tried Oysters for the first time. ( small ones were £1 so a bargain). We tried Paella, cheeses, balsamic vinegar and salami plus so much more on offer. We bought plenty and didn’t feel prices were too high. All stall holders were friendly and coupled with the atmosphere it filled a couple of hours before our trip to the Shard which is just around the corner.||August 6, 2019
D5958EMdavid||40||Foodie heaven, fantastic place, great atmosphere. Lots of nice places to eat from pubs to Roast restaurant. So many market stalls with fantastic products. Well worth a visit.||August 6, 2019
Yoki H||40||Fresh seafood, friendly vibe and huge market to explore. you can have lunch there as well as getting all sort of small gifts||August 6, 2019
434anamarias||50||It’s an old market , the oldest in London , where it’s possible to look at a lot of history , amazing history.If you imagine that’s just a market to buy some food you are wrong, there are a lot of spaces selling a wonderful food , Italian, Spanish, and from another countries., besides that you can find many stores sending many delicious products.Definitely it’s an unforgettable place .||August 6, 2019
Kraut69||50||The market was easy to find....follow the other foodies.It is definitely worth to get up early for the Saturday or Sunday Market.The market is buzzing with items ranging from Gin produced in London,to German Bratwurst and Sauerkraut to unusual Cheese and Spices.It is so easy to get lost between all the stalls.Sometimes you can be lucky ,some stall holders let you try before you buy.Do not go with an empty stomach,you want to buy everything.I liked that the market installed water fountains so you can fill up your water bottles.Definitely worth a visit for families and couples alike.||August 6, 2019
maureenp197||40||Well worth a visit if you like food and atmosphere. Found a nice pub ( can't remember the name), just off the market. Great atmosphere. ||August 6, 2019
don1903||50||visited the famous market on the way to the shard. well worth a visit. loads of food options from all corners of the globe. had a delightful curry and rice dish from one stall and washed it down with a sangria from another. well priced too, not a rip off unlike many other markets. would have loved to take some stuff home but couldn't unfortunately. definitely come back here when we visit London next. it can get very busy but service is speedy.||August 6, 2019
latieda79||50||Amazing, for all the senses and every kind of food! Fresh and prepared! Several restaurants are part of it as well.||August 6, 2019
vanlierop||50||Borough Market surpassed my expectations. This place is a food lovers paradise. From Ethiopian salty beef, to pizza, burgers, eastern bread, beverages, seafood. You name it the market has it. Bring with you a bottle of water or buy while you are walking some beverages. The market can be very crowded and with all the steamy kitchens you will soon find yourself sweating. ||August 6, 2019
kieraj468||40||The market is beautiful I’ve never seen anything like it, the smells were incredible, the street was very full but you could still move around easy enough.||August 6, 2019
Jerry L||30||Very interesting market on the southbank. You can find everything. Nice walk with gentle people. Morning is better.||August 5, 2019
20carolj||50||My favourite place whenever I visit London.This is the oldest food market in London dating back to 12 century.When you enter it is organised chaos the fresh food is beautifully displayed with tags on how to cook.There is Artisan food and fresh fish in a boat to gin tasting.The sounds of vendors calling out and the smells of food cooking from around the world lure you in.There are restaurants on site or you can buy to go.However seating is limited especially around lunch hour.There are demo kitchens where you can join in and interact.To get here I took the Jubilee line to the London bridge then walked along the river.||August 4, 2019
AlexWacla||50||If you like street markets, food and products from all over the world, this will be Disneyland for you. Noise, yes, Crowded, yes, Is located below train tracks, yes, smells food, yeeeeessss. Cheese, Fudge, Sweets, Fish, Sausages, Charcutaria, you name it. Go! I would live in this place.||August 4, 2019
Colleen M||40||We finished off our Muggles Walking Tour here and what a fabulous place. We so enjoyed walking around all the stalls, oohing an aahing at all the marvellous displays of fruit, veg, fish and meat.Unfortunately, we found the stalls too busy with long queues for the snacks/lunches so we had to find an alternative place to eat.||August 4, 2019
Charles19671||50||It’s a great place for lunch but be prepared for long lines and incredible congestion as it feels like the entire city comes here for lunch. Allows you to sample a variety of different items. ||August 3, 2019
Q4720GGsimonc||40||It was wonderful but so many people. Had delicious street food. Very nice place I didn't know about before. Worth the detour. ||August 2, 2019

Itay110211||50||Not that far from the Tower area, Borough Market offers many food options! Especially if you like truffle mushroom, you can find a lot of truffle flavored food here :)||August 1, 2019
JettyTraveler||50||I love this market. There are local food and it is cheaper than going to the restaurants. You can buy many stuff here such as food, wine, fresh meat etc. There are a lot of tourist going there. It is not hard to find this place. The most thing that people going there for is fresh oyster(quite cheap) and some local dishes. I recommend you guys to visit if you go to London. ||July 31, 2019
alinezacha||50||I went there on Monday morning , and was so impressive .plenty of place to see and discovery nice food e a real opportunity to enjoy fews of the bytes from London . In there you will find the best of : vegetables , SEA FOOD ,breads and much more .very nice place don’t miss this one ||July 31, 2019
Lola M||50||Went to wander around but unfortunately I just had a generous breakfast and was not hungry at all!!- The market has many different food options, cooked (and from different countries) or uncooked (vegetables, fruits, meat, seafood, etc )and all looked and smelled amazing. A must in London!||July 31, 2019
James L||50||On the mid 1980s I worked for several months just around the corner. The choice of takeaway food in the area ie London Bridge was limited to fish and chips and sandwiches. But now...blimey! The food here is not only excellent but very wide ranging. The trick is to wander around and check out the free samples before you finally choose...with a pin on a map maybe cos it will do your head in...what you really want to eat. This is when if you've made the mistake of eating that naughty (or any) breakfast, you'll regret not leaving room in your tummy for the yummies here. Foolish. Ideally go on a fast for a couple of days and choose several things to gorge on. What would I eat? All of it! And then fill a bag with bread and meat and cheese and pastries. But then I'm a pig when it comes to good food. Oh yeah, if you go with several friends or family members and you each buy something different then you could turn your collective nosh into a big sampling session. And there's plenty if pubs nearby to wash it down. The George across the road is London's last original galleried inn but you should only eat in the courtyard. They sell good food too. Enjoy.||July 31, 2019
ceegeeep||50||There is so much to eat here. Breads, fruit and veg. Amazing array of street foods, all in a wonderful atmosphere. Great place to explore||July 30, 2019

288barbaraj||50||Took my 2 nieces to celebrate 18th birthday. Nice space overlooking Borough Market. Excellent set lunch menu at £35. We chose asparagus with duck egg delicious. Pork belly with crispy crackling and sea bream all were excellent Puddings were cherry crumble. And sticky toffee pudding and Lemon Posset which had run out !! Service was attentive and nice cool air conditioning on a very hot day. The afternoon tea looked amazing||July 30, 2019
Lavarcham||30||It is such a vibrant colourful place with wonderful variety of foods stalls and cafes. Great to see it thriving again after such a violent interlude. ||July 29, 2019
laura j||10||Not the borough market of years ago. Went here as just part of a day in London, never again.Filthiest place I've been toSupposedly gourmet food, which in itself is hilarious..It was just disgusting .Filthy dirty, bluebottles and insects crawling over food, drips from overhead landing everywhere.Pans of seafood paella, simmering open to all, The funniest thing was, it was all like the emperor's new clothes, all mostly run by yuppies, and being bought by trendies who can go back and say how they bought this earthy fresh food from a london foodie market.Enter at your peril.||July 29, 2019
PaulK29||30||Gourmet food stalls as well as purveyors of specialty items. Layout is terrible leading to congested points with no way through. Possibly at another time of year, when there are fewer tourists, one might really enjoy this place. While the foods are delicious, you’ll likely have to stand and scarf down your food. Take away would make better sense. Worth a look while strolling the south bank but I would not make this a destination for scepter maybe at opening.||July 28, 2019
Rita S||40||We spent a Saturday morning here walking around and checking out the yummy local food. We ate as we walked around the market and enjoyed the local vendor's great bread, cheese, meat and olives. We planned to get some items for a park lunch but since we didn't have a knife along and all the cheese and meats were sold in blocks we just ate as we went. Fun way to spend some time after spending so much time in museums, churches, etc.||July 28, 2019
292FionaS||40||My favourite market, a great atmosphere with some amazing produce. It’s a shame I’m always on a weekend break with limited chilling resources to buy things to take home. Lunch and snacks are compulsory though! Next time I’m trying the champagne and oysters! ||July 28, 2019
catinthehat336||50||We came to this stop on a food tour, the guide commented it gets a bit touristy..ha, esp since your bring tours here? Either way people will find it! There is everything you can imagine here. Flowers, breads, jams, meats-fresh & preserved, food to eat, food to take with, gifts, snacks-it’ll keep you busy, and buying! Definitely find Rosebuds preserves-so many choices (free tastes) and if you purchase 3, he’ll put it in a gift box for you (you’ll want more than 3!) Canon & Canon charcuterie (venison sausage awesome), Comptoir gormand has the biggest meringues you’ve ever seen, Traditional Baltic treats has just that, delicious things you can’t find just anywhere, Fromage Charcuterie has a selection that will blow your mind, delicious fresh & preserves meats, cheeses-I can’t name them all, get in there and wander about and support local small business and entrepreneurs.||July 28, 2019
psychprofessor||40||My wife and I were looking for food for our lunch when we walked through Borough Market. We got three kinds of bread: mini croissants, round balls covered in powdered sugar that had an almond flavor, and a skinny loaf with olives and cheese. The round balls were so good that we went back and bought some more to have for dessert that night. My wife bought a Pim's drink, and we split some paella with chicken, fish, and chorizo. I didn't eat the chorizo and what appeared to be a chicken gizzard. I thought the paella was very bland. My advice: Taste as many samples as possible before deciding on what to buy. Very interesting market.||July 27, 2019
DominiLdn||40||Cool market near London Bridge station - however, is getting very touristy. Lots of restaurants, bars nearby to eat. Any fresh product you can think of, will be there.||July 27, 2019

Mike D||50||I was totally blown away by this place. The food available is on another level. I really enjoyed trying out several stalls. Really impressed. I would say the food is expensive but very tasty. A great idea to visit by our teenage son and we had a great time. Highly recommend but take plenty of cash and be prepared to eat much more than you normally would ||July 27, 2019

RH0s||50||Located on London's low key BEST SIDE - Southbank - the Borough Market is right off the London Bridge tube station and is a fun stroll for people watching and food sampling. The market might not be as fancy as other London markets, but Borough has been around long enough to have been sacked by Vikings. It's great for fresh baked goods, all sorts of ethnic cuisines (including cauldrons of paella), and taking colorful photos among organic fruits and vegetables in a monochrome neon orange look (see attached photo).||July 24, 2019
davids300382||50||First experience of the busy market and loved it. Brilliant food and one of the best places for oysters so it's a must visit when in London.||July 24, 2019
Jim L||50||Thrilling time to experience an international market. Bring your appetite so that you can sample a variety of food and fresh produce from a variety of origins!||July 23, 2019
devilsdr||50||Borough is most famous food market in UK, probably the world. I have been to a lot of food streets and markets all over but what makes Borough distinct and superior is the ambience and feeling. Though always heavily crowded with tourists and locals, the market never feels noisy or packed. The way its run and updated, the British touch prevails but still there are enough places to sit and adequate space to move.Borough Market is located right in heart of London, right in front of London Bridge train and tube station. The market is hybrid of shops and food stalls. The versatility is unbeatable here as you can get variety of truffles, cheese, sea food and baked stuff from all over the world. The food area is huge and nearly all cuisines are covered in shops and stalls. In mood for English Breakfast or Scottish Eggs, Salt beef or German Bratwurst, Indian or Asian, Ethiopian or French, all cuisines are covered and at very affordable price if you compare to rest of London.It needs a more elaborate review to mention all specialties and delicacies you find at Borough, it's better you explore yourself, dig in, definitely you will find a favorite of your own at this wonderful place. ||July 20, 2019
jjw1969||40||I love going to the Borough Market each time I come to London. It’s a great place to sample all sorts of food and stroll by the various food stalls. However, for a place that is known for fresh, authentic and organic food, the widespread use of plastic cups, cutlery and packaging is shocking. Somebody needs to wake up and do something about this!||July 19, 2019
T0urist7||50||Borough Market is an open air market. A few steps down from London bridge. Market certainly is pretty cool for shopping and you can also visit the excellent restaurants. I find it interesting why Brough Market is on the top of the list of London tourist attractions. In the category of the open air markets, in my opinion, Brixton Market is much more attractive and Camden Market is bigger and prices are significantly lower there. In the food-hall category, the unparalleled leader and the most attractive place is the food-hall in Harrods. Being in the vicinity of London Bridge is worth spending a few minutes shopping and then choose a restaurant or a pub for lunch or beer.||July 19, 2019
just4nick||40||The market is great but sadly, it's overcrowded.Otherwise there are a lot of food options - German, Croatian, Indian, Thai, Ethiopian, Spanish just to name a few (there are a lot more)||July 19, 2019
FredYin||50||Plenty of food choices, from seafood to wild game to cheese and wine. There will be some walking involved too as you explore this vibrant market place.||July 19, 2019
175olafm||50||The Borough Market is next to the London Bridge at the opposite side of the City of London. This is a good market with a lot of ethnic street food restaurants.You can find there any kind of fish, meat or vegetarian food. Everything is freshly cooked and most of the food tastes great.I go there each time when I visit London.Today I have eaten chicken laksa with rice for 7£, a fresh pressed berry juice for 3,5£.The food is not cheap but there is a great atmosphere and the quality is mostly outstanding.My favorite place in London.||July 18, 2019
trixie1957||50||What an amazing market, you can buy anything here. Very large and exciting. They have everything you could ever want from food to gifts to holiday items. Take the time to go you won't be disappointed ||July 18, 2019
rodolfop246||50||Fantastic and large food hall in an industrial setting, with lots of choices and some really great food available. Buy your bread from one place, your oh-my-God-good Parmesan from the French lady just left of the entrance, and your Parma ham from someone else, or go straight to the fresh oysters and today's catch in the back. I suggest you bring a pocketknife if you're planning to eat your things here, as the bread shops are mostly not allowed to slice their bread.But please note: there's no place to sit. The space is all dedicated to having as many shops as possible selling food (a good thing) so they've left no space for tables or chairs. While I can wish they had both, in the end it is what it is, so bring comfortable shoes because you'll be standing the entire time.||July 18, 2019
JackTheDog1||50||All kinds happening here and tons to see and eat! If everyone in your party can’t find something to suit their taste, something is wrong!Food vendors, cheese, coffee, dry goods etc. Lots to see here. It’s definitely a busy spot and very little seating, but we spent a couple hours roaming around and having a bite to eat. Worth a visit!||July 17, 2019
516edwardc||50||Had an amazing afternoon at the market. Wright brothers seafood was amazing and made a ton of friends during our visit. ||July 17, 2019
wren76||50||Everyone must pay this place a visit, live music, sunshine and the choice of every food you can imagine. We picked Ethiopian which was delicious and sat listening to a local busker which was dead relaxing... a MUST DO!! ||July 17, 2019
eimimathetes||50||Borough Market holds a multitude of delights if you love good food. A wide variety of prepared meals awaits, along with fresh ingredients, and a shop with kitchen tools and gadgets. Dining there is a wonderful experience, and when I have the opportunity to visit London, I head to Borough Market for the best mustard I’ve ever had (from Fitz). Whatever your food passion, Borough Market is the place to indulge yourself. ||July 16, 2019
Cazziii||50||This market had everything you want. A great place to get lunch with every type of food you could imagine and also delis and other items.||July 16, 2019
ATBrighton||50||Such a shame every type of food and all seems freshly cooked or fresh food to buy. There are no seats to rest while you eat, such a shame.||July 16, 2019

Boudin882||50||Visiting on a Saturday morning, this Victorian building still has a period feel, with the numerous food stalls open to the shopper and casual browser The cast iron ceiling is reminiscent of markets in the big Australian cities,but the clattering of trains overhead adds to the quirky charm of the market.Those wanting seats could easily drop into the cafes dotted nearby.||July 15, 2019
nagled||30||So there's a great variety of good looking, and smelling, food to eat...but no seating that I saw. I read that it can get crowded and that prices are expensive. About a quarter of the stalls are for locals doing shopping (veggies, meat, fish, etc.). It's nice but i'd only recommend it if you are very close nearby anyway as I was. And come when you are hungry! I got there between meals, at 11 am, so had just a danish, a donut and a drink. I enjoyed Camden Market more.||July 15, 2019
harryd63||50||This is more than just a farmers market selling hipster cheeses, meats and veg. The selection of produce is amazing and you can find almost anything here.We loved the selection of veg, bread and cheeses and you can taste before you buy.Be aware it does get busy and at times it is pedestrian grid lock but that adds to the attraction of the place.There are plenty of places to experience delicious street foods the hardest part being making the choice of what to eat.Most definitely worth a visit at a weekend even if it is only to look at all the varied colourful stalls.||July 15, 2019
X2513MRstephenb||30||Really used to love this Market where the diversity in its food range was fantastic. Nowadays it seems to be full of cheese and artisan bread stalls. Still love the spice shop, don’t think you’ll ever get better but come on, let’s have some variety. ||July 14, 2019
EclecticLife||40||Lots of variety here of food and drinks.Nice samples too of tasty food!Can get very busy but it is what it is really. Great for a lunch or to pick up some food to have down by the river!Be careful of the cobbles and dodgy flooring as you can end up with a twisted ankle.||July 14, 2019
Tony S||50||You can wander around at your own pace, sample a vast array of food, and just sit and relax with a drink if you need to. Selection is enormous, especially of good ethnic food and traditional British cheeses. Not every stand has great stuff, but enough do to make it worth a visit.||July 14, 2019
Sunil P||50||There is vast array of ffods from all round the world aswll as drinks, or you can just sit in the bars and watch life pass by, just to cool||July 13, 2019
ohsuzyq10||50||London’s Borough Market is a great way to spend a few hours away from all the usual tourist-y places – and it’s FREE. We arrived in London mid-morning on a four day visit and were looking for something that would be enjoyable to do before throwing ourselves into the tourist fray. The market fit the bill with its delightful collage of booths selling cheeses, cookies, flowers, meats, olive oil, jams and jellies, and so much more. Samples are plentiful and we spend two or three hours tasting the offerings as we roamed through the many booths. We purchased our lunch at a booth – bowls of spicy chicken paella – and retreated to tiered seating outside. Lunch over, we visited the pastry booth with its mouth-watering goodies and the fresh lemonade stand to finish off the impromptu meal. We thoroughly enjoyed the Borough Market which is easy to access via the Underground. It was a fun, unhurried (and free!) way to start our time in London. I highly recommend it.||July 13, 2019
ChrisH468975||40||Lovely to mooch round and get great ingredients as well as eating some tasty stret food. Realy busy great fun.||July 13, 2019
achunder||50||Have not been here before; it’s an open air market few steps down from London bridge and there is plenty happening here. You can buy fresh veggies and meat and cheese like farmers market, you can hang out and taste different options of food here or you have coffee/dessert options here.....plenty of them and more. I happened to try something new called “Raclette” which is a Swiss style potato served with melted cheese and sprinkled with paprika and pepper with mini pickles. At first, it did not sound too good but it does taste good and I would recommend giving it a shot....||July 12, 2019

BrazilACA||50||Came here just after lunch and in 5 mns I was ready to eat again. Incredible place, with many, many diferent food stands, ne more tasty than the other. Very busy, the clhallenge is finding a place to seat and eat, but defenitely worth the visit!||July 12, 2019
311queenj||40||Borough Market is a food market with vendors selling packaged goods (like artisan cheeses) and various dishes cooked at the stalls. Stop by and sample foods from different stalls. I ate a delicious meat pie and then a salt pork sandwich. I sampled many other foods along the way. I'm not a big fan of paella, but the paella I sampled there was SO delicious, I would've bought some if I hadn't already stuffed myself with enough food for THREE meals. Plan to spend a few hours here because this market is much bigger than it seems and is VERY CROWDED. You will need to fight your way through the crowds to browse the stalls. And you will wait in lines at every stall, but it's so, soooooooo worth it. I had planned to spend about 1.5 hours here, but ended up spending about 2.5 hours here. Definitely decide on a meeting place should family members or friends get lost in the crowd. Maybe invest in a few leashes for the kids before venturing in . . . This outdoor food market is located near the London Bridge, between the Southwark Cathedral and The Shard. If you visit the London Tower and the Tower Bridge, the Borough Market is about a 15 minute walk away. While some vendors only took plastic, others accepted only cash, but at least half of the vendors seemed to accept either. The meat pie vendor only accepts credit and debit cards, a fact I did not discover until I reached the front of the line and was bewildered when he would not take my money. I didn't have my credit card on me and my disappointment was written so pathetically across my face, a stranger took pity on me and paid for my meat pie with his credit card and let me pay him back with the cash I was still clutching in my fist. He said he just couldn't let me miss out on something so good. (I think he just didn't want to see me cry over a missed meat pie opportunity.) Kind Stranger was so right! Oh, my Lord of Food! It's probably a good thing I DIDN'T have my credit card because I would have ended up buying about 10 pies - one of each kind. No. More like 8. I don't think I'd have ordered the kidney pie or the liver and onion pie. Step outside the tourist restaurants and, step into this food market! Forget fish and chips! Reject rigatoni! Cast aside kabobs! Pass on pizza! Come to the market to savor salt pork and polish off pot pies! Bring your cash, your plastic, and most of all, your appetite!||July 12, 2019
Andy P||50||We didn't give ourselves nearly enough time here. Perhaps, breakfast, lunch and dinner in one day might be considered gluttony but there is so much fantastic food here for every possible palate you might need two days even!And you have to try the Donuts! we'd died and gone to foodie heaven!||July 11, 2019
Trience4178||50||What's there not to love at Borough Market?!? Great food, lovely smells, great sights, awesome atmosphere. It's become one of our "must go to" each time we are in London! A must visit for anyone going to London for a visit. What I wouldn't give for Cardiff to have such an awesome market.||July 11, 2019
531ysabels||50||This is a must see. If your a foodie, you’ll be in heaven! Ate some amazing food here and there is a lot to see. Personal favourite was the Mac & cheese with pulled pork! ||July 11, 2019
karlabarkley||50||We did The Secret food tour and had a great guide! Ate plenty of food, from English sausage rolls, award winning fish and chips, mead and of course the secret food!! Everything was delicious and we really enjoyed it. One of our highlights in London||July 10, 2019
BenBMD||50||Unfortunately we did not have enough time to spend more at the market. Such interesting artisans with beautiful works. The food area was also varied and you could find anything you like there. A nice experience that should not be missed.||July 10, 2019
Jay3334||50||A great farmers market with so many choices for top notch food and wine. We enjoyed so many local cheeses, sparkling wine, clams and oysters, and of course some Scotch Eggs, a most for local flair.||July 10, 2019
Ryan5483||50||Tons of vendors and tons of good food and homemade goodies! We’ve gone a few times and have gotten amazing food every time. ||July 10, 2019
Pdonatyandkids||50||This was on our list to see and the first time we came across the market was about 6 o’clock at night. Plenty of vendors and not very crowded. A little overwhelming on deciding where to go and what to see. We returned a little later in our trip to have lunch from the vendors. It was very crowded. As we had an 80 year old in our party, I was especially worried about keeping her safe. It was so crowded at certain points that you were on top of the person in front of you as you tried to move around the market. We brought food from one of the street vendor who was making chicken pad Thai. The portions were big, and you had the experience of seeing it made in front of you while you waited in line. Price was perfect. We waited in line for 15 minutes during lunch time. The main problem was after you received your food was finding a spot to sit and eat...never mind the fact carrying your food with out it dropping through all the people who were also in the market. Well, worth the experience. We would return but not during lunch time.||July 9, 2019
msaluja||50||This is a must see .. go hungry !!There are tons of vendors and you can buy fresh bread, meats, cheeses, fruits/veggies. There is prepared food also freshly made to eat.. paella, fish and chips, Indian street food (chat, dosa). Can get fresh fruit/veggie juices with no added sugar! Tons of bakery goods.. tarts, donuts, etc.||July 9, 2019
fearlessbob||40||Spent a couple of hours here, savouring the sights and smells of this very busy market. Ended up buying the dinner ingredients here (fresh scallops and assorted stuff for a delicious ceviche that night).||July 8, 2019
georgiascanlon||50||The variety of food here is huge! An oyster bar, juice bar, burgers, the list goes on I recommend the Mac and cheese just on one of the corners of the market, The Mac and cheese with pulled pork is delicious! And the donut stall-honeycomb donuts to die for ||July 8, 2019
salthound||40||Decided to visit Borough Market at lunchtime as I had never experienced it before. It is a truly wonderful place to visit. Many types of food are one offer from French cheeses all the way through to Thai noodles. Of particular note for me were the oysters - very large and very delicious and the fresh fruit - some cherries to die for. Will certainly revisit when in the area.||July 8, 2019
John C||40||The Market is really worth a visit as there are numerous sights and smells from the various stalls and they are create a fantastic atmosphere. Yes, there are large numbers of visitors however this adds to the atmosphere, just be aware that there will be lots of people and relax and enjoy.||July 8, 2019
Broadhurst||50||We arrived at the market around 10:00, it was just opening up and not too crowded, we had seen that later in the day it gets very busy. There is a lot to see, and try. Most of the shall holders a very friendly and want you to try their produce, I had a chilli sauce tasting! Great place to spend an hour.||July 7, 2019
tonystastytours||40||Borough Market has been dubbed a foodies market and for obvious reasons. This market idea literally located under the London Bridge and is filled with food stalls. Like with all food stalls, some are great and some, not so much. A pro tip, don't go when it's almost closing. You'll get the leftovers and be rushed out. I personally enjoyed the fish and chips stall. I also enjoyed the paella and laksa from the fish market. But stay away from the raw bar at the fish market. I ordered several sea urchins (uni) from Spain and they were awful. I wanted to throw up after eating them because it tasted like gasoline. The place is crowded and does have great gems. Most stalls take credit cards but I suggest going early to beat the crowds. ||July 7, 2019
Bowenite||40||Borough market about 15minutes from Lalit Hotel. Had breakfast there an. Such an array of foods to buy and eat.||July 6, 2019
JBDsturdy||50||This was the first visit for my wife - but she loved it. We have visited other markets around the world - including La Boca in Barcelona - but this must be one of the best - and most fun that there is.Yes it is crowded - but that's what keeps it alive!Incredible diversity in food and food types.Don't miss it!||July 6, 2019
Jgifas||50||We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon- it’s closed sundays. But vowed to come back. We went the next day for lunch. One son got a pulled pork wrap and my other son got the fresh pasta. We purchased huge white chocolate cookies. It was great. We leaned against a wall to eat. It was fine. Bathrooms had a line but still fine. We returned the next day - kids got same things. Husband gotPizza and I got a German sausage. More cookies too! My cousin didn’t like it because it is not a sit down place. This is where you go to grab on the go eats. Bread and cheese. Sausage. I did buy jam but they took it at the airport because you can’t check it. Next time I would do a tour. And I want to try that venison burger. The only problem we had was finding drinks but we managed. Can’t wait to go back. ||July 6, 2019
freedom1458||50||This place is a must visit for the foodie . A warning don’t eat before you go ..lots of tastings here. The food is amazing , it’s so hard to choose what to have for lunch we shared the amazing & famous toasted cheese sandwich from Kappacasein Dairy , this was soooo very rich ...I doubt you could eat a whole one .and shared a dozen oysters yum ||July 6, 2019
jessmurphy99||50||We just adored walking through here- it's so alive with people, flavours, and atmosphere. You can try paella, buy lemonade, marvel at massive meringues, or even just sit and enjoy everything that's going on around you. Really recommend coming here on an empty stomach- it won't be empty once you've left!||July 6, 2019
danwalluk||50||Spent an eye opening couple of hours wandering this foodie paradise! A gourmets dream as every stall offers fabulous produce from all corners of the globe. The smells you encounter as you journey through the arches is worth the trip alone.||July 6, 2019
booj15Nireland||50||Market buzzing with such a wide variety of food and drink. Great spot to munch and people watch. Wide variety will suit everyone in your group.||July 5, 2019
1954giants||50||A foodie's heaven! Everything from cheeses, fruit, veggies, meats, seafood, pastries, desserts and the diversity of choices goes on and on. We were here in 2017 and couldn't wait to return. I had an excellent meat pie at Pie Minister and my wife had Indian Dosa from Horn Ok Please which she said was delicious. Before leaving the market, we purchased some Venison, Wild Boar and Original Sausage from the Alpine Deli booth, all of which were great.If we lived in London, I know we would be frequent visitors to this wonderful market||July 5, 2019
Scottieboyuk||40||This has everything, food, food and more food! Champagne and strawberries, its great, you really do get a sense of the market here, people everywhere.But mostly it's good fun to visit and you leave being well fed and lots of stuff to choose from, something for everyone!||July 5, 2019

Boomerfoodie54||50||Excellent choice if you are looking for an open-air market. Olives, cheeses, meats, fresh fruit and veggies, restaurants, nuts, spices, condiments, goods, etc. ||July 4, 2019
VacaJill||50||One hundred plus food booths or prepared foods, fruits and cheeses. Lots of energy. Walk the entire market before you choose as there is an abundance of variety. We enjoyed Thai food and sweets and took away amazing cheeses and fruits. Fun outing, Run, walk, bike there ... no cabbing it as you will want to burn calories before and after visiting the market!||July 4, 2019
rockobello||40||This is a meca for food. We were having a hard time choosing what to eat but all is good. You cannot go wrong. Enjoy this little break and eat street food type grub for a change.||July 3, 2019
Thomasero||50||Fantastic selection of the great food at one place. During 2 visits (Sunday and Monday with its limited operation) we tried fresh bakery, paella with chorizo, Katalan stew, mussels, raspberry-chocolate ice cream and our clear winner - shredded duck with greens and onion confit from Le Marche du Quartier. ||July 3, 2019
Mrs R||50||One on the better place to go for seafood, very freshly prepared everything is delivered delicious and fresh on your plate. A bit pricey but good quality for what you pay for.||July 3, 2019
jpt2008||50||If you love trying different foods, highly recommend this place. If you are vegan or vegetarian, you should make a stop here. So many different cuisines to try and explore. It’s near London Bridge so you can do sightseeing and get some great food. Some of our favorites here were the dosa stand (Horn OK please); the Ethiopian place; Balkan pastries; the fresh pasta; bread ahead (can’t remember exact name but yummy filled donuts and fresh bread); and the coffee place that trains homeless people. (Don’t worry, even the kids will find something to eat!)||July 2, 2019
donaldy633||40||First time on south side of Thames. Good location for fish and diverse food stalls. A bit crowded during lunch. good location near financial district||July 2, 2019
DahlD||50||Nothing but food so go at lunchtime and don’t eat breakfast..... trust me. The amazing selection is huge and rivals any market I’ve been too. My fav was the mushroom stand. Cooked in butter with rosemary on toast. Delicious for £7. Easy to get too via the Tube with London Bridge station only 50m away.||July 2, 2019
Sharon B||50||This is THE best place to try great food from around the world. Everything from Pad Thai to Paella to Pie and Mash! Something for everyone and if you want to learn some culinary skills for yourself there are classes available in butchery and bread making, fabulous! Always something new to see and eat.||July 2, 2019
Clivey57||50||Came here to eat from the shard.been here a few years ago as you walk around each stall/ place all cooking various of dishes from sea food to meat to vegetables the smells are amazing you have to come here for lunch there’s shops, pub and bakery and at the bakery you can try baking yourself.||July 1, 2019
X7542XZkevinv||40||Wonderful meandering while nibbling on delicious delectables offered up by the vendors. Personal favorites were the fresh oysters, Comte cheese, and sausages! Special shout-out to the Oysterman! (Pic)||June 30, 2019
E5777KTmarkc||50||A wonderful place if you like food and good eating. Only time for a quick lunch this time so we tried Bloom at the edge of the market, Delicious, good portion and reasonable prices, what's not to love. Plenty of other choices around and in the market and always good. Looking forward to our next visit already.||June 30, 2019
juliaandadam123||50||Having never visited here our friends took us here. We were in awe. The sites, sounds and smells are amazing and that’s before you get to sample pretty much everything and send your tastes buds to heaven!There is more cheese and meat than anywhere else in London and it is all such high quality at good prices. We also sat outside and hand lunch and cocktails here. I can honestly say it was the best burger and chips I’d ever had in my life! My tastes buds loved every second! I can’t wait to take my husband and daughter on our next day to London. ||June 29, 2019
foodiefromlondon19||50||You name it, they've got it. I have been here for lunch numerous times in both summer and winter. The food and drink there is outstanding. It's all fresh and there are plenty of samples to try. There's fish and chips, french cheeses, Asian cuisine, roasts, vegan items, giant paella to live lobsters!! I love this place, sure it's a little pricey but its well worth it.||June 29, 2019
memee08||40||Lovely range of produce including cheeses, breads fruit, pate etc. Very busy on a Saturday lunchtime but plenty of lunch options available - they even had a water fountain to fill your bottle which was perfect for our 35 degree day.||June 29, 2019
iyyar||50||This was my second time visiting this market and it's always a pleasure! Great and fresh food, clean and full of good vibes!||June 29, 2019
Helen O||50||This market electrified your senses! The visual displays of food - seek out the mushroom se!ler, cheese displays and flower stalls, the street food - massive paella dishes bubbling away and piping hot or the fresh fish counters - complete with octopus and lobsters are a visual delight. Topped off by local chat, sellers calling out to entice customers it truly is a treasure. Whether you have 5 minutes or 5 hours it is worth making a journey to this part of London which has remained remarkably unspoilt considering where it is||June 29, 2019
Frankienorman||50||Visited yesterday and was super impressed. There was a huge choice of produce available to buy and reasonably priced. You can easily spend a few hours here looking and trying loads of various food and drink. Even though busy still didn’t have to queue too long and a really nice atmosphere. A must visit when In london but go hungry! ||June 28, 2019
692ew||50||This was my second time at the market in as many visits to London. On a warm summer Tuesday afternoon, the stalls were hopping and everyone was eating something. Wether in the heart if the market or the restaurant stalls on the outskirts, you’re senses will run wild. ||June 28, 2019
CompJax||50||What a joy to spend some time in the market on a weekday morning in June. The displays were wonderful - you just don't get the same sort of displays nowadays even in the big supermarkets.The cheeses, meats, fish, spices, oils, fruit and veg - what an array. The stallholders seemed to take much pride in their goods and there was plenty of interest in the produce from visitors. Lovely options too for snacks, meals, drinks. A great way to spend a few hours.||June 28, 2019
K_R_2466||50||An abundance of food to choose from, whether from stalls or the many restaurants in and around the market. There is something for everybody here. There are plenty of stalls selling produce so it is great to wander shop and eat but also buy produce to take home. Great quality food & produce and a lovely way to spend an afternoon.||June 27, 2019
Finnies32||40||Not somewhere on our itinerary but a very pleasant unexpected surprise. We ended up here from a Harry Potter walking tour and it was a great place to recharge. Very quaint. Very london||June 26, 2019
hannahkatherina||40||The market has a huge variety of food to try. There's also a great selection of fresh produce, meat and cheeses to buy. Bread Ahead was a standout. The cinnamon roll, in particular, was delicious. Be aware that the place is very crowded and it might be hard to find a seat. During my visit, it was pouring rain and there was still plenty of people. For the best experience, I would aim to go when the weather is good, as some of the stalls are not under cover.||June 26, 2019
Rick G||40||We were two families from Texas spending 2 weeks on a European vacation, visiting London, Paris and Barcelona European 14 Day trip from Texas. We had spent months planning this trip, to get the best bang for our bucks and see as many sites as possible. Wish we would have timed visiting here a little better. This is definitely a place to eat, snack and try different foods. Try and plan visiting here to eat. I believe the Tower of London is not to far away and Boroughs Market would be a great place to have interesting experience trying a lot of different cuisines . So much to choose from including small portions to a full meal.||June 25, 2019
kam l||40||The Market has so much to see and offer. You just had to inch your way through the crowd of people. We did enjoy a pulled pork sandwich. The fish and chips were not that great though advertised as being the best. We did get into a queue for gelato and was not disappointed.||June 25, 2019
Cindy W||40||A walk over the London bridge and to the right is Borough Market. Strolling along past all the local vendors hard at work creating their signature dishes. One can watch a large pot of Mac & Cheese be made from scratch right in front of you. Further along are the "soul" food vendors. You can experience diverse foods from all parts of world such as Ethiopia, the Carribbean, Portugal, Thailand, German, etc. that are cooked on huge paella pans over a gas flame. Good time to try something you might never have a chance to do again. A great place to buy fresh produce, meat, cheeses, and baked goods. Great for snacks later on. There are artisans waiting to sell you their goods as you stroll along.||June 25, 2019
Chrissie77||40||It would have been so much more pleasant! There is such a variety of food which looked wonderful but difficult to get to. We did buy some dosa which were superb, and perhaps next time we can visit on another day.||June 25, 2019
Mavrakaki||50||What a great market! Great variety of fresh fruit and vegetables and an incredible variety of street food to choose from! Make sure you don’t eat anything before you visit it because you will want to eat everything! Too bad I didn’t have much time to stay and eat more... fantastic place! I wil come back!||June 25, 2019
KKM2000||50||We learned about Borough Market through Vlogs. We are so glad we visited and planned on going hungry. There is such diversity of quality foods. If you were staying close by, it would be lovely to shop for your home meals. Check the website for hours. We arrived just as the market was opening at 10am and started sampling.||June 24, 2019
AzDEAT||50||Oodles of food and beverages stands of every imaginable type. First was the curry - so terrific; then the noodles - yum; then a German sausage - mouthwatering; then a PB&J sweet bar - heavenly. If only it was closer to home!||June 24, 2019
FarAway547784||50||Borough Market is one of the most important food markets in London. Approaching from London Bridge it seems a little bit hidden but it is an amazing place. Crowded with the food courts offering different types of cuisine it is worth a visit. I was kinda disappointed that we didn't have the time to see the whole thing, so if you go there don't miss it out! ||June 24, 2019
stephenkjones147||50||We took a food tour of Borough Market on our recent vacation to London and it was awesome to see such a thriving marketplace of local vendors. From fresh produce to fresh food this place is a must see if you are in the area. It was vibrant, packed with tourists and locals. Every kind of food you can imagine is available here. Saturdays are bustling and the market is extremely crowded, but this is a testament to how awesome it really is. This history of the market is fascinating too if you can take a local food tour with a guide you can learn all about how the market came to be.||June 24, 2019
Kingpaul100||50||Foodie heaven at London Bridge. Many opportunities to buy raw ingredients or cooked food from the take away stalls/ pop up units. Fab place to visit. ||June 23, 2019
sr_voyager||50||We're not street food people, so I was a bit wary of visiting the market, but I'd go every day if possible. You can definitely find great food and some places have tiny tables and chairs available, but for me the attraction was in the produce, cheese, etc. We stayed in an apartment, so had a kitchen available and stocked up on great heritage tomatoes, cheese, fresh bread, foie gras in an affordable quantity, etc. There are also restaurants in the area, but we discovered the Market too late to try any of them.||June 23, 2019
Leguizamo||50||I have picky kiddos so I was hoping there’d be enough options to find SOMETHING they’d eat. I ended up getting a grilled cheese and a massive hot dog that they split. I also got pulled pork Mac & cheese that was quite good & a few desserts! Lots of options for more adventurous eaters. ||June 22, 2019
srgauger||50||Really enjoyed exploring the food here. Had some fabulous cheese, chocolate, ice cream, pastries, and meat pies. Loved the feel of the crowd and people so friendly and helpful.||June 22, 2019
MamaDeal||50||You could eat your way through this market and feel very satisfied at the end! Lots of yummy selections including beer! Not alot of places to sit so make sure you can eat your food standing! If you are staying in an apartment or Airbnb, this would be a great place to shop for fresh produce and cheeses. Heard from the locals that is used to be more authentic with real farmers and produce but has become more corporate. Like so many other places.....Fun atmosphere and great place to nosh!||June 22, 2019
RoadtripMommy||40||There are so many traders and food options that we all had option paralysis. Unfortunately there are very few places to sit so if your family purchase food from different vendors you may just have to stand or get lucky and find a few open tables. There are tables reserved for a few of the restaurants and you will get asked to leave. The hours are short so a late lunch was what we could manage since the stalls close at 5. There are pubs and restaurants that cater to dinner but many are not family friendly - more like after work hang outs. ||June 22, 2019
d123265||30||Stopped here after seeing in on net, we had a drink and snack in pub, big food market all looked fresh, If on self catering break would be great ||June 21, 2019
ausnzaus||50||What a fantastic food market! So much fun to be had deciding what/where to eat.... Not to mention the fab stalls with things to take home. Particularly impressed with Spice mountain.||June 21, 2019
feil675||50||We loved the convenient location, variety food choices, the vibe and crowd. The food choices from fresh bread, meat, cheese, seafood, vegetables and fruits... With so many people, it is hard to find a spot to sit and eat. ||June 20, 2019
192282||50||We love food markets but this one is terrific. Loads of different options from fresh produce, specialty stalls, butchers, fish mongers, you name it, they have it. Loads of choices for food on the go, lunch, snacks or takeaway. We picked up some mouth watering local cheese from a small artisan to take home. We will return our next trip to London||June 20, 2019
HarryR140||50||A delicious array of cheeses, charcuterie, truffles, oysters etc. with sit down areas for tasting. A great wine bar is also in location. I’d be a regular visitor if living in London. ||June 20, 2019
Kdellis7||50||This is a must do in London! The food choices are amazing and the shopping is to die for!! The cheese stands are awesome as is the fresh and dried fruit. A must see for any foodie!!||June 19, 2019
anasofiaa237||40||Recommend this market because of its variety in food, it has a nice vibe, open space. It is not a must but maybe top 10 if you want to walk around and have something to eat.||June 19, 2019
Robin C||40||Third visit to London and finally got to this market that we have heard so much about. It's a nice size without being too large.There is such a variety of foods to taste you can spend hours strolling and grazing.We will visit again next time we are in town.||June 19, 2019
Gabigabs||50||Wish we had more time here. Absolutely loved the vibe and food choices. Brace yourself to be in a crowd, grab a beer or a glass of wine that you are free to roam with through the market, and enjoy the atmosphere. ||June 18, 2019
3genstraveling||50||Absolutely love the vibe, the crowd, the choices and the location. It's very busy as one would expect of a good market. Bring your own canvas bag to carry home your goodies. There are excellent choices of tasty breads, meats, cheeses, seafood, fresh and dried fruits and juices, vegetables, desserts (cheesecake was my favorite), nuts, truffles, olives and spices. Many vendors offer a tease of a free taste that is hard to resist. If you are looking for prepared food that is delicious and value for your money; this is the place! Oh and hidden in the market is one of the best barbershop's in London! Hobb's Barbershop is a small 2 seat shop with a great atmosphere. Mark did an excellent job of cutting my son's hair!||June 18, 2019
Jacqueline W||50||It was a bit overwhelming with so many options and so many people. difficult to find a spot to sit and eat, but highly recommend the fresh juices and the falafel stand||June 17, 2019
Maggie H||50||A real slice of old England with tons of stalls selling really tasty and special food . Wild mushroom risotto and Cornish oysters were a highlight||June 17, 2019
Kolletjie||50||Whether you looking for ready cooked food or fresh produce this is the place to go. A real character filled market offering wonderful fresh produce locally produced such as cheeses, cold meats, butcheries, fresh fruit and veg, artisinal breads, Borough Market had it all. Be sure to be hungry when you go there as there are loads of delicious eats to choose from. Extremely popular with locals and tourists alike||June 17, 2019
Tsveti D||50||Tons of offers! Great food. The atmosphere is just so good, especially on a sunny day. Best fish and chips in town.||June 16, 2019
Emily S||50||This is a fantastic place to pick up unusual foods or spices that are hard to find in supermarkets - I got some curry mixes and some ground cardamom from the spice stall, for example. It's usually pretty busy so expect to hustle your way through the crowds, but it's worth it - the hot food you can get there is delicious, the coffee is amazing, and Bread Ahead's doughnuts and cinnamon rolls are pretty unbeatable. Also there are loads of testers, so you can try out new cheeses, teas, and honeys. Brilliant!||June 16, 2019
CleopatraBunny||40||I thought coming after lunch would mean fewer people but it was really jammed. Made it nearly impossible to walk around. The usual assortment of cheese, meat, produce vendors. A huge line for Bread Ahead donuts and bread. Although historic and worth a visit, I didn’t enjoy getting pushed along with the throngs.||June 15, 2019
jessiejessie1234||50||I love this place. Such a wide variety of foods to feast on! It is very hard to choose what to buy. Come hungry!!||June 15, 2019
NicoleRG73||50||Borough Market is a must see when spending time in London. The market stands on a location that purveyors have been selling their good for nearly a 1000yrs. This place is a foodie heaven and is great place for delicious affordable eats as well as gifts and mementos that can be enjoyed at home. ||June 15, 2019
JahhhWigi||50||I was in sensory overload with all the different choices. We chose to have a pie and cider. And after that a coffee and pastries. ||June 15, 2019
Ghadeer2014||50||This is my 1st visit to BM. Borough Market is located at London Bridge. The BM is one of the largest and oldest food markets in London. I was so eager to explore the market based on what I have seen online and heard from previous visitors. The market was truly enjoyable and the food tasted was very fresh. The cheese choices were WOW. The market is big and varied. I highly recommend visitors to add it to their list of attractions. Kappacasein (melted cheese) & Bread Ahead Bakery (doughnuts) were on TOP of my list. I have come across great places such as Olivier’s bakery for a moist banana cake with caramelised taste, oliveology for an aromatic olives (oil) extracted with lemons, oranges and wild thyme & Tartufaia for truffle honey…etc (Brindisa, Richard Howard’s Oysters, The Olive Oil Company). Please note that the nearest tube is London Bridge (Jubilee & Northern Lines. NOT Borough Station!) By the way, Bridget Jones's Diary (2001 romantic comedy film) was filmed at Borough Market (SEE photo of her apt door). SEE photos. SEE my other reviews of Kappacasein, Rabot 1745 & Bread Ahead Bakery||June 15, 2019
ABeh||50||go hungry! so many types of food available. from cooked food to cheese, fruits and truffles. so yummy. store owners are nice and not pushy. enjoy the atmosphere. good coffee stores in the surrounding areas outside of Borough Market.||June 15, 2019
149jojo||50||This place will blow your culinary mind! More cheeses than you could imagine, fish, salamis, breads, pastries, sandwiches, eggs, butcheries, spices, oils, wines, vinegars, fruit and vegetables, cakes, sweets, street food - there is just too much to list everything. Open 10-5 Monday-Thursday, 8-5 Saturday and 10-6 Friday. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to wander around this large site. Grab groceries or just get something tasty for a takeaway. Get there on the tube stopping at London Bridge (Jubilee or Northern lines). Search GW45+5J London on your Google maps. ||June 14, 2019
Ian R||50||We browsed the market during a wet morning and were amazed at the high quality seafood, vegetables, fruit and meat on offer at the various stalls. The mussels were amazing as was the giant dishes of curry spreading their aroma through the market.||June 14, 2019
Libby130851||50||Markets were really interesting. The cheeses and meats were so good and the fruit and veg. Wished we could of taken some back to Aust. with us. Street food at its best.||June 13, 2019

ahote||50||It had been twenty years since I had been in London and discovering the Borough market and what it had flourished into was unbelievably thrilling and a joyous experience.I was finally again able to buy REAL eggs, REAL butter and REAL bread. The food stands were spectacular and the variety of food incredible. We spent hours there amidst the various fruit and vegetable stands, noshing on amazing cheeses and pies of various sorts.On my last foray to London, I was faced with the usual British food - mostly boiled - everything was boiled. If it wasn't boiled it was deep fried. The Borough Market now sports an incredible array of food that is served from small stands offering up culinary masterpieces.An absolute MUST if you visit London.||June 13, 2019
GenevieveQ21||50||I highly recommend you add a walk through Bourough Market to your list of "must dos" while in London. Such an incredible variety of foods, people, culture... go hungry and eat from different vendors' stalls... if you can name it, I bet you can find it here!||June 13, 2019
jason t||50||We started at the Monument and ventured across London Bridge to the market which is a good way to spend a few hours. The market was surprisingly diverse with many different foods and wares on offer. As far as markets go it's not the biggest but you should find something that you like.||June 12, 2019
SJS5900||50||What a great concept and variety of food! Tried a few stalls and the food was excellent. You get everything from dosas, wraps, pies to cookies to coffees.Must see when in London.||June 9, 2019
Connoisseur2006||40||This place mainly consists of foreign food stalls. Unique foods that I haven’t even heard of, and the busy atmosphere makes it an all-around fun place!||June 9, 2019
koat930||40||Love this place...so much things to view and eat. Esoecially on such a cooling weather, having the yummy risitto is the best! Wish I have more time, perhaps can pop over before I leave.||June 8, 2019
TravelerNotTourist30||50||It’s a great place to just walk around - small shops and great food stalls. There’s a great Ethiopian food stall. Also great falafels and desserts. I highly recommend it. It is pretty close to some of the main attractions - just south of the London bridge.||June 8, 2019
Travel_BaBa||40||Located in the middle of london, very close to the London Bridge area. This is a place where you can find the different cuisines this globe has to offer. small small shacks offer their specific cuisine. It is brimming with people all the time. We went to this ethiopian place and enjoyed the doro-wot. a great experience and especially if the sun is out, it just add to the overall experience. Folks, don't miss out on this place. I highly recommend it.||June 8, 2019
Jennifer S||50||Happened upon this market while walking around London and very much enjoyed our visit, seemed to transport us back in time.||June 8, 2019
Sc0000123||50||The meat was really well done! All the sides and roast extras were amazing! And deserts totally made it!||June 8, 2019
594DonnaW||50||The market was a short walk from or hotel so decided to spend a few hours shopping and have lunch. We got some delicious bake goods to take back to the hotel for snacks. The jammie dodgers were the best we had ever had. We stopped into one of the many sit down restaurants for lunch. I had the catch of the day Fish & Chips that melted in my mouth. We like the market so much we walked down for supper at least 2 more evenings. ||June 8, 2019
Margo7850p||50||The first mention of the Borough Market dates back to 1276, although the managers themselves claim to have existed since 1014. The marketplace currently consists of more than 100 stands, on which producers from all over the country sell a range of fresh products, including fish, meat, vegetables, cheese, bread, coffee, cakes and confectionery. Some stands specialize in products imported from abroad.Lively buzzing and varied - with tons of food on offer. Great to explore on foot. Just by London Bridge station and Southwark Cathedral - this historic market is bustling with activity most morning s - with a strong focus on food and meals you can eat there and then - with cuisine from all over the globe. Great place for all the family as its a market that everyone can enjoy with excellent food and drink .Borough Market and surrounding streets were used as a place of action for such movies as: The Journal of Bridget Jones (2001) . Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004).||June 8, 2019
Mark M||50||I went early in the morning the first day and it was peaceful and relaxing. I went around lunch time on day two and it was a md house! There were soooo many people. But still, it is worth going. The food is to die for. I could have eaten way too much but thankfully I didn’t . They have coffee vendors and baked goods and all kinds of food. I got a cookie on one day and cheesecake on the other. Both were great. One of my highlights while in London was going here. Take the London Bridge underground stop.||June 7, 2019
jrjojo||40||Wonderful array of cheese, fruit, vegetables and assorted spices. English strawberries are perhaps the best ever and anywhere.||June 7, 2019
WaxysLittleSis||50||A trip to London for us is not complete without a visit to Borough Market - different places to eat, great for picking up cheese, meat and breads to take back to your hotel for snacks.A lively vibrant place that has something for everyone - Enjoy!!||June 6, 2019
26eastman||30||We've got there after the close of the market but most of the stores were closed.Keep in mind that this market place will be closing earlier than many other market places we've visited in other countries. So if you want to see all the stalls, get there early. Many of the bars and retaurants were open but the most famouse restaurant had over an hour waiting time so make a reservation and look around the market before lunch or early dinner.||June 6, 2019
stephaniewalden1992||50||The food is amazing here! There is so much to see and try at this market. My advice is not to eat before coming here as there are so many delicious food stands! ||June 5, 2019
Pandamedic||40||We had a small visit here and it was great to see all the different stalls. For some reason i had it in my head Borough Market was going to be a large place, but it really wasn't as big as i had believed.||June 5, 2019
MrSnyman||40||Awesome everything. little bit over rated. The hype is bigger then it should be but still worth the visit||June 4, 2019
Michelle M||50||Our group was so grateful for the other reviews on here of Borough Market or we may have missed it! It was so fun to wander through the market and try different foods that others had reviewed. We could have stayed all day, but only had a few hours to spend. It was a nice change from going to museums and castles all day. We loved the Bread Ahead donuts (although we walked past them twice and were hard to find for some reason), the Kappacasein grilled cheese was amazing, and the Ethiopian food was super good! We will definitely be back! ||June 4, 2019
Dana T||50||Love the produce and food,but one needs to re-mortgage to shop there,sadly.It's still a fun day for friends and family.||June 4, 2019
toristtorisk||40||I love to go to Borough Market and eat at La Mia Pasta. Stalls are beautifully displayed and it's a real feast for the eyes. Sitting areas are not great and not that many, so be prepared to eat your pasta standing. If you shop you will find a great selection, but prices reflect the name and fame of the market. A fun day out, you can then walk by the river and return to the North of the river by Millenium bridge. A great walk!||June 4, 2019
CornishJacki||50||Borough Market was foodie heaven. An amazing array of fresh produce and a wide variety of eating-places serving different cuisines – it was difficult to choose what to eat. Definitely recommend visiting.||June 4, 2019
Maria V||50||We were there on a Saturday, so it was rather busy! The food stalls are out of this world and you really need to take your time and browse around. We bought a variety of tasty goodies to eat but the chips (my all time favorite) were amazing and the pies from Pieminister are out of this world! Difficult though to find a place to sit down and eat.||June 4, 2019
Mr V||40||Lovely historical place, culinary delights. They have tried to make it more appealing with seating areas.Go and give your tastebuds a workout instead of the same old same old national chain eateries. You won't regret it.||June 4, 2019
richmou||50||Love Borough Market. London Bridge tube station is the closest and there are so many food related stores selling all different cuisines. Local or tourist just visit and enjoy ||June 3, 2019
areyes279||50||You gotta go here hungry and around lunchtime cuz there are so many selections. This place has alot of places to choose from and its also a green market. Highly recommend||June 3, 2019
holidayseeker||40||Loved Borough market , great food stalls and tasty dishes to try. Easy to access from London Bridge station.||June 3, 2019
Melocynic||50||If London is the crown of England, Borough Market might be its jewel. Various food vendors flaunting their specialty goods. Each one different from the rest. Walking through the market, you'll be arrested by the alluring perfume of Indian, Thai curries to deep fried Scotch eggs and calamaris.There are plenty to see, cookies the size of your head, beautiful pastries, cheeses, olive oils, honeys, fishes. It's vibrant place. Not to be missed.||June 2, 2019
djw1955||50||Visited Borough Market which was busy but enjoyable. Plenty to see even if the market was not full open.great market to wonder around, see the different foods on offer. Really enjoy visiting this market regular when in London. Friendly staff and clean environment. great to pass a couple hours away.||June 2, 2019
DLL23||50||Great choice of food, plenty of stalls selling cheeses, breads, meats, jams, vegetables, fruits and beer! Wonderful market, a must do when you’re in London!||June 2, 2019
Rachel B||50||This market is not to be missed!! Super cool area ! Food market mostly but the food stalls are amazing! Samples are plenty. Make sure to check it out if you are in the area ! Well worth it!||June 2, 2019
JANIEandKEN||50||Everything looked delicious! So many varieties of food, made our mouths water! :) We ate lunch here. I had Chinese Noodles with Veggies and my hubby had a hand made salt-beef burger. ||June 2, 2019
LetsgoGeorgia||50||Anyone who appreciates food will love this place. In addition to the stalls selling incredible cheeses, baked goods, produce, and other groceries, a wide variety of ethnic food stations offer lunch items that you can take to a nice seating area near the front. I wish we could have gone back to sample more of the delicious offerings.||June 1, 2019
MargieM795||50||Not a produce or craft market. Lovely selection of food stalls, could eat here every day and not get through it all. Lots of organic and other healthy foods. They do have meat, fish, cheese and bread stalls etc stalls but less of veggies. Only downside was the lack of seating to eat. Buy delicious food and take it to the southbank embankment to eat||June 1, 2019
gabrielsmom||50||HOLY FOODNESS BATMAN! Spend time but do yourself a favor. Get yourself a tour guide like we did. Keven was AWESOME and included not only a tasting of the best this crazy and wonderful place has to offer, but we soaked in history while feasting on the BEST FISH AND CHIPS we had in London. Be prepared to spend time. Sample. ITS FUN! AND DELICIOUS! Hungry people unite!||June 1, 2019
360rashika||40||Why haven’t I been here before! is what I asked myself the moment I stepped into this place full of vibrant fragrances and colours.What hits you is the buzz around every stall/open shop.It is also an amalgamation of humans from all over the world.Ah it’s a typical tourist market...that’s why I haven’t been before My friend visiting from India and her seven year old and me strolled in there post lunch time on a mild May Day.The freshness of the vegetables, baked breads and food stalls is unmissable.Its a Interesting set of curiosities for a seven year old who was taken in by the fresh from flowers honey stall.We got to taste the various varieties for sale there and settled for the coriander field yield.Yum!Take cash along for your small purchases but cards also accepted in most stalls.We tried the fresh crispy squid which was outstanding in terms of freshness and flavour.Washed it down with some freshly squeezed cranberry and lemon juice.There is loads to choose from in terms of food stalls.With vegan choices, non vegetarian and vegetarian too , it’s a place for everyone.Grab yourself an exotic flavour, spot a bench and eat away whilst people watching||May 31, 2019
Lord_Dehf||40||Even though this is a tourist trap, it's a surprisingly good one. Good variety and not to expensive.||May 31, 2019
CarolMH_319||50||A trip to London will never be complete without a visit to Borough Market. It's tempting to try all the foodies!!! For snacks, I had pistachio macarons at Comptoir Gourmet and a cup of tea at Tea 2 You! For lunch, I had paella and it was wonderful, while my table mates had sea urchins and blanched giant oysters! The Borough Market is a food tripping haven for food adventurers. Do it!||May 30, 2019
Reeves8788||50||Borough Market was one of our must dos on a recent trip to London. I am so happy it was too! There is so much to see and soooo much to eat! Be prepared to make hard decisions between all of the good food and ready to eat way to much! LOL There is pretty much any kind of food that you can think of at this market. If we lived in London, we would visit ALL the time!||May 29, 2019
hunco||50||What a delightful place to take in with all the food and the sights. Vendors are friendly and offer many samples of the food they sell. Has an upbeat atmosphere. Be sure to go.||May 29, 2019
Judy M||40||Always wanted to go here and it didn't disappoint. Every kind of food and lots more. Great atmosphere throughout the market. Very busy but great to explore around it. ||May 28, 2019
CHARLESKH55||40||We have both been to the Borough Market in past, we decided to give it a another try. My wife and myself got the train from Tonbridge a little bit earlier as to miss the crowds. Walked from London Bridge Station over the road to the market there are lots of food stalls selling all different types of food stuff. There are restaurants, pubs, stalls shops. A good choice for meat and veggie eaters. A good place for buying fish cheese,meat,eggs,dips,rubs,fruit,vegetables,plates,all sorts. You name it they probably have it. Lots to see, lots to taste, freebies. A good place to visit, but price’s a bit over the top, maybe London tourist prices. A enjoyable morning out but got busy as lunch time came. Close to the Shard. Other London attractions nearby.||May 28, 2019
Harrisj71||40||Wow - just amazing food & ingredients all over the place. Not as large as you think but the smells and free tastes are absolutely extraordinarily good. If you think you a foodie go and visit. ||May 27, 2019
SanjeevGKunte||40||Good market near London Bridge for buying fresh meat, vegetables, cheese, craft breads etc. Or for just whiling away an hour & window shopping.||May 27, 2019
lyndseyjayne||40||Lots of choice of food, not really suitable for children although our 4 year old enjoyed an ice cream. Mostly food places and would have enjoyed it more as a couple I believe but still worthwhile visiting. ||May 26, 2019
lobster64||30||We have visited a few times but there was something different , a lot of stall holders have migrated to the Maltby street market. There are many cheese stalls here now. Which means there is less choice than previously. Still a place for tourists to flock to as it was packed.||May 26, 2019
Dr_Effingpot||40||Heard so much about this place and visited for the first time today. It's full of street food and is an interesting place but it seems to be full of olive oil shops and cheese places. Was expecting a bit more variety. Ended up spending about 10 mins only as it was so repetitive. Worth a look for sure but have other stuff planned too :-)||May 25, 2019
Liad H||50||Great market! Really enjoyed my short stay there. Unlike the other markets in London, this one seems less crowded. Many food stalls, shops and bars to pick from. Great atmosphere. Don't miss it.||May 24, 2019
pauldletsgo||50||This time of year the weather was perfect and the crowds were light, so you could really enjoy the market without shuffling along with the press of tourists and have the luxury of spending time with some of the merchants. We met the nicest people selling good English cheeses, Italian cheeses and prosciutto, and flavored olive oils. One cheese monger was delighted to take the time to explain the cheese making process and let us sample a cheese that he had made. We had a great time and left thinking nothing but good thoughts about London. ||May 23, 2019
Travelaround59||40||Borough Market is fun! First I like the fact that the place (under vaults and train tracks) has been maintained and saved and the market has appeared. Secondly all the food stalls with a mixture of smells that grab your senses: a triumph of street food!Of course the fact that was lunch time and we were hungry and that the weather was lovely really helped the overall experience.||May 22, 2019
Mark D||50||Really enjoyed wandering around Market, sampling different foods and picking up a lunch for later in the day. Lots of international food choices||May 22, 2019
ElizabethLilly||50||I stopped by here for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon (around 2 p.m.) and met up with my friend. It's packed and you probably won't find a place to sit while you eat or drink the stuff you buy. YET, it is so wonderful if that doesn't scare you! You just have to be game for that going into it. But most importantly, the food is amazing! I inhaled an amazing duck confit wrap from Le Marché Du Quartier and washed it down with from delish rum punch from the same stall. I also stopped for some cheese samples at a few nearby stalls. You could spend hours upon hours there, so if you're a food this is a MUST. No, it's just a must regardless! You'll need to eat food while you're in London, so you should go here and do it for at least one meal.||May 21, 2019
Vicki D||40||It's more commercialised than I remember from a few years back, but the diverse food the owners offered was fresh and interesting. Cheese from France & The Balkins, meats from Spain, Malay curries, fresh fruit & veg, freshly squeezed juices, etc etc. Worth a visit if you're a foodie!||May 21, 2019
lucyrhay||50||There's all kinds to see here and lots of the stalls have tasters. Lovely hidden gem in the centre of London.||May 21, 2019
541cheriec||50||I have been coming to Borough Market for 20 years and it’s wonderful to see how it has flourished, with new stands appearing every time I visit. Incredible variety. I particularly love the mushroom and fungi stall called Turnips. Keep your eyes peel for celebrity chefs choosing their fresh produce and television crews making documentaries. Can’t wait for a vegan cheese stall to make an appearance! ||May 20, 2019
Rzrcat2018||40||One could visit this area for a month and have a different lunch from the wide variety of vendors each day. We had the lamb with cous cous which was delicious.||May 20, 2019
lenphotographic||50||This is a great place for foodies, even though not cheap the selection and unusual items are great. The place is heaving with tourist especially on a Saturday. We always drive up and arrive after 1 so can park near by. Need too as have so many bags full of produce. A good tip is to go to the fruit and veg at the end of the day as they just want to get rid and there are some great bargains. Cheese, spices, meats, fish,and plenty to feed yourself on as you walk around. A great salt beef sandwich is always a must. The biggest Paella is always cooking. I love the mushroom selection. Brilliant fruit and veg at Turnips.||May 19, 2019
Marta J||50||Outstanding streetfood, variety of coffee and pastries so you can have any meal you want in here. And if you belong to those people who bring food as a souvenir you should definietely go shopping here and find yourself some good quality products.||May 19, 2019
Brady69||40||A great place for tourists to get a flavour and taste of England.Busy and vibrant with so many food options. Some of the food stalls are outstanding and the smells of food from across the Globe are just amazing.Be prepared for the hustle and bustle but that is part of the charm. Avoid double buggies ||May 19, 2019
Toff-the-lop||40||A tourist and hipster Hotspot, busy with a massive choice of most things, steeped in History too, Deli's, fruit, bakery's, seafood, Artisan offerings, Tea's, Coffees, juice and a proper drink, lots of Homemade stuff and no surprise many jumping on the 'Vegan' bandwagon, its everywhere, its the 'in thing' the korean food stall was very nice, but beware our rice was under cooked, they thought it was cooked (and probably still think that) but anyone who knows their rice will know, can only assume they didn't have rice experiance, swapped for the steam buns instead at £8.50 real nice, only been mid mornings, reckon it gets very busy later on, a must visit, not a bargain to be had, but top quality, and its London after all.||May 18, 2019
fameboy67||50||This is the first time we have been to the market and it was superb. Lots of great stalls to buy a variety of food and also plenty of stalls with hot food. Lush lush lush||May 18, 2019
JANNY_JANZ||50||We visited Borough Market on a Monday so there were "limited" stalls. There were tons of stalls open though. Make sure you visit Borough Market on an empty stomach as you'll want to sample everything!||May 17, 2019
WeWantAnotherHoliday||50||Huge selection of vendors with foods from all over the world. We visited at lunchtime and the market was busy. Lots of wonderous dishes to try and lots of ingredients to buy and take home. We had wanted to come here for a few years now and we're so glad we did. I'm a big lover of German food and the German Deli market stall was brilliant with a big selection of German bratwurst!||May 17, 2019
WJW0126||50||My wife had heard about the Borough Market, and although I was not too keen to go, off we went. She was right, it was a good choice. The sights and smells as you enter this little world are incredible. Every type of food and drink you can think of. We first got yummy, yummy donuts from Bread Ahead Bakery. Just supurb. We then shared a mouth-watering Sausage Roll from the Ginger Pig. But the best of the day was the Cheesy, Cheesy Grilled cheese sandwich from the Kappacasein Cheese Stall. I can still taste it now! We knew it would be good, as there was a cue in front of it, but the 10 minute wait for our own sandwich was worth it. Fresh coffee smells, Tea, chocolates, mouth-watering delicasy's from all over make it hard to walk too fast past each stall and not take in the aroma. A great place to get great food. Good job setting up a place like this. Go to this Market, and you will not be disappointed!||May 17, 2019
StuartW2266||50||Brilliant. Extensive number of stalls and shops selling very tempting food & produce. Cheese, meat, spices, small goods, sweets, cakes, wine, beer, the list is endless. All top quality and many offering a taste sample for you to decide. A big area with only a small area not covered. Very busy on the Saturday morning we went through. Could not resist the cakes & Turkish Delight.||May 16, 2019
Rebecca M||50||If only I could sample everything! This place is a bustling foodie's dream! A person could spend all day walking around and trying so many different cuisines. Most of the shop owners are happy to talk to you about their food, the origin, how its made and some recipes that you can use. If you have not experienced Borough Market, you are missing out!||May 16, 2019
DrLakeflower||40||Perfect place for a couple of hours indulgence in eating and drinking suff that are prepared before your eyes. Yes, you can shop here and bring home good things to eat. Enjoyable amtomsphere.||May 14, 2019
Peter C||50||You can get great, affordable food here and some of the stalls have some amazing offers at times, especially towards the end of the day. Sometimes there is music or a famous chef might give a talk to visitors. I look to the Beer stall to buy great craft beers from around the world or visit its sister bar, The Rake on the edge of the Market behind the Gents. Here they have even more great beers with a large number of taps and can cater for Beer Festivals sometimes. I have seen famous TV actors in here and heard rumours of film actors working nearby. If you are disgusted with gents, PLEASE don't shout at the Rake's bar staff (as I have heard someone doing) because the Rake only has room for a ladies, so the Gents definitely belongs to the Market!||May 14, 2019
b0bk2017||50||bought a lot of different food items - cheeses and breads, sampled lots of other food - wife tried fried duck - grease trapped in tough meat - got a few exotic spices. Very good pastries.||May 14, 2019
Felicity C||50||I love Borough Market!Particularly the yummy yummy Mushroom Pate which is my reason for going in... Go get some Bread Ahead Sourdough too... Yum. Toilets too which is super handy. ||May 13, 2019
David C||50||Visited Borough market last week and visited The Free From Bakehouse stall. Marvellous choice of Gluten free products we bought four separate items and they were all scrum my. Reccomended for a visit by Coeliacs.||May 12, 2019
andij1066||50||Love going down to borough market for breakfast when in London especially Turnips fruit and veg for mushrooms on toast plus this morning fresh local asparagus and plenty more street food to try well worth a visit ||May 11, 2019
Y8689CIdebbiew||50||This place is first and foremost the best market in London. Put aside the non permanent stalls, the core hub of the market is quality every day it’s open.From more quirky drunk cheese to just massive full wheel Comte, you can find everything you would want to feed your inner Gromit. The veg is amazing. The speciality food stalls (chutneys etc) are awesome. Just a food lovers delight. Not sure when Brindisi opened a shop in the market but so pleased they have as now I can have the pleasure of their amazing chorizo at home ... winner for me as I love it and also top wife award from husband when he saw it in fridge!Visiting when the market is in full swing is a must-do but slightly frustrating experience as the hustle and bustle can be quite annoying as your trying to dip in and out in front of stalls looking at their fare (and having some cheeky tasters). Lunch brings the crowds for tasty paella’s and other large format cooking so come with an empty belly.||May 10, 2019
I3337NIdavids||50||Foods, cheeses, juices, meats, organic sand otherwise - what a wonderful place to get lost in. Eat, drink and be merry is my motto and if you come here you’re on heavens doorstep. There are a variety of choices and everyone of them is delicious. We just loved mingling with the crowd and enjoying the atmosphere surrounding the market. If you have the opportunity come and enjoy instead of going home and saying I wish I would have done...||May 10, 2019
zeneszerzo||50||If you want to taste special things, check this market out. It is full of people, but some lines are definitely worth your time. Go for sea food if you like those things, everything is fresh! ||May 9, 2019
TravelsofCorina||50||Awesome market! Always buzzing with people and fantastic vendors. There are many different cusinies offering delicious hot and cold dishes and snacks, sweet treats, cheese, flowers, homemade goodies, meat, fish EVERYTHING! Reasonably priced too. Expected to pay between £5-£10 for most food/drink items. A lot of vendors give out free samples which is lovely as you stroll through. Highly recommended!!! ||May 9, 2019
DarrenFord_za||40||A great place to stop off if you are hungry problem is you will have no idea what to get as you are exposed to everything food wise here!From Asian, seafood and scotch eggs you have it all! ||May 9, 2019
Eva P||50||After visiting the Tower Bridge we decided to stroll around the Market.it was amazing to see all the different food and the little stalls where you can buy almost everything.||May 8, 2019
SerabiV||50||Grab a pint and go walk around the Borough Market. There are lots and lots of food vendors, meat, fish, produce, flowers, cheeses, breads, pastries, coffee, tea, sandwich stalls and food trucks to grab a bite of lunch. There also seems to be 1 or 2 places to sit and dine. It is located not far from London Bridge.Enjoy!||May 8, 2019
Mike0210||50||Wonderful place for a wander round. Spectacular displays of fresh produce, plenty to try before you buy and stalls selling hot / cold food.||May 8, 2019

danjor44||50||it is steaped in history and still sells food and 10 min walk from the shard. and an old church alas I have forgo ton its name||May 7, 2019
Susan F||40||Friends took us to Borough Market specifically because I wanted my teenager to see it. We enjoyed an amazing fresh-pressed juice, then he had a Bratwurst that he talked about for two days (plus bought more to cook for dinner later in the week). I ate one of the best things I've ever tasted -- a Portuguese pork wrap with amazing vegetables and sauce. The market has an energetic vibe and there are all sorts of people there, all ages, tourists and locals. It is very crowded, though, which made my son a bit uncomfortable at moments when we were squeezing between stalls and people. If crowds bother you, markets like this probably aren't for you. Otherwise, it's a wonderland of goods and food and I wish we'd had longer to spend meandering through.||May 7, 2019
Ulisse d||50||to me it is a spot worth visiting, both to buy groceries or other produces, or to eat at the many food stalls that offer an amazing variety of food from all regions in the world.||May 7, 2019
daichef2||50||Been to visit quite a few times but never disappoints. Its very busy but affording lots of fresh foods from around the EU from Gorwydd in West Wales to Comté from the Jura region of France. There’s the complete range of artisan chocolate, vegan, vegetarian foods as well as a large range of meats to tempt everybody. The atmosphere is buzzing and the produce amazingly presented in the arches of London Bridge. ||May 6, 2019
Suzanne H||50||Our Airbnb is a 10-min walk from Borough Market. We got there around 2pm on a Sunday.Super crowded, should to shoulder everywhere. But any line for food stalls moved quickly. I tried the Bao place. It was so soft and tasty, though pricy at £5 for 1 bao! Also tried the Bratwurt hot off the grill and that was yummy too. Tried the Pad Thai place which is only ok, but their coconut pancakes are delicious!We got 4 donuts from the Donut shop. We love them.We didn't know what to expect. Now we know. There is hardly any sitting. Expect to stand and eat.All in all was a great experience to check out the famed Borough Market. ||May 6, 2019
Jeri N||50||Was so many different selections and all smelled delicious. Be prepared for crowds, but totally worth it! Oh, but btw... they are closed sundays.. :( ||May 6, 2019
Eirinn1975||50||A fantastic market where you can find an incredible amount of delicacies: cheese, sea food, Asian specialties, coffee, sweets, cured meat. If you are a foodie, do not miss it. You'll be surprised! ||May 5, 2019
IainandLorraine||50||What a fabulous place to lose a few hours, and gain a few pounds!!!! The market is very busy so take your time wandering around. Every taste is catered for and every food type is available, most cooked fresh in front of you. Lots of stalls doing sauces, mustards, chilli etc. and more doing Gin, Cider, Wine of all flavours and varieties. Even if you don't eat here it is just a fabulous place to walk round taking in the atmosphere.||May 5, 2019
rebeljenn||50||Borough Market - really great market but very busy on saturdays. get here early. Market is smaller during the week and closed sundays. Saturday is the day to go. I also used to visit sometimes for lunch toward the end of the week. Tip: To get the most of your visit, I suggest start at St. Paul's Cathedral. Walk across the Millennium Bridge to the south bank. The Tate is in front of you. Walk past Shakespeare's globe and under Southwark bridge here, then walk past more of the restaurants/pubs and under the bridge where the clink prison museum is...if you turn right, you go down one street by Borough Market. If you continue to go straight, you will be next to winchester palace ruins on the right and in front is Drake's ship and this takes you past southwark cathedral to the other side of Borough Market. Make sure you look around under the bridges/nearby street to the side of the markets as there's some really quality stuff for sale here. On rare occasions, BM is open on sundays. If you get here for late October, you can visit for their special Apple Day festival.Just a warning that it gets so busy on saturdays so come early to avoid the crush.||May 5, 2019
Brian S||50||I dropped by the market because it was lunch time. I was overwhelmed. There was a very large crown of people there. The market had a lot to offer. Many food choices. Something from all parts of the world. All of it looked very good. All the stalls had long lines. The wait was worth it. What I got was very good. I ended up going back again the next day to eat at the market again.||May 4, 2019
565phillipr||50||Walking from food stall to food stall you can get lost in the shear variety. Fish and chip? Yes please. Chorizo? Of coarse! ||May 4, 2019
hbradley75||50||Well worth the visit. Called here for lunch on a Saturday. It was very busy around this time, however, the vibe was great. We had Malaysian curry and macaroni cheese with pulled pork. Both around £7 which was very good value. This place is something very special and unique. ||May 4, 2019
92stem||40||Occupying a tradition covered market hall, Borough Market now hosts a wide selection of artisan food stalls from across the globe. There is a good mix of hot food vendors with many offering tasting samples, and those offering the likes of meat, fish, cheese, and bread to take home. A bit of a tourist trap, but its quite atmospheric and well worth a visit !||May 3, 2019
heguangz||40||Awesome place to try different kinds of food from different origins and different types is fusion food. Some vendors don’t take credit cards so make sure you do have some cash in hand. ||May 3, 2019
Lil_big_traveller||50||Everything from artisanal cheeses and meets, duck confit sandwiches, ethnic and vegetarian choices to your hearts content or a good old fashioned hot dog and kraut with six different sauce options! This is a place to eat drink and people watch to your hearts content. Even on a rainy day, we stayed for over an hour and came back two days later! Don't miss this place!||May 3, 2019
Spikoli||50||Took our teen daughters here for lunch and were pleasantly overwhelmed with options- so many delicious street food vendors, stores/shops. We could have come back 5 days in a row and still enjoyed every stop. Tons of good places to grab a quick bite. Be sure to see the cathedral right next store - stunning interior as well. Very memorable part of our London trip!||May 3, 2019
jochg2016||50||Visited today. This is a market steeped in history, a culinary, gastronomic delight with herbs, spices, preserves, oils and honeys from every corner of the world. The fruit and veg looked so very fresh. Breads, cheeses and both sweet and savoury delicacies. A fabulous atmosphere and done wonderful characters amongst the traders. Great to visit. A must. ||May 2, 2019
321rupertr||50||I love Borough Market, it has been here for hundreds of years and the cariety of fresh produce never fails to impress. As well as taking some goodies home, the street market stalls tempt you in with some amazing smells of wonderful food on the go||April 30, 2019
Lauren S||50||I was told about this place but never imagined the scale of the place. Jam packed with different foods, oils, sweets, drink and keepsakes from around the world. Very busy place and can get quite hard to move, quieter times seem to be between 4 - 5 when the marketers are closing up (and you get the bargains of the day!). Highly recommended to visit and try some amazing goodies.||April 29, 2019
samjed||40||We enjoyed the fish piallea from one stall. And almond slice from the Spanish shop. Good atmosphere and a great collection of goodies. To view and buy. ||April 29, 2019
loveofmaneki||40||We made the fatal error of going on a bank holiday Monday! Despite fantastic food stalls and delicious treats on offer the jaunt around it was most uncomfortable and rushed due to very large crowds. Will return another time to make the most of the market and sample some of the goodies on offer.||April 29, 2019
Q5940NSbrianh||50||We travelled by bus to London Bridge on this occasion but the sights and smells in this market are exceptional.The fresh meat, fish and vegetables are fantastic to see as well as taste or buy.There are prize winning restaurants inside the market area too.Easily accessible to everyone and an all round historical market experience with modern day dietary options.||April 29, 2019
KERRYBRIDGE||50||I cannot believe after all my visits to London I have only just been told about this place. If your a foodie you will love this. The food sold is high quality, a lot of it cones from farms and is not sold in the high street, there are lots of unusual stuff but it’s not cheap, it’s quality. I had not seen white strawberries before but they sold them here. We tucked into a dozen large oysters. They were so tasty. Not like the ones I usually have back at home. There was a Great atmosphere on the market. Alcohol was sold and served in plastic glasses. It’s very busy on the market and a lot of the stalls have samples you can try. There are several excellent Cheese stalls, fish, dips, spices ect. The market looks very old and has kept its history. I would definitely recommend a visit. I will be back again very soon ||April 28, 2019
Julie T||50||Amazing place with so many food stalls, with any type of food you can imagine. It was busy but has a great atmosphere. I bought some wonderful fudge from Whirld - pic 'n' mix so you can choose what you want! Definitely worth a visit, and we will go again.||April 28, 2019
anita w||30||I adore street food and food markets, especially as a contrast to our usual dining experiences, but perhaps I got too comfy lately, because as good as the offering were, I was miserable not finding a place to sit down to eat.We took a taxi over from the hotel to sample the different delicacies, as the market just reopened after the long Easter weekend, We started at the Bermondsey cheese raclette stand on the side street. The raclette with baby potatoes and gherkins was great, but very messy to eat standing up (and to share), never mind trying to photograph it while holding it (yes I am guilty of that, but that is why I can now attach a picture). By the time we scored the Malaysian laksa, Spanish paella, some knockwurst and cabbage etc. on the inside of the market, I really wanted / needed to sit down to properly enjoy the fare, and got rather grumpy. I finally found an edge of a bench behind some planter with other people's leftovers littering the ground around my feet. On a gorgeous sunny day, it would been nice to linger longer, instead of just inhaling the food as fast as possible, but maybe that is the formula ?||April 28, 2019
LSlawny||50||Lots of people lots of great things to eat and drink. Very friendly people. I bet you can’t go here and leave without trying a few things...... great lunches, cheeses, bakery, and some of the most unique jams and sauces I’ve ever had.||April 28, 2019
tinci72||50||We actually accidently went through this market in the harth of the city and find it really amazing. There is lots of international food, specially a lot of Italian with cheese, spices, great bread, also lots of places to eat, for example great big hamburgers, etc.||April 28, 2019
christophermO3624HZ||50||A member of our party had done the research but surprised us with visiting the Market. Think Reading Terminal Market (Philly), Pike Place Market, or any similar city's market combining food options, vegetable stands, etc., but now quadruple it, add some of the best cheese options, wine options, barbers, tea stands, deserts of unusual size, and food variety. Our party of eight managed a pizza, a bacon cheese burger, an egg/bacon/sausage sandwich (with chips), paella, light and crispy calamari, and two excellent sausages. The space seemed overwhelming with the number of options we did not get to including meat pie stands, butchers (with butchering in front of you), and fish options. Especially a great stop if on the south side of the Thames and wandering from the Tower Bridge to the Globe.||April 27, 2019
FarAway782870||50||We travelled to London for a football match at Wembley. We spent the afternoon at Borough Market with all its great stalls, bars and restaurants and met many people from all over the Uk enjoying the great atmosphere.||April 27, 2019
TEC_273||50||Cracking market with just about anything you need and a lot that you don’t. We had a great time here just exploring what was around the next corner. Particular highlights included fresh oysters washed down with a builders tea from a proper cafe. Magic||April 27, 2019
deanbpjs||50||If you’re a foodie, you can’t not visit Borough Market. Just by the south end of London Bridge and close to the station and Southwark Cathedral, this is a real gem of a place. Loads and loads of stalls, showcasing everything from Greek olives to French cassoulet to oysters and Thai street food. I’m like one of those kids in a sweet shop who gets to the point of depression, knowing that you can’t possibly try everything that’s on offer - there’s almost too much choice. Oh and cheeses - there’s enough cheese choices to send you mad and some incredible fruit and veg as well!Drinks wise, there’s a couple of bars and also some vintners and a spirits stall.Serious notes:1. It gets busy - very busy. Quite a few of the crowds seem oblivious to their surroundings and that can make getting around a bit tough (especially if like my other half, you have limits mobility). I snapped at a couple of people who tried barging their way past.2. It’s not cheap. It’s not exorbitant either. Entry is free and you can get round without spending any money if you want. But if you do want to eat, then a takeaway paella will set you back somewhere between £7 and £10. There’s also a cookwear shop. Some nice stuff admittedly, but I’m not paying £27 for 3 tea-towels; not now; not ever! Overall, if you’re on the south bank and at a loss, you could do a whole lot worse than kill off a couple of hours wandering around here; if you’re into food, you could also do a lot lot worse ||April 27, 2019
S6046UUsteves||50||Great area with fantastic food options. All the vendors are passionate and knowledgeable about their wares. Lots of tasting opportunities and sites to take in. Hidden gem below south side of The London Bridge.||April 26, 2019
david n||40||Just next to Southwark Cathedral, this is a very busy place. Tons of food stalls and queues everywhere for most stalls. Only negative is finding a place to eat the food that you have just bought.||April 26, 2019
TracerMain||50||This market is simply astonishing. Great food great atmosphere. I would recommend getting there early just so you can find a place to sit and so there are short lines. Let’s be honest unless you live on the river Thames it was probably a long walk so you NEED seats. I got oysters and smoked salmon at a random restaurant at the market and it was fantastic, but wherever you go it will be magical. Highly recommend.||April 26, 2019
Peter R||40||This is a great place to come and see all the produce and drinks available. The amount of food places is just amazing and most foods can be bought here. You get off at the London Bridge underground stop. Great place to have a meal and a drink as well.||April 24, 2019
670MichelM||50||A really great place for the food enthusiast. Good prices and you will find food from almost everycorner of the world. The only negative thing is that is was really crowded.||April 24, 2019
Hoppityskip||50||Lots of choice not bad prices and 0930 means far less tourists so much more relaxing.Had a wondrous bacon roll at Marias||April 24, 2019
macedonboy||40||Here there is something for every taste, lots of stalls selling street food, drinks and alcohol. Some of the stalls sell more artisanal items such as breads, cheese etc. Definitely worth wandering around if you are in the area. The only downside is that the place is so popular, it's a bit touristy and packed with people, especially over the Easter weekend.||April 23, 2019
tomisonfire||50||Stumbled upon this place whilst exploring London, and it's an absolute treat. Would recommend to anyone looking to taste anything exotic, or just to pick up vegetables!||April 23, 2019
tjeason||40||You will see all sorts of types of foods here. Cash is probably best, but some will take cards. The spice market is my favorite and they have a generous selection for you to browse.||April 23, 2019
livbundy89||40||We came here around 10:30am on a sunny Saturday and as expected, the market was in full swing. This is not the kind of place to go if you hate crowds - there are literally thousands of people crammed into what is not a huge space. The smells of the stalls and the tasters you pick up as you are swept along are well worth the hassle though. We had some of the most delicious chocolates and cakes here for free!When it comes to actually buying things you are spoilt for choice - from baked goods and confectionary to fresh oysters and the best fruit and veg stall ever. You can chow down on everything from a paella to a veggie curry, via carribean foods, coffee and middle eastern cuisine. Just be aware - there is a serious price tag!To me, street food should be cheaper than restaurant food, but that isn't always the case here. You can pick up a few bargains but ultimately you have to be prepared to part with your cash if you are going to enjoy yourself fully. I also suggest doing one full trip around the market before you choose what you want to eat/buy as it's almost certain that once you pick something you will then come across something else you may have preferred!||April 23, 2019
layla_eats||50||Amazing variety of food. Fantastic quality. Me and my boyfriend love coming up here to try out loads of different types of food. However it can get very over crowded. Also there is nowhere to sit down with the food you purchase from different places. What can get quite annoying. We ended up sitting on the floor. Really lovely fresh fresh, fruit and veg markets. Such a fabulous place to visit if you love your food. ||April 22, 2019
Leslie D||50||The variety of food is wonderful. The atmosphere is very market like; bustling with people. Artisan bread. Wheat grass smoothies made to order. Raw seafood. Cheeses. And so much more.||April 22, 2019
FatEvilMonkey||50||You see it on vlogs online and it looks quiet but in fact it’s jam packed ! It also was 1 in the after noon when we made it here ! Make sure to stop at Brindisa! Bread Ahead Bakery for the Vanilla custard and Chocolate Custard donuts ! Also lots of beer and wine ! ||April 22, 2019
soinic||20||On Easter Saturday in the afternoon this market was overcrowded... stinky, trash everywhere and this ambience didn't tempt us at all to try something from the many stalls offering all kind of food.Many tourists were sitting on the sidewalks to eat.... no thank you :|||April 20, 2019
heumanntouch||40||There is so much to see and do at the Market. It does get very busy at times and there is too many people in a limited space. There is so many things to eat and all different types of cuisine. Everything from sausage, cheese, fresh fruit, fish and if it comes into the city it makes an appearance at the market. ||April 20, 2019
JonathanD852||50||If you love exploring food this is a must visit while in London. You should come early and as well as early in your visit to take great treats to snack on back to your hotel. There is something for everyone! This food only very retailers of anything else. Again, it's all about the food!||April 20, 2019
KLVHG||50||We always love to visit Borough Market when we come to London. It’s always busy but it’s worth it. Our top tip is to do a full tour before you decide what to eat because there is so much choice. ||April 19, 2019
sefakorkwame||50||Being the foodie that I am, Borough Market was a must during our visit. I was not disappointed. There are a variety of foods, so you can definitely find something to try. ||April 19, 2019
255marthapatriciad||50||What a tantalizing selection of food from all over the world awaits You here! You can sample the best tomatoes, cheeses, olive oil, homemade pasta and sauces a traditional artesian bread. Don't worry if you are vegan or vegetarian, this is paradise in one place. Lots of stalls and places to eat. Not too many open spaces were to the seat so you need to find a corner where to stand or try a restaurant which again there is a lot to choose from. It gets very crowded so may your personal possessions. I was mesmerizing yo see giants oysters and exotic vegetable beautiful displays. ||April 19, 2019
Thomas L||50||So many different stalls. Everything looked amazing. The few places we tried (falafel, baked goods, and turkish coffee) were all excellent. Only wish we could come back to try more!||April 19, 2019
karensR4862YT||50||Love this market so much it makes me want to live in London so I can do my shopping there! The fruit n veg is squeezed into one corner but looks amazing, a few unusual items for sale. There are numerous stalls for deli type items, cheeses, oils, pate, olives to name a few, all offering tasters. There are tons of stalls offering food to eat immediately, from paella to hog roast and everything in between. The market have even built a covered area for you to eat your lunch wherever you have bought it. If you’re there on a Friday or Saturday lunchtime you can watch a cooking demo by a random tv chef.It’s a very busy market, crammed with people every time we went through it.Love it. ||April 19, 2019
just r||40||The market is quite clean. Many store fronts have samples of olive oils, truffle oil, balsamic vinegar, cheeses. Compared to Victoria Market in Melbourne, this is significantly smaller. Very well connected by tube. Prices: exorbitant. Worth a trip. ||April 18, 2019
TanyaB2381||50||There is no chance to leave without tasting really good street food and buying a lot of goods, as all the market is just so attractive, and atmosphere is so nice, you want to taste it all||April 18, 2019
Nathalie M||40||Hi Borough market is great to taste Uk & int food-fish & chips from Fish eat in or take away, Indian, Thai, French, Italian, Baltic. Only just realised another side to it! Great for grocery shop as well. Also buskers & music. From there walk on to Southbank to see hinde, Pubs, Globe & Tate. Wonderful part of london. Borough market c’est super pour des cuisines du monde. Borough is super fuer Essen Von Uber all.||April 16, 2019
483Chris||50||Great place to wander for a couple of hours. Best to avoid lunch times as it’s too busy near the food stalls - go instead for breakfast or brunch.||April 15, 2019
Aninda_mukherjee||40||Bumped into the market by surprise while walking along the millennium bridge towards the London bridge station. Discovered the whole range of delicious food and raw material at this place. The meat shops are special to mention, although there are shops from all around the globe. Had a pulled pork shoulder wrap with white sauce from a local small shop, which turned out to be a Monday blower.Suggest a visit to this great market under the bridges of London. The brick building of the market also makes it very unique in design.||April 15, 2019
JezT41||50||We visited at lunchtime in Saturday. The place was packed but there was a huge choice of delicious lunchtime treats, as well as plenty of options for my vegetarian daughters. Definitely worth the bustle to view (and sample) the food on offer.||April 14, 2019
lepochka||50||I like such places when you are not sure what you want to eat. Here you choose something for sure. Moreover, you can buy some grocery and delicatessen to home.||April 14, 2019
Tony A||40||I really enjoyed Borough Market because there you can find all kinds of fruits and vegetables to various sausages to fish and chips and whatever else your palate may desire. Great fun to sit at tables with total strangers and strike up a conversation. Felt very safe wandering around the market.||April 14, 2019
Muirkurk||50||Borough Market is a uniquely buzzy market with lots on offer. Lots of unusual foods to choose from. Vegetables and herbs that you don’t usually see. For example real time turmeric, horseradish and much more.There is a great atmosphere and a mix of locals and tourists. Well worth a visit!||April 13, 2019
UKYork||50||Fantastic experience with so much amazing food and drink on offer from multiple different cultures. You would need weeks to get round all the stalls and try it all! A definite must-visit when in London. Good toilet facilities are available and there are a couple of large seating areas to enjoy your food purchases. Very close to London Bridge tube, so easy to get to.||April 13, 2019
Ibegonenow||50||We really enjoyed our meals and the ambiance of the restaurant. Can’t wait to go back and see more of Borough Narket but Fish! Was an excellent introduction! I recommend the fish and chips and the mushy peas were delightful. I say GO for it if you have the chance!||April 13, 2019
lol_hargs||50||The Borough Market is always hailed as a must see spot in London and it's quick to realise why. The atmosphere is always buzzing and the selection of both fresh and prepared food is vast. A visit sets your senses alight! Make sure to see all that's available before choosing what to eat and often you walk around the corner and wish you'd seen that first! And definitely go hungry!||April 13, 2019
848ade||40||Lovely Victorian covered market in Borough, one of the oldest parts of london. Main days are Friday and Saturday, so get there early, as it gets very busy. This place is all about food, so make sure you're hungry when you go! It's in a great area, next to London bridge and you've got Southwark cathedral, the clink, and the Golden Hind next door, within walking distance to Shakespeare's Globe theatre and Tate modern art gallery. Make sure you try out The Anchor pub on the river front close by.||April 13, 2019
RekhaRajkumar||50||Always a wonderful experience. Eclectic dishes from around the world.Best street food in London. The bonus is the variety of cheese, fruits, exotic vegetables, juices, sea food etc. Must visit.||April 13, 2019
Laurachapman32||50||We recently had a weekend in London for my birthday and the market was recommended to us. We got there late afternoon on a Saturday but it was still heaving with activity and vendors. We sampled various foods and then discovered Beefsteaks.....OMG!!! They were running low on steak and only had one sauce left but we queued anyway in the hope they’d get to us before selling out. I’m so glad we did!! We had steak and chips with a chimichuri sauce (or something like that). Holy smokes batman I’ve never had such a good steak! The flavour, cut, texture....wow. My partner and I were blown away and had they not have run out of steak shortly after they’d served us we would have gone back for seconds. Quite possibly the best £20 I’ve ever spent. The buzz around the market, the people and vibe were just great, of all the things we did in London that weekend this was possibly the highlight. I’d gladly drive another couple hundred miles just to go back to the market!! ||April 13, 2019
UK-Visitor99||50||Was there this morning. The smells in this place are amazing as you go from stand to stand. If you are a foodie, you must visit this place on a Saturday morning. Way better than a lot of London attractions. Easy to walk to. From St Pauls, walk south and over the Millennium bridge then go left for a few hundred yards and you can't miss it. Smell and the people will guide you.Best to go in the morning as it is very busy from lunchtime.||April 13, 2019
imagine666||40||Is amazing place for food. I've never seen so many kinds of different food at one place. You can not try everything, but you would. If you want to go there with kids, go early in the morning or dont, if you dont want to lose them. Sometimes is hard to go throw. ||April 13, 2019
Loren H||50||I've been to London many times - never before had I visited Borough Market. From now on, it will be one of my first stops!A delightful array of foods from around England and elsewhere. Too many stalls to mention, however, one was of particular interest to me - the one stall where they were shucking fresh oysters. 6 for 10 GBP. I did a combination...3 French and 3 English. Both delicious...I preferred the English..a bit more briny and 2x as big. Really enjoyed.||April 12, 2019
Catherine J A||50||Set yourself the challenge to eat your way around the world just by tasting the free gourmet samples on offer. Amazing fresh produce, cheeses, chocolates, cured meats, nuts and so much more. The opportunity to see the UK and Europe’s diverse menu under one roof made me realise how far away Australia is as there were things we’d never seen before. Wash it all down with fresh juice, teas, or a £4 glass of Prosecco. Be prepared to jostle with the crowds but all part of the charm. Jump back on the underground at London Bridge which is only a few steps away.||April 12, 2019
coconut_lips||40||It’s a beautiful market with a lot of things to eat. You can eat really different there. They have noodles,juices and fish and a lot more. ||April 12, 2019
Larry G||50||As a born and bred Londoner and having worked 40 years ago less than half a mile away, how did I not know of this place?An amazing spectacle of stalls selling great value produce with foodstuffs you will not ever find in local supermarkets. Tons of outlets selling cooked dishes to tempt the palette - absolutely wonderful.We were en-route elsewhere, so shopping was not really an option, but resolved to return armed with bags for a mega collection visit!||April 12, 2019
Grace239||50||A lovely, old fashioned food market. It’s affordable, and food quality is amazing. However, it was very busy and sometimes stalls are repetitive but it’s definitely worth the visit, I ate so much !! ||April 11, 2019
loupowrie77||40||We went to Borough Market after finding Camden Lock a bit too much for our younger girls.I thought this was a fab place. The smells, the selection of food and atmosphere was fab.You could find something delicious to eat here easily and freshly made!Was busy but not claustrophobic for us.Highly recommend||April 11, 2019
katiemarie1042||50||We found this wonderful market while wandering around London. There is everything you can think of to eat- being cooked right in front of you. Wander around, sample the food and pick a spot to grab a bite to eat. We ended up going there a few times because we loved the food so much.||April 11, 2019
Ailton007||50||Went on Friday around noon which was less busy than on the weekends. Such a great market in a cool location with view on Southwark cathedral and with enough space to roam along the food stalls offering fares such as Indian, Thai, French, Spanish, German and seafood in general, all tasty and delicious. Had 3 different dishes so come prepared which in this case means hungry! Close by are the Golden Hind (English galleon best known for her circumnavigation of the globe between 1577 and 1580) and Thames River or you can go the opposite direction and check out the Shard Quarter.||April 11, 2019
Stephen S||40||This is a great place to visit for lunch. We strolled through at lunch time after visiting the Tower Bridge and found a nice place to have fish and chips. We highly recommend.||April 11, 2019
EB1066||40||We happened upon these markets having miscalculated our tube stops! However would highly recommend a visit specifically for the markets. A wealth of food & drink available along with traditional London banter. Lots of samples to try! We used as a starting point before wandering towards the Globe Theatre.||April 10, 2019
chefdino||50||Always love to check out local markets to get the pulse of local food styles. We visited on a busy Saturday before St Patrick’s day, so there were a few Irish producers at the entrance foyer showcasing, seafood, beer & cheese. It was lively and packed with locals down for a bite of the many food stalls while procuring there treats for the evening dinner.||April 10, 2019
Trollet65||50||A relatively recent London favourite of mine. Situated under the railwaytracks close to London Bridge tubestation, it's a bustling market with both fresh produce and places to eat and drink. You can find almost everything edible here, fresh or prepared for take away or sit down meals. Colours, flavours, scents - I just love to browse here, have lunch, but the best Fudge or chili preserves to take home. Summertime I buy some bread, cheese and cake and go sit on a bench somewhere to eat.||April 10, 2019
ela03||50||We visited twice during our recent visit to London. Great range of food from all over the world. Artisan cheese, breads and alternate food stalls. Very clean, well kept food market with a great vibe. ||April 9, 2019
phathaua||50||Ssooo cool!!! Love the diversity in foods and they have samples at every station. Better than Costco sampling lol actually you cannot compare because the vibe and smells are just amazing! Try everything! lol ||April 8, 2019
NasusWM||40||Busy, bustling environment. Very interesting to wander round and enjoy the lovely smells of the different foods. Massive choice of produce, all looking beautifully fresh.||April 8, 2019
Kate28111972||50||A trip to Borough Market is always a pleasure, especially if it's lunch time! The place is full of amazing smells and food from every corner of the globe. I love the fact you can go as a group and everyone can buy food from different stalls and then sit together and get food envy lol! I didn't have any trouble deciding what to eat when I was there a few days ago. The pretzels on the Artisan Food stall actually called out to me! Golden, slightly shiny with bumpy salt crystals scattered over them. I could see, just by looking at them that they would be soft, slightly chewy and really tasty! I bought 2! 1 to have for lunch with an 'amazing' bloody Mary (from Whiskey Ginger, see review) and the other to reluctantly share with my husband and daughter on our way home. Pretzels are 1 of many many delicious baked goods these guys sell - squidgy brownies, crusty bread etc etc. All looked beautifully made and really good quality. My eyes were fixed on the pretzels and they didn't disappoint!! Say Kate sent you! :) your only regret will be if you only buy 1!! Enjoy!! ||April 8, 2019
adrianai2016||40||My friend and I walked around right when it opened. You can but fresh produce, meats and cheeses of any sort basically to cook at home, the market is lively. We sampled a little bit of sicilian olives, cheeses, pastries, authentic Colombian coffee and eventually after walking up and down the lunch options we had the classic fish and chips London experience and it was delicious. It is nice to start here and then walk to along the Thames to London & Tower Bridges, the Southbank area, etc. ||April 8, 2019
travelkat2570||50||If you like tooling around farmers markets then I highly recommend this market. It’s especially good on Friday mornings/midday as it is less crowded. There were lots of international street food vendors to grad a snack or lunch. It would have been amazing to be able to buy some fruit and cheese but we were just touring. It only takes an hour or so to visit and it’s easily accessible by the tube. ||April 7, 2019
SimonBest||40||Great market which I have been coming to for over a decade but does seem more commercial every time I visit. Good ecelctic mix of food stalls to suit all tastes. Get their early, say before 1000, to avoid the crush which would be difficult to navigate with young children.||April 7, 2019
Clayton C||30||It’s OK. If you’ve been to a typical farmer’s market, it’s supposed to replicate something like that. What I found was not all that impressive and high prices. I wouldn’t put this high on your must-do list of London. It’s really not that big.||April 7, 2019
bobcD8537PY||50||If you love food this is a great place for you. It has a ton of options and a good, lively vibe. Def Wirth a visit and it’s easy to get to.||April 7, 2019
MartinJ72||50||This is a food heaven place since I left London after living there for 6 years this is the place I come back to every time. I always start with the chorizo sandwich then I work my self up to different stalls and then go for a pitcher of pimms.. well you can spend the whole day and night.. can recommend this place, it’s a must if you love food.||April 7, 2019
antonio1353||40||If you enjoy street market places , you can't miss this venue. Always full of colours and attractive stalls. No way of getting bored!||April 7, 2019
travellinglifeofgina||50||Wow. This was my first time visiting Borough Market and I can honestly say I loved every moment of it. Be prepared for big crowds, hustle and bustle of a lot of people in and out of the market stalls. The choice of food, array of fish/meats/vegetables/spices and condiments was excellent! There are plenty of food stalls cooking fresh food. We chose the Thai food stall which served pad thai street noodles - the food was incredible! Very enjoyable, hot, tasty and well priced! I will definitely return again with the view to purchase the lovely items which are available. ||April 7, 2019
Karyn19||40||Love to stroll round seeing all the stalls and getting something to eat .Street food is good,buy something to eat while you carry on walking round||April 6, 2019
godsunchic||30||I did not find it special.Everything was slightly more expensive than other market in london. And it was overcrowded and there was not enough space to sit.But when it comes to food, there were various kinds of food like Korean, Indian, Japanese, German, Italian etcAlso the food was quite yummy and authentic.Yes, you can also try them before you buy them.You can buy various fruits and vegetables.If you want to go to a place where it is crowded and there is a wide variety of food, this market is for you.Alternatively, Camden and Greenwich markets could be your another option for you because everything is less expensive and cosier than here!Thank you. ||April 5, 2019
Tubi93||30||When you visit other markets in London, you know what to expect. However, this place is small and noisy due to the location (under a railway bridge), the staff are very hospitable and talkative. For example a middle-aged smoothie seller offered my friend and me a taste of his drinks before we’d bought one of them and we had a nice chat while we enjoyed these delicious healthy smoothies. Another plus point is I tried Balkan food which I hadn’t seen in other markets in London. They also have sitting opportunities which were decorated with pots and flowers which make the place more exotic.||April 5, 2019
Kounlattana S||40||There are plenty of shops in Borough Market especially homemade food such as cheeses, sausages, fruits, vegetables and so on…. Interesting, I found “pad thai” which is a traditional food from Thailand and the taste was incredibly delicious. I would recommend this stall for anyone who wants to try Asian food. Of course there are many restaurants and cafés, one of the most popular cafes that I went to is called “Monmouth”. It has quite a long queue and it’s a little bit crowded but, they have fresh homemade coffee and the bakery was excellent! So if anyone wants to visit any market in London I think Borough Market is one of the best decision.||April 5, 2019
pvdgp||30||What a market! Plenty of options for eating, the market not only includes lots of vegetarian stalls but also it sells lot fresh fruits. However, I didn’t like the architecture because it is located under a railway bridge, which makes the place a bit noisy. Also, the place was dirty and disorganized; they were not enough places to sit when we were going to eat. I would recommend you visiting Old Spitalfields Market, the architecture is better and bigger and has a much greater quantity of stalls, they sell pieces of art such as hand-painted pictures and models and clothes as well for a good price, in general, the place is friendlier, organized and with places you can sit.||April 5, 2019
bini7c||40||There are a lot of stalls and shops to buy any groceries you want! Like cheese, bread, fruits, coffee beans and also some dishes for example, paella, burgers, wraps, soup and Scotch eggs which I ate in the market. However, you can expect high prices and crowded premises as well. I’d recommend you don’t go to the market unless there was a specific item you could only get from there. Anyway, the tastes and smells are quite nice to travelers. Two places I want you to go near Borough market are Monmouth café and Padella. The café is famous for its flat whites and Padella is an Italian restaurant which is reasonably priced.||April 5, 2019
Joseph S||50||this market has everything that you can imagine. Meats and cheeses, jams candles pastries just on and on. come to shop for the day or week or just come to eat for the day. you have to be there to feel it||April 4, 2019
Shrey_bhandari||50||Amazing place to visit and it’s must if ur foodie , great place to eat and to relax and have couple of drinks ! Never miss ! ||April 4, 2019
TCarter14||50||Huge range of street food available - so great for grabbing something quick for breakfast or lunch. There are a large number of stalls and shops selling a variety of local and continental foods so there is something for everyone. Great place for inspiration. Ideally located next to London Bridge train and tube stations.||April 3, 2019
Csm00||50||This place is heaven for foodies! I have everything in here.Before I became vegan was my favourite spot and now that I'm vegan it continued to be my favourite spot! So much fresh food and great quality!||April 3, 2019
Janet M||40||Whatever you are looking for in the food or drink line I am sure you will find it here. From Turkish Delight to German Limberger, surely no one can be disappointed here. ||April 2, 2019
ppjkis||50||If your in central London & you’ve a few hours to spare. Then get the tube or bus to London Bridge station. There is a under cover market with food from every country in the world, you name it they’ve got it. You can put on a few pounds in weight, just by the numerous free tasting food offers. Lots of restaurants buy from there, but there quite happy to sell to walk in customers. It’s a great place to wander around for a few hours, free of charge.||April 2, 2019
Keionemaya||50||I really enjoyed wondering in this market. There are different types of variety of foods available and on offer. Also be aware it can be very busy in this market at peak times.||April 2, 2019
Campergirl4||50||We came to have a wander round one afternoon. There is lots to see and different types of food, drink and goodies. You can sample lots of them too. We treated ourselves to some amazing cakes and sat and watched a food demonstration whilst eating them. It is under cover, so would be fine to visit if it's raining too.||April 1, 2019
SergioLoco||50||Really enjoyed it, a very authentic market with good products and especially the best pulled pork I have ever eaten||March 31, 2019
lunalia||50||We wandered through here while sightseeing. It has a vibe apart from the rest of London. It’s busy, but moving. We had so much fun picking food from here and there and continuing our saunter through the market. Definitely glad we experienced it. ||March 31, 2019
Tim W||50||We walked up to this market after visiting the Tate Modern and really enjoyed our wandering about the place. Lots of sensory input !||March 30, 2019
278krisl||30||A very cool place, but just a soul crushing amount of people. I was there on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, and we were packed in like sardines, shuffling along, unable to even get close to the food vendors. We fought it and stayed and had some great food, but goodness.... it wasn’t much fun. I’d only go back if there were half the amount of people. ||March 30, 2019
mwschoon||50||I think Borough Market is my favorite thing to do in London. It's such a cool place to visit. The food is excellent and watching the market work is so much fun. I would recommend it to anyone visiting London. Great place for lunch but can get really crowded on Saturdays.||March 30, 2019
Flore N||50||Absolutely worth going. It is right outside London Bridge Station. So go have a look at the Tower Bridge for the view and then enjoy a fabulous array of street food... Delicious, well priced, right in the centre of London.We loved the atmosphere.Easily spend an hour there. ||March 30, 2019
570same||50||Ok this is a MUST if you’re ever in London! This place is heaven for foodie people. Everything is fresh and made right on the spot. The atmosphere is lovely. We ate here almost everyday we were there. IT’S CLOSED ON SUNDAYS, don’t forget! ||March 29, 2019
GBJ-Cookies||50||Passed through on our way to The Shard. Great place with a great vibe, such a diverse selection of foods to try. Most stall holders offer samples of their goods. The food on offer isn't cheap, but were else can you purchase live lobsters, truffles and seaweed gin. We visited around lunchtime and the place was packed. Whilst we were there the Met police had there dog handlers out with their dogs, meeting and talking to the public.||March 29, 2019
alilodd80||50||We stopped for a snack after visiting the Globe. There are so many wonderful food choices. The hardest part is choosing! If you love mushrooms, don’t skip the mushroom toast booth. It’s amazing!||March 27, 2019
blossombob||50||Visited here with my grown up son who lives in London. Bustling, vibrant, colourful and so much food to choose from. Bratwurst and sauerkraut, salt beef, pickles and beetroot in a bagel... food heaven. One of the places I miss after moving out of London but a pleasure to visit still.||March 27, 2019
santo19||40||It was a good experience. Nice place. Good food. . I reccomend a visit. I went in a saturday and although it was crowded and some stands runs off of some options, I liked ||March 27, 2019
dragonthoughts||50||The Borough Market is large. It specialises in top quality foodstuffs, from Truffles to French nettle cheese.You can order food from scallops to venison burgers when you want a snack. As they are cooked to order, you do have to wait a few minutes, though.An epicurean's dream.||March 27, 2019
cdavis37||50||The stalls were very nice and set up well. They had many different cultural foods. It was a great experience to try new things.||March 27, 2019
Experience236071||50||loads to see delicious food some great chocolates and chilli sauces to buy.Great spice stall with unusual spices I got some black garlic.||March 27, 2019
flaneur40||30||I had heard that this was a good place to get samples of food. Free nibbles. But the crowds were extraordinary. Some if it may be justified and much of the food may be excellent, but I just couldn't take the crowds and there is very, very little that is worth it to me to wait in line for an hour. That's time better spent walking the City and seeing things. It's worth experiencing but perhaps go early or later in the afternoon. Avoid from 11-2 at at all costs!||March 26, 2019
raymondf594||40||Pleasant setting, easily found. Good food, friendly atmosphere. This is a decent size outdoor market with additional stores and Resturant nearby.||March 25, 2019
mrsg2017||50||Great market for a wander around. Lots of different and exotic goods available. Comprehensive hot food market available. It gets very busy!||March 25, 2019
B B||50||This is the place to eat, especially if you enjoy having different portions from different vendors/cuisines. I found the Indian curry and samosas the best, but many others also look great.Try to avoid the busy lunchtime rush...||March 25, 2019
alexrM4968CU||40||Great place to visit if you are into your food and ingredients. Lots of characters and lots of world food, but also amazing to see so many high quality products from the UK.||March 25, 2019
Traveller75490||50||We stumbled on the Borough Market while walking along the Thames from Tower Bridge towards the London Eye..A great food market with lots of stalls and many various dishes on offer..You can happily find something for all tastes here.. well worth a trip if you’re hungry.. good photo opportunity too for some unusual shots!||March 24, 2019
Raymond L||50||I could happily wander around the market ALL day. It's got a great buzz and it just invites you to sample a HUGE range of foods and drinks. But beware; choose the right day or you'll get crushed by the many, many others who love this place. ||March 23, 2019
834davee||50||Great place to walk through, grab a bite to eat, and have a refreshing drink. Great place for everyone in your group to find something to try. Enjoyed the variety of food that was available.||March 23, 2019
John100353||40||We walked along the south bank of the Thames to the market, this place is heaven for street food, I don’t think I have ever seen so many different street food sellers anywhere else, the foods are from all over the world and the walking past these stalls you will soon be munching on some of its great food, this is well worth a visit.||March 23, 2019
doloresj169||50||I had spelt risotto, wild mushrooms, chives and parmesan, but the choices were infinite, something to excite every palate.||March 23, 2019
markh593||30||Don't worry about Fagin and his boys... the real pickpockets are the stalls!Clearly geared to foreign tourists without a clue about the values of produce...Don't get me wrong some of the produce is fantastic... smells, looks and tastes beautiful... but £8.50 for a punnet of Strawberries, £4 for 2 Figs on one stall... walk five minutes to the edge of the market 2 Punnets for £2!Fudge stall beautiful product... but at the prices charged I expect to be served by a band of naked virgins... FFS, I can buy double the quantity, hand made, for half the price on my local highstreet! They have a shop and overheads... you have a stall!||March 23, 2019
BonBons986||50||Busy but worth the visit if your patient. Lots of options with take away or small restaurants and pubs on the edges. Grab a bite and explore. Many different ethnicities and types of foods represented at decent prices. Most vendors take card but bring cash just in case. Also many vendors for specialty foods and items. ||March 22, 2019
Endymion1821||20||My visit was an intense disappointment. The Market attracts large crowds of people which restricts movement, not ideal when you have children with you. There is no doubt that the market has wonderful products, but it also has some mediocre products too which are over priced and offer poor value. There has recently been an increase in confectionery stalls, many offering similar products. The saving grace is "Maria's Cafe" which offers wholesome food at affordable prices. The ladies there are delightful. If you are on a mission to buy specific produce my advice would be to arrive early and move quickly. It starts to get crowded after 11.am. Not conducive to small children or any form of buggy. Good Luck!||March 22, 2019
sweetcheeks001||30||Asked the owner what a bbq chicken box consisted of as there were no descriptions, he was dismissive and pointed at the board that displayed a list of items for sale.....no explanations. Asked him again and he pointed to a wrap with rice, chicken and salad in it so I asked if you literally get that put into a box and he pointed to his signs again and said, can't you read the boards. Felt really disappointed at his rudeness.||March 21, 2019
j s||10||On a Wednesday lunchtime i visited with much anticipation, only to be bitterly disappointed. It was over crowed with tourists which is what the market now caters for not foodies. I went in ted's veg to find re-hydrated produce that was dripping with water and had seen better days. The market had no vegan options and was dirty, the cheese smelt overwhelmingly like feet and this was off-putting for the cheese lover with me!The best part was the water refill station on the edge of the market.||March 21, 2019
jezzerbee||30||First, probably only fair to say that on the day we visited the weather was awful - very strong winds that blew things from the stalls, heavy rain showers, interspersed with spells of sunshine - not really the kind of day to spend a couple of hours mooching around a partially covered market. Having wandered around the place I couldn't really work out the rather strange mixture of types of stalls. Without doubt, there is an amazing variety of stalls selling street food, with tables and benches to eat, and if you are looking for interesting street food you will be very happy! Apart from the street food there are many specialist stalls selling for example cheeses, herbs, spices, salts, vinegars, meats, wine - niche and generally expensive. As someone who likes cooking I think I was expecting something similar to the markets you see on travel/cookery programmes - and it wasn't like that at all. Wouldn't go there again unless I was in the area and wanted to sample some unusual street food.||March 21, 2019
Shelliu||50||A short walk from London Bridge, the Borough Market is a foodie’s paradise. You can purchase fresh oysters with a glass of champagne, sample aged cheese from around the world or local dry gin and much more. There are stands selling fresh meat, eggs and produce if you are in the mood to cook. And also vendors with prepared foods like spices, hot sauce, jams, jerky and dozens more. There is truly something for everyone. The market is quite busy around lunch and after so if you want to beat the friends, get there right when it opens. Because if the crowds and tight spaces, I don’t recommend bringing a stroller - I held my 1 year old daughter in a carrier on my chest and it was much easier to navigate and she was eye level so could see everything we did and she loved it! I have been to London dozens of times but never to Borough Market and now I feel that no trip to London would be complete without a visit.||March 21, 2019
8Melbourne123||50||This market is very much worth a visit while in London. The street food was really good and lots of people handing out samples so you can try things first before you decide what you want to eat. We went to both Camden and Borough and there was no comparison, this was heaps better||March 21, 2019
BusyWorkerBee||50||Go with an empty stomach on Saturday. It’s crowded but all stalls are in full operation! Oysters, sea urchins, grilled scallops are not to be missed in the seafood section. Then there is wild mushroom risotto in the produce section. Then steak and chips, salted beef, German bratwurst ... the list goes on and on.||March 20, 2019
ZenHealer7||30||There are many other markets in London that are far more interesting and varied than this one. The chooices here are very limited. There is hardly any fresh produce and the options for normal people is very limited. Most of the stalls are geared for carnivores.||March 20, 2019
74Tonyk||50||Wonderful market best in London Smashing food , fresh food, and great vibe throughout Been lots of times Highly recommended||March 20, 2019
Alicia S||50||The market is a must do if you want different foods. Food was prepared quickly, paella, breads, fruits! Area is clean and pleasant to walk around. Reasonably priced. Went back twice in 5 day visit.||March 20, 2019
Eveaparis||40||I had never seen so many food options in one place! Quaint French cheeses, delicious scandinavian pastries, pub grub, cheesecake extravaganza, italian truffle oil, English veal sandwitchs, noodle bar, Bread Ahead's famous doughnuts, fresh lemonade and so much more. Really tough to make a choice without feeling regrets for all the other delicious choices. Make sure to come when the "real" market is open as well to see beautiful produces.||March 20, 2019
JEFFREY G||50||This market has many specialist stalls for such items as cheese, game, Manx kippers etc. Honey, cakes, coffee beans, chocolate and many other tastes are catered for. However there are now many tourists and office workers that use the many fast food stalls to purchase their lunch and on the London Bridge entrance there is an area that has been set aside with benches for people to eat if they need to sit down. Of course there are many restaurants and pubs for those requiring a more formal eating experience.||March 19, 2019
Charles C||50||We were there literally for the street foods. Endedup eating cheese and drank wine, also had the oysters and giants scallops||March 19, 2019
Lou C||50||Near London Bridge's tube station, Borough market offers a wide variety of street food and stalls. Great oysters and champagne as well. You can buy ultra fresh fish and meat as well. Definitely recommended.It is located near a beautiful two beautiful churches in a lovely area near the river Thames.||March 19, 2019
Mitchell H||50||Come early to experience a true foodies paradise. There are some standard fare items but there are an overwhelming number of vendors with unique items for purchase (and to taste or smell). If you come later (after 11:30) it tends to become extremely crowded so arrive early and walk around in an open space.||March 19, 2019
PeripateticJunkie||40||With a family of 5, kids ranging from 10-16 sometimes it's hard to make everyone happy. Not at the Bourough Market! Everyone got to have exactly what looked good to them! We had Scottish eggs - they were devine, a definite must if u go to the market. We had a duck sandwich, pulled pork & macaroni cheese, smoothies, donuts, and all kinds of pastries. Also the best cup of coffee I had in all if London at The Change (I think that was the name). The company not only makes a great cup of Joe, but changes the world too. The help homeless people learn to be baristas so that they can make a better life for themselves! Now that a win, win!!I will say it is crowded so protect your belongings. There are not a lot of places to actually sit and eat as it's more designed as street food you eat and walk. Bathrooms were few and far between, but are there and free if you ask. All in all we loved it so much, we ate lunch went on a tour and came back later for dessert! Sorry there are not more pics, but we were too busy eating too take photos!||March 19, 2019
StephenCr0ss||50||Fantastic for tourists and locals and always something going on in the area. Great buzz when all the stalls are in full swing. Recommended. ||March 19, 2019

shadowoftheshard||50||I am the luckiest girl in the world to live so close to this London treasure! Whether you are a tourist or a local you can come here and buy the freshest produce or the tastiest street food. My must buys here are some lovely French cheese, some award winning olive oil, bread ahead bread and some amazing vegetables at Turnips. The Ginger Pig is also a must visit if you are looking for a good butcher or if you are just looking for a GREAT sausage roll. ||March 19, 2019
themackayfamily156||50||This market has a fantastic variety of fresh vegetables, fruit, fresh cooked food as well as preserves and relishes and a whole lot of other creative items.. I enjoyed the buzz and bustle - without being too overcrowded - and the food we tasted was delicious. All this, together with Its situation gave the impression of being in an exotic foreign country.||March 19, 2019
marktI5931VY||50||I've been going here for the best part of 20 years and it never disappoints. So much food to explore from so many countries and all such good quality.To be honest you do pay for the privilege by and large but overall it's worth it for the quality, flavour and variety and worth a visit.My favourites include the Boston Sausage Company (no preservatives in their sausages, our kids have grown up on them) Brindisa, Neal's Yard Dairy and the awesome Italian delis that sell n'duja! There are fantastic salamis from around Europe including the UK and bread that is second to none. You can buy almost any type of food to eat there and take home so eat, drink, browse, chat, eat some more - go there hungry and go away happy.||March 18, 2019
Coopedycoops||30||Had a visit late afternoon having been around 7 years ago. Cant help feeling it's getting a bit too precocious and losing it's way a little. Did get a few bits but you need to be careful. Worth a visit, but not as good as it used to be.||March 17, 2019
Aveyron13||50||Found Borough Market through reviews, some of which left me in two minds…...glad I decided to visit :-) We went on a Saturday morning, just as it opened…..great to see the market come alive, but quite a few of the food stalls were only just getting going so would recommend a slightly later in the day visit. Super catacombs of stalls…..chesses, cold meats, breads, cakes & pastries, sauces & herbs, hot food of various countries….. great to wander and watch…..but impossible not to eat! Found a good stall that made fresh juices for a bit of additional morning energy…...located within a stones throw of the Shard if wanting to combine visits?||March 16, 2019
Polishedstone||10||What a dump! Foodie heaven? There’s a new smell on every corner and each is more nauseating than the last. It’s overcrowded and oversold. Stick to Camden! At least there you can get food and other bits of shopping too! Awful place!||March 16, 2019

Happyamit||50||Spoilt for choice at this absolute foodies paradise. Went to have a late breakfast but it took me so much time to decide what I wanted that ended up having lunch. Settled for the scallops followed by the fish and chips. The Paella and Risotto were vying for a close 2nd place. ||March 12, 2019
Travelingwifey0308||50||We watched you tubes on this place and they were all spot on! Several amazing food choices all freshly made and full of flavor. We split a chorizo sandwich fro Brindisa that was delicious and a Duck confit sandwich that was to die for. We went to this market three days while we were in London Andy only missed Sunday because it’s closed. They have fresh oysters and seafood, meat pies, cheeses, fruits, and truly have someth8ng for everyone! It was always crowded, you can tell it’s a favorite for tourists and locals.||March 12, 2019

HelloFolks||10||There is a lot of hype over this market, but in truth it is simply an awful market and does not compare to the larger markets abroad that are vibrant and better organised in the most engaging premises and surroundings. This market is in the most chaotic and unhygienic premises, no tiles on the ground, no lovely clean tiles on the walls, paint is not just peeling off the walls but black with filth, and cobwebs here and there, and with food being sold directly beneath. They should had made the premises beautiful before allowing traders to set up their stalls. Moreover, traders are cooking and serving food without their hair covered up, and various fresh bakes uncovered. In addition, this market is ridiculously expensive, for example one lemon cost 60p and yet there are independent grocery shops in north London that sell lovely lemons for 10 for a £1.00, a doughnut at this market cost £3.00 each when you can pop anywhere and buy a whole packed of doughnuts for £1.00 without a difference in taste, everything in this market is just as overly expensive. It's sad because they are outsmarting their customers. and there are customers who wrongly believe that they are buying quality at this market all because they are expensive. The surrounding area of this market is dreary. If people want to get excited about food whether independent grocery shops, food markets or lovely restaurants and coffee shops they should travel to north London one stop is Haringey and the other area is Palmers Green, both food heaven areas and affordable as well. As for Borough Market, it could become something special if it is completely refurbished without the silly high prices, very doubtful the latter will ever happen.||March 11, 2019

Come for lunch, for your shopping, or just a cool place to hang out. Home to some of the best street food you can find. One of the highlights of London for sure.||March 11, 2019
791HelenA||40||Want to visit the market for some time chose a Sunday not the best choice as the rest of London were also there! Great foods cheese fish etc although the veggies stall were very ordinary. Great for looking over priced but that's to be expected. Something for everyone. Best visit on weekdays I would think||March 11, 2019
cazbatt||50||There’s a problem with Borough Market..... deciding what to eat!! The market is great with lots of lovely food and drink to buy from usual fruit and veg to speciality food - I particularly love the Croatia stall and pate moi. I bought My lunch at Eat Chay (vegan) - a very busy oriental stall, I had the bbq Korean bimbipim (I think that’s what it was called) and it was divine.It was a jam packed Saturday afternoon I visited and it took some getting round but was a great atmosphere.||March 10, 2019
freetime_CB||50||Spent a great time grazing around the food heaven that is Borough Market. Why travel abroad to get a taste of international cusiine when it is all here - had paella, german sausage and bought a strange looking fish to take home - wonderful.||March 9, 2019

Fiona M||40||We wandered around here on a wet weekday morning. It was busy but very interesting. It is a food market.There is so much on sale here, fish, meat, vegetables, coffee, sweet goods. I saw food here that I was not familiar with at all There are lots of stalls selling food to eat too as well as coffee shops and restaurants close by. It is close to the Cutty Sark if you go here which is worth a view too.||March 8, 2019
Jencheltenham||50||Don’t go to London and not experience this fantastic market. It has it all. Eating, drinking, shopping, people watching. The sights, smells and sounds are just wonderful ||March 8, 2019
AmolakRattanK||50||In close proximity to the London Bridge, this market is a must visit for any tourist or visitors. You get everything related to food. You need to have extra stomachs to do justice to this place.Amolak Rattan Kohli Former Governor of Mizoram||March 7, 2019
JonDoe04134||30||A more civilised market, but the choice of food is much more limited than in e.g. Camden. Still ok though and in a very good location next to the London Bridge||March 7, 2019
MadalynH7||40||A delightful foodie market with a number of stalls selling a wide variety of fresh foods including meat, fish and vegetables. A little touristy and can get crowded, but still great fun.||March 7, 2019
Michelle R||50||I could have eaten here every day of our trip. I wish we had more time to explore all the amazing food places. I am not a Harry Potter fan, but my sister in law recognized some of the buildings from the movies.||March 7, 2019
MULCASTER2||50||Just visit and you too will be hooked. No way could any trip to London not involve this culinary hot spot in this fabulous City ||March 7, 2019
-Miss-Williams-123||50||The first time I went to borough market I was visiting a friend in London as she took me as part of the tourist trail. I now live in London and I love the place just as much. The choice of food is incredible and the standard is sky high.Some handy little things have changed since my tourist days. The stalls now accept card payments and there are lots of water refilling stations.Good to go alone or with friends, and if you don’t eat too much, you didn’t have the true experience!||March 6, 2019
clari98||50||It’s a great place to eat, very well located and you have a million options to choose. I loved all the little shops, everything looked fresh and delicious.||March 6, 2019
stevejen2016||50||Visited here with friends who had visited several times in the past. Very busy and a great atmosphere in the market. An excellent variety of all types of food and produce. Many of the stalls are happy for you to sample the items being sold. Some stalls on the pricier side but as the saying goes you get what you pay for. If in the area it has got to be worth a visit.||March 4, 2019
brandonv922||10||Can barely walk here unless you real scrawny. The workers there so poor to serve you food takes like 30min to get something.||March 4, 2019
michelle O||10||We booked a table for dinner for two , I was surprised when we arrived that no one took out coats , nor was there facility to hang - you had to either have it the back of your chair , dragging on the floor or crumpled up somewhere . The menu was presented- paper copied, quite dogeared, clipped to a board. I had to unclip the whole lot to read it properly. We ordered G&T's only for the waiter to come running back to say 'we don't stock Gordon's. He should have known what;s on offer. We ordered alternatives,which the waiter placed on the table incorrectly. He did ask who ordered 'Little Bird' and then placed the tonic waters incorrectly. I had to rectify , to which he said' Oh, I put it upside down!' never mind apologising for getting ti wrong. We waited quite some time to have our order taken, when the lady finally came , she made an excuse sating 'the table next to us are regulars, so she was busy - too busy to serve us ! We had made our selection, only to be told after we chose that the skate wing was out. So we had to make another choice. I though this was really poor - she should have told us sooner that our choice was out . I also find it disappointing that skate wing appears in three different places on the menu , but they have such a limited supply - it was not even 8.30. We made another selection from a quite limited menu , the food was nice enough when it came. We ordered dessert, when it arrived, I had not been given a spoon! But the girl had run off again, whiteout checking if all was in order . There is nothing worse than having to shout and wave across a restaurant trying to to catch the attention of staff who are doing everything in their power to ignore you . When I finally managed to catch her attention and ask her how I'm supposed to eat this , she rudely replied ' The bar staff should have brought you a spoon! How RUDE ! I'm not responsible for your bar staff , who don't know their cocktails, and to hold me responsible for not having cutlery is disgusting - I was really offended. I would not recommend Fish!||March 4, 2019
TerryE107||50||Although always crowded, Borough Market is a must see destination in London. The stalls, structure, variety and quality are excellent, with some great places to eat and drink around and about. Have been to better overall markets in Europe (Madrid, Lisbon, Barcelona) but as a food market, this stands the test and wish it were on our doorstep!||March 3, 2019
P4579FVkeithr||50||First visit to borough market and will be back for sure. Easy to find from London Bridge tube station. Suggest early arrival as gets packed when the tourist numbers are swelled by the local workers at lunchtime. I imagine it’s packed all year round. Great selection of fresh food to take home, plus food cooked on the spot to eat now....oysters, mussels, cheeses, meats, vegetables...something for all tastes and pockets. Great pubs too!! ||March 3, 2019
185tracyf||40||This was our first visit to this lovely market and far better then a famous Northern market. I can say this as I’ve visited both, black pudding or not Borough Market is stacks above it. As you enter from the London Tube station end you are enthused by an ornate tunnel with street art all around. It is sectioned into areas, cheeses, spices, meats, fishes, bakery etc. The stalls are well stacked with their wares and entice you to try and then buy. We were highly delighted to see a Free From stall with a great selection of various allergy free cakes and slices. Yes you pay highly for their goodies but the taste is sensational. We bought a date and banana slice, a raspberry, pistachio and rose water cake and a carrot cake all of which were mouth-wateringly good. The cheeses stallls had a great selection of cheeses you may not have tried before and they are there to offer their advice as to what you could eat them with. Next to one of these cheese stalls was an Italian stall selling salami and a variety of balsamic oils. We bought an Apple Balsamic one for our son and his wife as they married in the Adelphi coast last year, and we’re sure it will bring back happy memories for them. The take away food stalls were very busy, with ques well down the streets. Again nothing comes cheap, but this is a treat so why not wonder and find your foreign area of delight and eat one of their well known dishes. There are plenty to choose from. The only area we found it lacked were seating areas. Yes they had tables and chairs there, but no where near enough. Bins could also be increased, we saw a few bins, all of which were overflowing and garbage been blown out of them into the streets. Not a good look. All in all well worth a visit.||March 3, 2019
Rebecca M||40||Lots of ‘artisan’ products and nice breakfast foods on a Saturday morning. Expensive for other UK places but similar prices to nearby equivalent food.||March 3, 2019
Colincfc||50||While staying in south bank we headed to borough market, amazing place selling food from all over the globe, the buzz is amazing & so many stalls, you’ve got to head here while in the capital||March 3, 2019
MancDaddy||50||Visited for lunch last week rather than boring conference lunch on a training course. Super cool vibe, loads of variety, friendly stall holders - not the sort of faceless London experience you find in most parts of London. Picked up an amazing salt beef bagel for £6, 6 quid for lunch in London, you’re having a laugh!? It was epic...||March 3, 2019
LondonTraveller848||50||We have been visiting Borough Market for years, we love to go and try the various foods and also stock up on top quality ingredients.So for example, we tried the wild mushrooms stall, where the staggering aroma of the beautifully freshly cooked wild mushrooms did not allow us to go past without having a taste, Delicious!Our friends had fish and chips and loved it. We also tried some pastries and bought some fresh produce.When we go overseas we love to visit food markets but Borough Market is very unique because it allows to buy your food, freshly cooked, right then and there. Whether a local or a tourist and regardless of age, Borough Market is a unique enjoyable experience. Walking along the various stands and stalls, a feast to the eyes and belly. The prices are reasonable, there are loads of coffee shops and pubs and restaurants, ample opportunities, just go with an open mind.A highly recommended activity.||March 3, 2019
Dowley||50||What a wonderful market with so many different stalls! Great atmosphere and very busy even on a Friday.||March 3, 2019
Mummypopof2||50||First time here and I loved it! So many stalls with delicious food on offer. The fresh fruit and veg stalls looked so good. Wish I had a market like this where I live. We visited early Friday lunchtime and it was very busy which obviously makes for long queues. However, worth the wait! ||March 3, 2019
TravelinTeresa84||50||Make sure you come with an empty stomach and a shopping bag/pack. This is was great place to pick up lunch from one of the many ethnic food vendors, beautifully displayed food to bring home to cook, or grab snacks to eat on a train ride. We did all three. Plenty of options. We spend about an hour here sampling buying foods to share and sample.||March 3, 2019

jaclynl323||50||I love borough market. It’s always fun to walk around and see what everyone has to offer. There are a lot more cheese stalls than I remember. ||February 26, 2019
Kornell||50||Plenty of choices to eat, from english to ethiopic, passing through german and chinese, and tasty food. Very crowdy, even in mid-week, both locals and tourists. However, the prices are high for street food (7-12 pounds for a sandwich, 5 pound glass of beer) - mainly due to touristic aspect. I suggest go to M&S market nearby to buy 2 beers or a Coke and then go to eat - especially that there are almost no seated places||February 26, 2019
paul274Boston||50||Friendly staff, terrific food, great energy.... yes its a little touristy, but going to FISH is something I've done for years and its still amazing food. ||February 26, 2019
ninska_10||50||Fresh produce - got it. Fresh fish - got it. Interesting wines - got it. Different spices - check. Fun street food - oh yeah. Borough Market has it all. Aiming to eat British - go to Fish! for the traditional fish and chips. It's amazing - and that is NOT an overstatement. It does get crowded, so aim for earlier in the day to avoid crowds. We went in Feb - mid-day on a Sat - and it was certainly busy. I'd imagine mid-week would be better. ||February 25, 2019
oanasimtion||50||AMAZING! I literally lost it the first time a friend of mine took me there. There are so many food options you regret not having a stomach 10 times larger.I ate the most delicious vegan burger ever. It's very crowded but the overall vibes is great. I spend 20 minutes just looking at craft beer packaging. Totally recommend going there.||February 25, 2019
Kathydave||50||We loved walking around the market on Feb 23... amazing toastie place.Had great rhubarb cider and mulled wine.Bought pate. So many great kiosks!We could have spent all day here .It’s a must see and our visit didn’t scratch the surface.We will definitely return.||February 24, 2019
sciencechicky||40||Borough Market is essential for foodies, showcasing a wide range of fresh vegetables, meat, fish, bread, cheese and other gourmet produce. Get there early at the weekends (9am) if you don't like crowds. As it heads to lunchtime, the queues for the freshly cooked street food get very long! It can be pricey, so don't go overboard!||February 24, 2019
timhdronfield||40||Borough Market had a great vibe to it, with a variety of interesting stalls selling all kinds of things. A great place to explore.||February 24, 2019
victorias369||50||I regularly go to Borough Market to buy bread from a lovely bread stall called Karaway Bakery who sell the greatest selection of sourdough, rye bread and brioche in the Market. Their stall had moved today from its usual place and so whilst looking for them, (I had travelled especially all the way from Forest Hill to buy bread from Karaway!), I came across the Olivier Bread Stall. I carefully picked up a sourdough to purchase it, there were no visible signs saying do not touch and handed it to the person behind the counter. Another man working there was extremely rude to me and said in a sneering voice This is not self service. He was bordering on verbal aggression. I said I’m sorry what did you say and he repeated himself. I told him he had lost the sale and he said you have to buy the bread now. I said No I don’t! The whole experience was very very unpleasant and really spoiled my trip. So I recommend that this is not a nice stall to do business with - very rude person with no customer skills. I have had a successful retail business for 20 years and I would not dream of treating a customer like that.So a thumbs down for “orrible Oliviers”Wouldn’t give them my money as I would expect common courtesy.The Market is really lovely with a great choice of really nice products and stall holders. Only one other thing I didn’t like was a mass of live lobsters all piled on top of one another in a small tank at a fish stall, that was horrible these poor creatures had no room to move and the ones at the bottom must have been suffering a lot they could not get out and not one lobster had room to move, there were at least fifty in there. At least...So an interesting bread run today.... oh and a brilliant stall hold for chutneys and stuff is Pimento Hill really lovely Caribbean stall and beautiful stuff gorgeous chill bonnet jam ||February 23, 2019
letmebeme||40||What a delightful place to spend a couple of hours. The array of food and market vendors was mind boggling. If I had had a bigger appetite or not concerned with carrying back 10 pounds of edibles in my suitcase, I'd could have easily spent more money and time there. I had my "must have" fish and chips there. It is a covered area, but no walls so anticipate whatever the temperature is outdoors. Also, there is a restroom there.||February 23, 2019
503JonG||40||This place has to be visited when in London, the hustle and bustle of the market with lots of amazing places to eat and drink ... soak up the atmosphere ||February 23, 2019
Travellover6128||50||We had a fabulous morning here, wondering through the food stalls and sharing a variety of dishes. We arrived fairly early on Saturday when it wasn't that busy. Although by the time we left 2 hours later it was packed. Would definitely recommend arriving earlier to have a more pleasant experience.||February 21, 2019
Steve G||50||This market is amazing. Food heaven. Dozens of stalls selling all sorts of brilliant and tasty food. Cannot recommend it high enough - whenever I'm in London I will try and make time to visit and stuff my face with something new here.Very easy to get to - London Bridge tube station is almost next door and there are several excellent pubs nearby to wash down the food afterwards.||February 21, 2019
Food4gods||50||Absolutely love this place! The sight and sound gives me a warm feeling of love. The fruits are cheap and the many samplings available simply make this place a fun place to hang around. All the local produce are good and the bakery school tucked at a corner simply make this place addictive.Go and mesmerized.||February 20, 2019
Chow_TW||50||So this market is reached from London Bridge station and there's really alot of stores and food to cover! From fresh produce to cooked bites and restaurants, this market is rather artisan and can be pricey for those on a budget. That said, dont scrimp on the opportunity to try the food here. I'm thankful to have done thatWandering around to the sights, sounds and smells of the market is a great way to start or end your trip in London and a reflection of how international this city is. Be sure not to miss this!||February 20, 2019
JenniferN1957||50||Cannot say enough about this place. Even if you don’t want to buy anything, just browsing around is an experience in itself! You definitely will find it difficult to pick what you want because of the amazing selection. Very good for health foods and vegetarians also.||February 20, 2019
Tigger1013||40||Soak up the atmosphere of this place it is amazing! I never really buy anything as I don't live in London but love coming here just to feel the great vibe. If I was looking for some amazing ingredients for cooking however this must be the place to come although slightly expensive they do seem to have some amazing fruit, veg, cheese and fish.||February 19, 2019
LightFighter||50||My wife and I stopped in at the Borough Market late one morning after walking over the Tate. The entrance is tucked away on a cozy lane and doesn't look like much form the outside. But enter the market and you will be amazed at the colorful displays and amazing variety of foods. The cheese section alone is worth the trip!A wonderful atmospheric market with e long history. This is one of the best places in London to people-watch.||February 18, 2019
cbnelly||50||This was a beautiful market. I was just immersed in all the fresh produce and home made goods. I could have explored here for ages ||February 18, 2019

annabG7814RP||50||Definitely worth visiting. Great food, friendly people and unforgettable exprience. You should definitely try some specialities, burgers and mac'n'cheese were awesome!||February 17, 2019
keithc601||50||Whether you are a tourist or a local, the Borough Market is a wonderful way to spend the afternoon. Go hungry, and plan to eat at multiple booths. Don’t plan for a large dinner the evening after you plan to go. It would be a shame to hold off on enjoying the culinary delights that the market has to offer. I have made the same mistake my last two trips to the market. I approach from the Thames river side and struggle against the crowds descending down the gradual slope. This time, I bailed out on a side street, and made my way to the Uphill side, at the junction of Southwark St and Borough High St. This approach seemed to move in better flow with the people. It also provides a means to work your way from moderate to high people density without feeling immediately overwhelmed. Starting from the Thames side and moving up, you are plunged immediately into the highest population density that the market has to offer. Don’t let the long lines at some food stalls put you off. The line is long because the food is good. The lines also move quite quickly. My favorite is the German Bratwurst. Outstanding - albeit I cringe when people order them with curried ketchup. German mustard only if you please, sauerkraut if you must, but ketchup? Never! But the folks at the stand accommodate all without external judgement. OK - humor aside, they graciously accommodate all requests. Get a bottle of water early, before you start trying different foods. Most of the stalls don’t offer beverages.Take your time on diving into the dishes. They are right off the fire and very hot. On past trips, most of my friends came away with blistered mouths. I was surprised at the number of baby strollers that people brought and heard a dew lamenting the experience. It may be worth a quick, solo buzz by the market to see if that experience is what you are expecting.Prices are quite good, and quality is quite high. You can see the cooperation between vendors, using each other for the freshest and quality ingredients. I do wish that someone would open a pasta food stall next to the one that sells fresh truffles. The dairy stand with fresh butter is also already there. Tagliatelle with browned butter and truffles. Yum - that would likely be my favorite new stand.||February 17, 2019
Jonnytwosocks||50||Visited the market during a weekend trip fromDubai. Love the place. Great vibe, lots of good food, great pubs,and it has that cockney feeling. Good location and easy to find. If visiting London make sure you go ||February 16, 2019
1bellner||50||The market is amazing, like any large city with an historic farmers market, this one is massive and has something for everyone.. if you’re planning a trip - know that Saturday is the best and busiest... get there early and maybe skip breakfast - you’ll be eating a lot..The stalls are great you can virtually try anything before you order - but do some research on the sit down restaurants in and around the market... for example Padella a hugely popular Italian restaurant had a line of over 100 people queuing up at noon... So if you really want to hit one of their more famous restaurants be prepared to wait..||February 16, 2019
galarowesetz||40||This is a wonderful combination of exquisite street food and lovely shops with fresh produce and the most delightful smells! Definitely a place to go||February 16, 2019
lloydm1987||50||Borough market is a great stop for foodies looking for something good to try in London. It can be a bit overwhelming, but a good stop for a tourist.||February 16, 2019
Rose S||50||My advice - go here on your first day in London, stock up, and make all your own lunches/snacks from the amazing stuff you can get here. Definitely get pasta at Padella if you have time to line up - it was totally worth it for me.||February 15, 2019
Lane-English||50||The noise and the smells here are amazing. Lots of stalls selling a variety of different things. Nearly everyone I saw was eating. Lots of choice. I loved the sound of the train overhead. Such a great character of a market.||February 15, 2019
DhennverNg||40||It's great place to be away from the hustle and bustle of this busy city. You can get a good array of food, cheese and produce. Be sure to come by for lunch if you are looking around the tower bridge, millennium bridge.||February 15, 2019
LCPUSA||50||I went several times to the Borough market during my stay in London. It is, to begin with, a real and live market for fresh products, but they have a little of everything over there. I think they excel on the street food. There are several carts selling different food. I specially liked the meat pies I ate there. There are restaurants too in the borough market. After you finish with it, explore the area around. The Borough market is just at the other side of the river from the Tower of London.||February 15, 2019
rivbom||50||Took my daughter here for her first visit, my 2nd time, for lunch. Loads of fabulous choices but I already knew what I wanted, so we both had a mixed sandwich from Gastronomica - salami, Gorgonzola and salad - accompanied by a pint of mulled cider from nearby The Cider House.It was all blimmin’ delicious and we LOVED it.We’ll be back.||February 15, 2019
Janeybugz||40||Never seen so many different types of mushrooms. Love the fish stall, amazing offerings. A must visit Market.||February 14, 2019
Kaela P||50||We loved walking around Borough Market. It's close to the London Bridge tube station and easy to get to. The market itself seemed smaller than we expected but it was still full of many delicious options for lunch. We visited on a cold, rainy day, so the warm food was more than welcome. There was a wide variety of cheese, pies, sweets, pastries, and many other options. We sampled a meat pie and a variety of macarons and pastries to take home, and loved it all. Definitely worth checking out to find a few snacks!||February 13, 2019
HeidiandJohn||50||A great way to find awesome local vegetables and other market items. Fun pubs, wine bars, and good restaurants in every nook and cranny. Easy walk across London Bridge or over to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre||February 13, 2019
Limenas||30||I tried food from many stalls (yes, I eat a lot) and my conclusion is that most of what is offered is substandard, badly cooked and not particularly tasty. I was going to give a 2 star rating but gave 3 stars to take into account ambience plus the possibility that within all that junk, somewhere there might have been some well cooked delicacies. (which I did not find!!)||February 13, 2019
Melissa L||40||Great place to go for lunch or to pick up ingredients to bring home. They are not open late, so plan ahead. ||February 13, 2019
Terry J||50||Being so close to London Bridge Station and between me and some of my customers I often find myself detouring through the Market. It never fails to make me feel ravenous and I often pick something gorgeous to eat on my way back through.At the weekend you can often find some entertainment going on and the sheer quality and variety of the offerings will satisfy the most demanding foodie!If you are a meat eater do seek out the pulled pork rolls which are simply delicious. You can also find the house front that was used as Bridget Jones' residence in the film within the Market precincts.||February 13, 2019
Alison M||40||A lot of people go here for lunch and there are a lot of market stalls providing for this, with a wide range of international dishes. So, for hot snacks and meals, there is a great selection. On the downside, it is busy, and you need to queue for most choices. And when you have bought your food, there isn't anywhere near to sit and eat in comfort - you really do need to take a walk , although the river bank is quite scenic and nearby. Also, I thought the prices were quite high. Evidently, this market lunch trade is profitable.||February 13, 2019
Matt A||50||My wife & I had a couple of hours to spend on a Friday afternoon just before Xmas so decided to wander around Borough Market. The atmosphere is great, very cosmopolitan. There are all sorts of stalls, our favs being the ones where you can dip things in and try chutneys, mustards, breads and especially cheeses, of which there are many wonderful types. We came away with 3 cheeses and some Italian sausages. The street food is amazing too, with varied cultures and palettes catered for. All in all, a really fun way to spend a couple of hours.||February 12, 2019

The selection of fresh produce and delicious hot food there is incomparable to anywhere else in London.I would recommend you stop at the Big V for the best vegan burger you'll ever have, the vegan indian dosa stand, and the vegan passion fruit cheesecake stand.Enjoy :)||February 12, 2019
Aria818||40||This market is located in a very old and interesting part of London with lots of other attractions nearby.It is agood place for lunch between sightseeing locations. Huge choice of food plus fresh,organic produce on various stalls. Full of young, trendy people who are into eating well with good quality produce. This market is very much part of the London scene and a tourist attraction.Gets very busy.||February 12, 2019
maziahstapah||40||The market is not too big but enough for you to try varieties of fresh produce such as the fruits and vegetables. Love the daily baked breads and cakes on sales, especially Bread Ahead bakery and Ion pattisarie. Those looking for hot food, at the back end of Borough Market (near the Southwark Cathedral) offers plenty of warm, comfy street food from all over the world, from Indian roti, Singapore laksa, Italian mushroom risotto to Ethopian ingera, they have it all.Contactless payment is possible at some stalls although a number of still accept cash only. It can get pretty crowded on Saturday as that's the only day on the weekend it's open, with most of the shops/stalls closed on Sunday.||February 12, 2019
chrissI668IE||50||Enjoy walking around eating my way through the Borough Market. Make a morning of visiting the market and work from one end to the other. Skip breakfast and stroll through with the deliciousness on offer. ||February 12, 2019
dianewW6211ON||50||Great market atmosphere with stalls selling the most amazing food. Nice trendy cocktail bar and traditional bars surrounding...real London feel||February 12, 2019
Luxtraveller69||50||Fantastic selection of top quality produce. Delicious cheeses. Wonderful truffle ravioli. Great Asian and German street cooking. Well worth a visit on a Saturday||February 12, 2019
Rosalind H||40||The bustle of this very popular market is exciting. Food stalls and fresh produce abound. Artisan breads, olives and a fabulous selection of cheese.I like the fresh vegetables, especially asparagus when in season, and always buy the venison burgers and sausages. Generally music playing in the background and if you want to get away from the crowd then just at the back there is a selection of pubs and restaurants for a quiet bite to eat and a drink||February 12, 2019
steveD4862CA||50||Lots to see and do here with good honets Pubs and Restaurants and the artisan market stalls selling food cheese and vegetables. Don't just do the market but have a look around the area as there are lots of quaint and interesting places close by.Much of it is under cover so good for a rainy day.||February 12, 2019
swissmanagement1||40||Good environment for foodies to be able to buy and also eat in different types of restaurants with good food and atmosphere.||February 12, 2019
Susan B||50||Was visiting my son in London with my aunt, so 3 generations . This place worked for all of us .great selections of fruit, veg and seafood, yum Happy stall holders and lovely to be able to try before you buy. A MUST if you're visiting London and want something different.||February 11, 2019
Caz K||50||We decided to pop into London to meet a friend and they wanted to walk around Borough Market. This is my first time I have been here and I loved it. The atmosphere is fantastic, all the different stalls where there was something for everyone albeit a little pricey. Lots of stalls letting you try their goods before you buy. I love the atmosphere and cant wait to go back.||February 11, 2019
parky93||50||I love Borough Market, plenty of food stalls, was feeling hungry so popped through for a snack and ended up getting a pulled pork burger, probably the best pulled pork burger ive had, everything looks fresh and is a great place to walk around with the family.||February 11, 2019
scottd898||40||Lovely few hours looking around, plenty to see and a huge variety of food to taste and enjoy. Quite expensive due to the tourist trap and very very busy on a Saturday afternoon but enjoyable.||February 11, 2019
351franciss||50||Stopped in Southwark for the sights and this is one place you have to visit be to browse eat drink or buy almost any food product great atmosphere great smells lovely characters always busy but just great to wander around our friends were so impressed they really loved it make an effort to visit you won't be disappointed. ||February 11, 2019
barrydavis2016||50||visited for the first time on a Saturday and i am already planning a return visit. the amount of different types of food on order are fantastic and you are definitely spoilt for choice and this is without the different types of market stalls on offer. would highly recommend||February 10, 2019
KC012||20||Not impressed, visited on a Saturday in winter and it was heaving with people, I hate to think what the summer is like.There was nowhere to sit and eat your food, so if you are happy to eat the yummy scallops with the chance of them getting bumped all over you, then go for it.There was a lot of cheese, seafood and meats, which if you are stocking for a picnic it would be great, but when staying in a hotel, the fresh foods seemed to tease me.The mulled wine was also nice.||February 10, 2019
lesleyw299||50||Having just got off the train at London Bridge station, we wandered down to Borough Market to have a look around. What an amazing place! Food of every description to try - paella’s, stews, burgers, fish, cheese, chocolate.......I could go on! Shame it wasn’t quite lunchtime, otherwise we would have got stuck in!So much to see and smell and taste. Worth a wander around event if you don’t grab anything to eat.||February 10, 2019
Nigel W||50||See what London’s Street food scene is all about. Interesting stalls from all ares giving samples and a great choice for a snack or lunch. Every thing from pizza to paella and cheese to oysters, with pies and more in between. A must do!!!||February 9, 2019
di_ontheroad||50||You can taste different food and cuisines. Before going, make sure you're hungry :) We bought paella and penne. So yummy! Everything's cheap and so delicious. Don't forget to check the closing time, not suitable for dinner. We will definitely visit this place again for lunch!||February 8, 2019
dmatesic||50||Similar to the Camden Market but much smaller. Taste some local food, have a drink and everything you like.||February 7, 2019
GuyFromTheSix||50||Borough Market is a food lovers' heaven. There were so many food stands with mouth watering smell. Duck confit sandwich, grilled scallops, raw oysters, fried squid were must tried. It was nice to see people preparing food right in front of our eyes. Too bad we only had an hour to spend there. We will definitely visit this place again next time we are in London.||February 6, 2019
athenaziavras||50||So many stands to visit with every type of cuisine you can imagine! All the vendors are so friendly despite the masses of people. Only downfall is that you probably need a few hours to properly explore all the offerings (a good problem to have in my book). Definitely worth a visit. ||February 6, 2019
honzamartinec||50||If you are in the City of London and hungry, you gotta get here and taste all the food and cuisines from all around the world. ||February 5, 2019
diptfordbluetit||50||Never been to Borough Market before - I'm thinking of excuses to come to London just to visit the market - only downside was that we'd had our breakfast and couldn't sample all the food we wanted to - MAKE SURE YOURE HUNGRY when you visit is my advice!! Brilliant place - a real jewel!!||February 5, 2019
wanderlust_rambler||40||Stay for an hour or two or grab coffee and lunch! So much to see and sample and vendors are so so friendly. We bought mackerel paste, cheese, olives, cured meats, honey, jam, bread and fruit. Sampled soft and hard cheeses, cured meats and honey! So yummy! We already had breakfast by the time we arrived but the Fish & Chips, mulled wines and ciders, and raclette or toasted cheese sandwiches looked amazing!!!Would have also loved to get some fresh veggies for the week.||February 4, 2019
Sweething69||40||Walked here from tower bridge along the river which was a really nice. I couldn’t believe how many food choices there were! Choosing what to have for lunch was so difficult ! We ended up having a Cuban cheese tostie , a German Brockhurst sausage, and Ethiopian curry ... the last one was pretty horrid . Then spent about 15 pounds on cakes. Yummmmm! I will come back here next time in London for the cakes! I definitely preferred Borough market to spitalfield market. ||February 4, 2019
DanielaD2112||50||What a great place. I had never been there before. Food stalls everywhere to suit all tastes. Was recommended by a friend so really glad I went. Would definitely recommend||February 4, 2019
bermuda1064||50||Always interesting to wander around the food market and areas around. Lots to try - don't go when hungry!Highly recommend a visit||February 4, 2019
polly1952||50||Great place for all foodies, cheese, wine, veg, fish and of course all the hot food stands from all over the world.||February 4, 2019
Kay8991||50||I had wanted to visit since my first visit to London but never got round to it but i'm so glad i did this time! I ate so much food as there is so much on offer! I had probably one of the best pasta's i have eaten at La Tua Pasta which was very reasonably priced. I then had a different type of cinnamon roll and a Madeleine from a French bakery (which i can't remember the name of!) I would happily go back on my next visit :)||February 3, 2019
ashleyyariela||40||While walking through the market, there were endless choices on food! It was so overwhelming with delicious smells. Very fun place to walk though -unless you don’t like being packed like sardines||February 3, 2019
Cristiana Menez... N||50||We went on monday and most places were closed. Anyway, we enjoyed a lot. We ate a tipical Fish and Chips and it was delicious!||February 3, 2019
PotomacJim||50||Open air markets were really the only option a few hundred years ago to find your supplies for meals. And this market goes back all that time. It’s a wonderful take and a place to grab a bite Borough market has great fresh vegetables and fruits as well as some delicious local made bread, cheese and candies. But generally, it has shifted towards more prepared foods - which makes it a good place for lunch. It is close to the Globe Theater and the Golden Hind as well as other south bank attractions. We stopped for lunch and found the best fish and chips in town. I’ll review that separately. ||February 3, 2019
deannedalisay||40||Great variety of food - from asian to traditional british. desserts to hot drinks, fresh produce (the strawberries!) and warm meals (the pies are awesome!) while there's not a lot of sitting area, this makes the crowd come in and go at a relatively quick pace, making it not too dense. would definitely go back.||February 2, 2019
WaivedWife||50||This is a great place for foodies with lots continental foods and full of interesting places to grab snacks/lunch on the go. ||February 2, 2019
tranquility92||50||I’ve been here here so many times over the years and it’s still one of my favorite places in London. I love walking around and looking at all the different stalls and what they’re selling. I also love buying things here and there to have sort of a very long (and big) lunch. My last stop is always Bread Ahead to end in a sweet note.||February 2, 2019
live2travelnottowork||50||Need food? Come here. Need to kill an hour? Wander through here. There has been a market there for over 2000 years when the Romans first came up the Thames River. It’s a wonderful market full of delicious food that you can eat on the spot or take home for later. ||February 2, 2019
mymaschere||50||Part meat market, part vegetable, part snacks and coffee and booze. What’s not to love. I could have pigged our all day & taken home supplies for tomorrow.||February 2, 2019
mphillip88||50||Food heaven!...definitely exceeded my expectations. lots of natural organic dishes with organic ingredients. lovely vendors. mostly everyone was nice, helpful and informative.||February 1, 2019
Χάρης Μ||30||Borough market is a place where you can find almost everything to eat. The prices ara high though but you should pay a visit for the experience.||January 31, 2019
Devonlily||50||I was in London for a business meeting and managed to squeeze in a morning visit to Borough Market on the recommendation of the taxi driver. Glad I did, a maze of stalls (easy to lose track of time and direction!) selling all manner of delicious fresh fruit, breads, cakes, vegetables, cheeses, spices, deli, meats, specialist dishes and ingredients. Lots of tasters available. Well worth a visit! I will certainly go back when I have more time to explore.||January 31, 2019
mellottkat||50||Every time we visit London we make a point of visiting Borough Market. This expansive outdoor market has a great selection of food from all over Europe. It is one of the oldest and largest food markets in London with evidence of a market at that site dating back to the twelfth century. The current market definitely has the feel of a Victorian/Dickensian era market, particularily at Christmas time. There are a delicious variety of grocery/charcutrie items to purchase and take home including cheeses, bread, baked goods, seafood, free range meats, cured meats, wine, beer, and anything else you could ever want to eat or drink. Expect unusual, exotic fare. There are also a ton of different street food options. You really can't go wrong. Over the course of a few days we had handmade donuts, chorizo sandwiches, fish and chips, oysters, burgers, and falafel. All of it was delicious. Definitely come early. The market gets very crowded with shoppers and tourists, and typically closes in the late afternoon. Some of the vendors accept credit cards, but the smaller stands may only take cash, and are not able to break large bills. It's advisable to bring lots of cash and small bills. It will make your shopping experience easier. The nearby area is also pretty cool. The Southwark Cathedral is worth a visit. The ruins of the Winchester Palace and a replica of the Golden Hind, an Elizabethan era ship are also nearby.Make time for this historic and elicious market on your itinerary. It's well worth a visit, and is a great place to stop for a quick inexpensive breakfast or lunch.||January 31, 2019
LondonTourman||50||A great selection of vendors with food from all over europe. Oysters, free range meats, breads and preserves. Some of the best coffee outside Italy and the cakes to accompany. Set under and around a railway station the romans had a market here nearly 2000 years ago. Enjoy, well recommended.||January 31, 2019
rebekahthor||50||One of the things that I kept hearing before I left for London was to visit Borough Market. I had only heard great reviews and was eager to check it out. In the hotel I was staying at there were even paintings of the market in our room, so I was sure this would be a staple of London. Once arriving, we learned that this market had been here for over 1,000 years! One of the first things I was able to notice was all of the fresh smelling produce and food items that were being sold. After spending a lot of time in the heart of the city of London, I was able to see a much different, less industrial side of the city.I loved being able to listen to the sellers talk about their products and being reminded the importance of buying local, rather than from a big-box store. Sometimes I get caught up in the price of something rather than thinking about the sustainability of purchasing from someone from a smaller, local business. These people were very pleasant to interact with. I ended up being able to try many different food items and cuisines. When I return to London, this is definitely a place that I will return.||January 31, 2019
McAnnie1||50||Every time we visit London we take a trip to Borough Market. Love the variety of foods to eat on offer & also the food to buy to take home. Glad we'd brought the car this visit as they had lots of lovely goods for Xmas. Was even open on Sundays in December which was great. What an amazing place. Make sure you have a rose prosecco & a delicious sausage roll!||January 28, 2019
AngelaM007||40||It seems to have grown quite a bit since we visited about ten years ago. Went on a Saturday where there was lots of street food. Could get lost around here for a few hours. Love the vibe of this place.||January 28, 2019
AniAdnan38||40||The jewel of the crown of this market is the FishKitchen shop selling Fish and Chips and the stall selling racelette...more on these in their review.Fresh products sold at this market are not exactly cheap but that's understandable since it's right smack in the City of London. The fruits are vegetables are quite expensive so I would not recommend this place for your fresh goods. The foods sold here are fortunately..fantastic...I guess because the ingredients are available fresh daily bought from the market itself. There were numerous choices to be made and each shops have a long line of faithful customers although...some stall's staffs are really NOT that friendly. Few of them do not have time to explain to foreigners about their stuffs so...just remember that you've been warned.However, the FishKitchen shop have wonderful tradisional British-style fish and chips and perhaps they'll make your journey to this market worth the while..||January 27, 2019
gmglover||40||Yes, it's wildly busy and there isn't much for a place to sit, but you'll be so busy finding new foods to eat, sampling beverages of all types and learning about cuisine from every corner of the world.||January 27, 2019
georgykun10||50||I liked it!) you can find here anything you want) from the food I mean) everything has good quality! maybe this place is nor tourists, I don't know! but still we've bought a lot! and ate to much street food))||January 27, 2019
Christopher T||20||Though we have heard many great things about the market, we were not overly impressed. We will admit most of our frustration was with how busy the market was.I would recommend coming during off times (avoid lunch time) to make the market by navigable. The queues were so long that we didn’t even bother grabbing anything to eat.Unless you are in the area, there is not anything notable to make this site a must-see.||January 27, 2019
Pam G||50||Love this place. Always my recommendation as one of the must-go places in London. You can always find something that interesting. Food, groceries, seafood, bakeries, confectionery, species and more...||January 27, 2019
ian w||40||Although a little expensive this is a great place to visit in london. Lots of choice of food and drink available. Does get very busy weekends but this just adds to the atmosphere, Also onsite toilets are free to use which is very very rare in london nowadays!!!||January 27, 2019
shell7||30||We visited after reading on another site about the gluten free stalls at the market and was really looking forward to sampling some good food. Unfortunately when we arrived (about 1pm on a Saturday) it was hideously busy and there is no system for walking in a certain direction. People just stand in the middle of the walkway and eat/talk and you have to battle against the crowds. It was very claustrophobic. We left the market and went to a nearby bar until it got quieter and returned about 4pm. Much easier to nagivate and not so many people. Anyway, managed to find one, yes only one, GF stall in the whole market. They didn't sell meals, it was a bakery with just cakes. If you don't follow a GF diet then there are plenty of places to get food. I ended up going to Brood which is just down the steps as you exit London Bridge and is the first food stall you get to. The paella was absolutely amazing!! I would travel into London just to go there again...||January 27, 2019
265rayr||50||Okay, so generally speaking, everything is a bit overpriced. You can probably go to your local supermarket and buy French Comte just as good for a fraction the price, likewise a very good bottle of red wine, for example. But that’s not really the point. It’s a great experience and if you want to avoid the usual junk (MacDonalds, overpriced Deli chain outlets etc) for a lunch on the go then this is brilliant. You will be truly spoilt for choice. In fact there’s probably too much choice. Good luck deciding! This is a great free thing to do on a day out in London. It’s also covered (by the train line bridges, giving it all the more character) whilst being open air, so weatherproof. We were there almost 2 hours just milling about and, yes, buying food we really didn’t need but just had to! Please give me a helpful vote if you found this useful. Thanks. ||January 27, 2019
3foylimaf||50||A fantastic market with a wide range of food, which hits the sweet spot of being perfect for tourists looking for food, as well as for those who genuinely are looking for produce. As a result, you get nice snacks and tasty treats but also amazing fresh food - a perfect afternoon.||January 27, 2019
AnnaK16823||50||Ate more than I needed to and bought more sweets than I needed to! So good and worth a couple hours of your time. ||January 26, 2019
Caltigerfreak||50||London is known for its markets, and this one is close to the action, on the south end of London Bridge (not the Tower Bridge that people mistakenly assume is London Bridge!).We wandered in on Saturday about 1:30 ready for lunch on our first day. We were eager to try British fish and chips, and Borough Market did not disappoint! The fish stand just inside the market area was called Fish! or something and claimed to have one various awards. They deserved awards for absolutely delicious fish and chips. Seating is limited so we stood with the other patrons and ate our meal (we split one order) standing up along the curb. £10.50 for one order - and if you want tartar sauce, be sure to order it for an extra charge!There were lots of fresh baked goods for sale in the market, along with meat, fish, produce - and specialty stalls of all sorts. It was fun to watch Londoners do their marketing right under overhead train tracks, etc. London has other great markets too, but Borough Market was on our beaten path, and we felt we got a good sampling of the London market experience. ||January 26, 2019
supercony||50||I have been here many times and just realised that I have not written a review yet. So, you might have known that there are load of various types of food. Try oysters if you love oysters, varieties of cheeses which is really nice if you love cheese, donuts outside the building are so good especially the vanilla donuts (sorry can't remember the name of this shop), coffee at a coffe shop just outside is so nice (again, can't remember the name of this coffee shop but you will see a very long queue but they are quick and worth to give it a go as you won't be disappointed, latte art is so lovely and taste good). Overall, it is a good market for food. It is crowed but it is not bad. It is worth to visit.||January 24, 2019
SueCaterham||50||Borough Market is always exciting to visit. The choice of food is incredible and the smells mouthwatering. It seems you can purchase almost any type of cooked food or ingredients you want and the range is vast. I'd encourage anyone to visit, even if just for the experience. ||January 24, 2019
noahjones84u||40||When in London,the Borough Market is a must go. The hustle and bustle gives the good vibe of the city. You can get the best food from across the world on your platter. The beef and cheese from here, shouldn’t be a miss. For those of you who doesn’t like a scrumptious meal in a crowded ambience, you can get it packed. The stall holders are so cordial and would let us try their treats before you buy them. The quality and freshness of the food is at par with the prices. All liquorice lovers are going to be spoilt with so many to choose from.The place is very accessible; it’s just a hair’s breadth from London Bridge railway.||January 23, 2019
trawell2018||50||Really great market with very good food - not only in the morning but also in the afternoon a great place to visit, buy food or eat. Tip: bring cash with you as not all sellers accept cards||January 22, 2019
barbierikab||50||We visited on Saturday and it was suuuuper crowded. There are lots of types of food that you can try. Free bathrooms. ||January 22, 2019
hollybobble7||50||Amazing little market, bustling with activity. Such a vast choice in food so there is something for everyone. We ate at the German deli, bratwurst & sauerkraut highly recommend and a very reasonable price.||January 22, 2019
Andrew C||50||The market is a foodie heaven, not just food for immediate consumption, but lots to take home as well. One minor issue, there is virtually nowhere to sit and eat food you have purchased, of course space is limited, but ditching the elegant but next to useless seating in the covered area for something more practical would increase the seat count 4 fold.||January 21, 2019
Hjekman||50||Have a glass of wine at Bedales, try scallops at Shell Seekers, just look at all fantastic supply. Fresh, nicely shown, often artisanal. I just love the ambience. ||January 20, 2019
jonathansF724XW||50||A definite visit if and when you are in London. Visit with the intent to have lunch from one of the various and amazing stalls. Hence keep light at breakfast as you want to be hungry to try more then one stall. The market is covered so even if it rains you are sheltered.... enjoy!||January 20, 2019
Turtle5954||50||Great market, full of life and multitudes of food options - eat there or buy for home. Dishes from all over the world. Just a lovely market to experience.||January 20, 2019
Patrick G||40||We visited this unique market place around 1 pm on Saturday and the place was packed.Practically no room to move, no space to halt and chat with the vendors .....You absolutely need to avoid noon during the weekends.||January 20, 2019
ttab1||50||Superb market can be a bit overpriced but amazing displays friendly sellers excellent for foodies tea shop on corner superb for buying something slightly different good for present shopping if you want something g out of the ordinary when you finished find mice telacing cafe or wine bar .||January 19, 2019
David C||40||Had a recommendation to visit so did Friday but it is atmospheric but very busy and at times very crowded in the narrow alleys and walk ways. Loads of various artisan produce especially meats and cheeses and other produce from all over the world. The vendors are friendly and you can get some samples at a few of the places.Locals and tourists visit and has a nice vibe to it||January 18, 2019
Trvlchic5||40||Great spot to shop from locally sourced goods and products. Did find the market hard to navigate but did not disappoint with its offerings. It was nice to see that a number of the vendors allowed you to sample their products before buying and we found that we were pretty full after the samples. Definitely worth spending some time here.||January 18, 2019
merlin03||50||This is a super place to visit, authentic food from around the world with so much choice and variety The salt beef sandwiches are addictive and set you up for the day.Just a 10 minute walk from the monument which is well worth it.A must visit place ||January 18, 2019
Mishell123||40||Happy lunch for 7.5 euro! Not bad quality and great amount hash brown and fried egg and bacon sausage burger.It is also free for add tomato, fried onion and salad!The only one disadvantage is a lttile uncomfortable to eat because of great amount and only available to go!||January 17, 2019
sofieg151||50||If you, like me, like food and love to taste and to cook this is well worth a visit. We went in the morning and if I could go again i would choose to arrive a bit later to be able to enjoy a lunch or dinner. Artisan breads, cheeses, spices and much more and I was in heaven! Just whished i could have brought more home to Sweden that day! Bought spices, but the cheeses seemed a bit too tricky to store on the flight home. The family greatly enjoyed it too!||January 17, 2019
Phil R||50||Lots to do in and around the market - great produces of all varieties to take home with you, and lots of pubs and restaurants to stop off at also||January 17, 2019
AmyS419||50||This market is one of the oldest food markets in London and reeks with charm and hidden tasty treasures. Whether it's a sweet treat, cheese, nuts, or a myriad of other delicacies, Borough Market is worth the trip!||January 15, 2019
englishtravller||50||Great place to visit. We tasted Cheese, Ham, wine and Beer. The prices are a little bit high but still a great experience.If you're in the area go visit.||January 15, 2019
julesten2016||50||The Borough market is the pinnacle of farmers markets and dates back to the 12th century. Although the current building was built in the 1850's.The market sells fresh produce from all around Britain and the world all under one roof.This is a collection of different and amazing foods & colourfully displayed for ones pickings. This list of cuisine reads like a travel log of exotic places.We spent a couple of hours prosecco in hand wondering the stalls and sampling wears.The market is a busy bustling place were one does need to take time. Go hungry leave fullA foodies must not to be missed.||January 15, 2019
H E||50||I work near by so I walk through here regularly, occasionally I stop and buy things. There's lots here if you enjoy a market, mostly food though. If you love fresh fruit and veg, cheese and tea this is definitely the place for you. It is a little pricey at some stalls but I've never been dissapointed by anything I've bought. The market also has some great street food stalls selling anything from cake to Keebabs, curry and burgers. There's also some smaller, independent coffee shops, pubs and a hairdressers/ barbers located there and some pricier restaurants such as Roast and Black and Blue. It's popular so it's very busy but if your near by it's totally worth a visit.||January 15, 2019
Amanda H||50||LOVED this market. Had Thai, paella, amazing cheese, tasty teas, gyros, sausages, the world's best jamon, and more. The produce was spectacular. It was a bit crowded but may have been due to the holiday season.||January 15, 2019
ian s||50||Myself and a client ate here 13th December, we had an early table, so weren't rushed. The menu was heaven for a seafood lover like myself. The fusion of flavours was just gorgeous. Service was A1 and it was really good value. Recommend to anybody, great atmosphere too||January 15, 2019
Emily W||50||Personally, as a caterer and shopping addict, it doesn't get better than this! My absolute mecca in London and never disappoints. Fantastic produce, great atmosphere and delicious food to munch on whilst you browse - perfection.||January 15, 2019

Ilse_IZU||50||Borough Market is a must visit place if you're in London. There are so many foods to enjoy- cuisines from all over the world, all kinds of drinks to taste. Hundreds of choices- everything your heart desires will be there. Don't you dare skipping this place!||January 13, 2019

mikerH1983DH||50||This market has been around for almost 1000 years. It is mostly food stalls where you can buy things to take back to wherever you happen to be staying - or you can eat right there. The variety is impressive and interesting and the prices are not outrageous. We visited a number of times while we were in London. We quite liked it.||January 11, 2019
Shirley5654||50||My friend and I came across this restaurant by accident. We wanted to eat elsewhere, but they rebuked us,which was most unpleasant. So, we walked into Black & Blue and were welcomed by a happy smiling waitress. The food and wine was delicious and the ambience was great. Will definitely eat here again.||January 9, 2019
Mildred F||50||enjoyed the busy ambience, particularly the food stalls and craft stalls. Great place to be for X'mas & the New Year.||January 9, 2019

Island-of-Thassos||20||It may have been a wonderful place to visit and taste various cuisines in yesteryear but what I saw was unhygenic, overpriced mediocre cooking at best.||January 9, 2019
globetrotter505||50||This market is very authentic and very busy. There is a good variety of food and drinks. Hold on to your bags to avoid getting victimised by dishonest visitors.||January 9, 2019
DesmondSF||50||The only negative remarks I could make about this place is that too many other people know about it (not legitimate complaint), and there's virtually no where to sit and eat all the amazing food options (legitimate complaint). Otherwise, it's an AWESOME place, with so many amazing food options. Not only all the various ethnicities of prepared foods, but also the vast array of desserts, cheeses, breads, fruits and charcuterie....all set in a funky and cool environment. If it wasn't so fricken cold when we were there, I would have loved to gather up picnic type food stuffs and head to the Thames. Alas, we were just forced to stand and eat our amazing Indian, Thai, Indonesian and Brit foods under the market roof. Will definitely return here every time I'm in London.||January 8, 2019
PiyasiMi||50||Crazy variety of beef, pork, sea food, cheese and bakery items. MUST VISIT for every foodie visiting LOndon for the first time.P.S.: Borough Market also featured in Jab tak hain jaan's challa scene with Shahrukh Khan in it!||January 8, 2019
jhhorton||50||We came here on the first day of our three day trip to London and we were so overwhelmed by how amazing this place is.We departed the tube at London Bridge from Canary Wharf and decided to walk into London from there to make sure we didn't miss a thing. This resulted in us walking through Borough Market, a place I wanted to visit eagerly and ironically we sort of stumbled upon it.Scruffy bacon sandwiches and then clams from another stall round the corner greeted us.A truly unique and remarkable market full of ever type of food or beverage you could think of.We are staying in London in March and have ensured we stay near by to get our food fix the following morning.||January 7, 2019
kellyw782018||50||I love borough market it is a delight to wander round the brightly coloured stalls and smell food from all corners of the globe.On this trip I brought my 11 year old son and he was amazed we bought a bag full of different fruit that neither of us had seen before, so that we could try them when we got back to the hotel!!There is definitely something for everyone at borough market pulled pork to vegan juices to special blend teas.If you are in the area I would say definitely go and have a look! And it’s free to look ||January 7, 2019
686chrise||50||It has even more stalls now and more streetfood available- Yorkshire well represented by the Ginger Pig and even has it's own cookery school - the profusion of different tastes as you walk around is in another wprld||January 7, 2019
Jenny M||50||My family and I travel an hour just to come here as often as we can. The special food here is top notch and well worth the travel! (Everything weve tried weve liked... and weve pretty much tried everything over the years)Be advised it can get really crowded during meal times!||January 7, 2019
nickandangels||40||Borough Market, one of the oldest markets in London, is a fabulous cornucopia of hustle, bustle, colour and countless food delicacies from both British and the wider world. Definitely worth a visit to eat or just to browse and soak up the unique atmosphere ||January 6, 2019
Overseasfun145||50||A morning stroll around Borough Markets is a must for all visitors to London. This was our second time,made even more special just before Christmas. The decorations and seasonal food and drink,plus shopping for last minute gifts was exciting.||January 6, 2019

TroyA184||40||This is really a proper market for locals to buy their food. There is a great variety of cheeses, meats etc but it is not a market that caters for people who actually want to eat there - there are breads and coffees for sale, but nowhere to sit down. It is over the road from the Tube.||January 6, 2019
MichelV1847||50||Food stalls with amazing stuff from all over the world. Nice shops. Perfect atmosphere. Not open on sunday !!!||January 6, 2019

AlanDCFC||50||Been here several times and always stay in the Southwark area when on a trip to London Borough market is a busy, bustling place that specialises in a wide variety of food and drink stallsYou can get all sorts of delicious authentic foods here and part of the charm is just wandering around before making your choiceSet right next to Southwark cathedral and in the old arches the whole place has a sense of charm about it and there are many local stalls and eateries situated both in and on the periphery of the marketGreat atmosphere and one of the best parts of LondonAnd you can visit Bridget Jones’s front door if you must, as many people seem to A must visit area if you are in the capital ||January 4, 2019
897wendyf||50||We loved the Borough Market! Incredible variety of delicious food. We visited twice on our last trip to London and sampled Thai, Spanish, German, Italian, French and English dishes and baked goods. The atmosphere is great for browsing and people watching. Be prepared for large crowds and limited places to actually sit to eat the food. We will make this a regular stop every time we go to London. ||January 4, 2019
cuddslfc||50||Some would say the best food market in london something for everyones taste and to try, my top 4 to try in Borough Market .#1-Monmouth coffee a kick and a half of caffeine, if you like your coffee this place is a must .#2-Kappacasein Dairy : 4 cheese toasty, this is iconic at the end of the day is a 4 cheese toasty which is a bit pricey for what it is “£7”#3-Gourmet goat - either a wrap or in a box with healthy salad - this was my favourite #4-Brindisa grill - chorizo sandwich , spicy chorizo with rocket and peppers.This was our best 4 ENJOY||January 4, 2019

MrsBeex||50||Travelled to London today for my Dads Birthday, we decided to take a walk to Borough Market. What a wonderful place! Brightly coloured fruit and veg and the most amazing fresh cooked hot food at every angle you look! Friendly traders, well laid out. Will definitely return. ||January 3, 2019
lilysingsonbellotti||50||I absolutely absolutely love this place, fresh meat, produce, and surrounded by wonderful place to eat with equally good quality food. The place is not very big but the choices spoils you. If anyone loves cooking this is the place to be.||January 3, 2019
gcinnamon||50||The Borough Market should not be missed if you're on holiday in London (or even if you live here), you can find any type of cuisine and food and even buy groceries (fresh vegetables, fruits, etc.), of course I haven't tried everything as that is kind of impossible but I was always happy whenever I've purchased anything, sweet and savoury.It has only two downfalls: it's closed on Sundays, and most times it's really really crowded, to the point where it gets frustrating trying to walk through it. Still, I love it! ||January 3, 2019
Carmine M||10||Avoid Ted's Veg at Borough Market. Asda supermarket produce passed its best sold at premium prices to honest londeners. Just walk around to the car park to see Kath Ted and the boys debagging huge amounts of Asda fruit and veg.||January 3, 2019
emelian||50||Amazing range of goods, meats cheeses etc etc. huge range of food stalls so massive choice for breakfast and lunch. Got to be 10 cheese shops alone. You can try almost everything before you buy. Great visit next to shard. Get off London bridge tube.||January 3, 2019
geoffg153||50||My partner is from Canada and always wanted to visit the market and I have to say it was brilliant, vibrant, busy with a combination of people shopping and sight seeing Walk around and try the nibbles on offer, have the oysters & prosecco It’s a super place to spend a Saturday morning and just people watch ||January 3, 2019
_davidawinter||50||Borough Market is an absolute delight. We toured around the market and nearby shops 4 times taking in the atmosphere and sampling the delights taking with us game and pork pies, smoked eel, gravlax, smoked trout and salmon and copious amounts of British cheeses all of which were transported overseas so that our friend to enjoy some real British production.Stall holders are exceptionally knowledgeable in their products always willing for you to try before you buy. Prices were agreeable when considering the quality and freshness. A great place to visit, take your time and breath in the traditional fare. Make sure to wander into some of the side streets and do not forget to visit Neil’s Yard Dairy for some of the finest British cheeses.Borough Market was my, and my wife’s food heaven. ||January 3, 2019

sleeplessMOm2013||50||Our time in London felt so short. We had to make some hard choices and we chose right by going to the Borough market for 2 hours. So worth the trip. Delicious couple of hours that will be in our memories. Baked good, cured meats, good coffee, savory pies.... come hungry!||December 31, 2018
898frank||40||At Borough market you can find almost all the food you want, amazing selection. Take your time to wander around and then make a choice. During our visit (lunch time) in the festive season it was rather overcrowded, normally it is still lively but not that busy.||December 31, 2018
perpetual_wanderer77||50||Foods from all around the world in one place. A foodies delight. We had cheeses from all around England, tried wines and meats. Ate pain au chocolates and fresh dosas. A fantastic place if you love food and are adventurous and like to try new things. We purchased some apple chutney from Neals Yard. It is fantastic.||December 30, 2018
choonphangt||50||Come during Christmas time and it is really really a lots of visitor. Full of food stall and my advice is if you think you want to eat, don’t wait as it might be the long q after you come back. Just buy or rag when u feel it.||December 30, 2018
schonenacht||50||This is easily one of the best markets to wander through or grab some lunch. There is a wonderful array of sights, smells, and flavours to suit all tastes. I like pick up something to eat then head down by the river to enjoy it. If you can't find something you like here, you may not find it anywhere.||December 30, 2018
billay2001||50||A real treat. We walked from St. Paul’s chapel, across the Millennium Bridge. It’s a cool to stumble onto it as the smells, noise and people start giving it away. There are so many great cheese stands that all give samples. There is also produce and cooked food stands. Just a great place to go and hang out and sample some cool food. Plan on buying some food from the purveyors and taking it back with you. Worth the visit!||December 30, 2018
DanielaDavide7577||50||It was a nice surprise to visit the market during a weekend in London. Just too crowded but that’s normal in the end of the year festive time. A lot of freshly cooked food from all countries. You’ll certainly find something of your taste! The closest tube station was London Bridge and from there is easy to have a walk along the river Thames ||December 30, 2018
GarryOwenBrain||50||If you are hungry, go to this market. There is a wide variety of food venders selling everything from German sausages to seafood and tacos - it is all excellent. I can’t imagine you will not find something for everyone in your party at the market. The prices are reasonable as well; it is cheaper than most restaurants, and tastes much better!||December 30, 2018
Dale W||50||I visited here three days before Christmas and it was jam-packed with people. One could barely walk between the stalls as people were buying, tasting, and perusing the various victuals. The sights, sounds, and smells all made for a wonderful sensory experience.||December 29, 2018
enurweb||50||Amazing and fascinating experience. To see, observe and to parcipate... Just magical.Bought quite a few gifts to bring home.||December 29, 2018

Maricdaher||50||Borough Market is a must go place in London, specially if you enjoy good food. Normally it is crowd. There you can find all types of street food and great ingredients from local producers. I love it!||December 28, 2018
FrmS6||10||I bought 6 urchins from a stand called the "Furness Fish Markets" just before Christmas and all of them were spoiled as the smell was not good at all. I went back to the stand and bring them the urchins that i didn't consume because of the smell and the staff and especially the manager didn't want t believe me and only refund me half of the price of the purchase and told me loud in front every body " never shop here again"! Is it a way to deal with complain? he through away the cash . I am sorry I WILL certainly never shop any seafood at the "Furness Fish Market" but I will for also spread the word to my friends and entourage to avoid this stand at the Borough Market . I feel like very intimided and low in front of this rude manager with tatoos and staff.||December 28, 2018
tiv507||50||I hit Borough Market every time I have a day or longer layover in London. There are other markets that are newer, hipper, up-and-coming, etc... but BM is the oldest in London and still my favorite. Get there however you want - I use it as a walking destination. I generally stay near Paddington and Hyde Park so I can do a park walk through the city (Hyde-St James), head over one of the bridges, and continue along the Embankment until I arrive at BM ready to eat. It's a perfect way of blowing the long-distance flight cobwebs and stretching my legs before the next flight (roughly a 5-6 mile walk one way with plenty to see). Why this market? It's a wonderful, eclectic fusion of sights, sounds, smells, and tastes. There are dozens of vendors to appeal to any appetite - seafood, farm-to-market meats, fresh produce, bread and pastries, cheeses, chocolates and sweets, coffee, tea, etc... If you go over the Christmas holidays, the mulled wine is a tasty treat, either in the market or at any of the stalls along the embankment (I've also seen mulled whiskey on offer). Just wandering around the market can fill you up because everyone's always offering you a sample of their product. Unless you're a big eater, I'd suggest sharing what you buy because many of the portions are generous. Monmouth Coffee is off to one side of the market, as is Neal's Yard Dairy - a must for any cheese connoisseurs or anyone who just wants to see what a real cheese shop looks like. There's also a decent vintner and some specialty shops if you're looking for gifts. Keep in mind that Heathrow has enhanced security for carry-on so plan on placing bottles that won't fit in the little plastic bag they give you at the airport in your checked bags (you can, however, carry on cheeses as long as they're well-wrapped). Some of the vendors close a little early and the market shuts at 5 pm sharp so if you want all the market has to offer, I'd get there before 3 pm. It's always closed on Sundays, except the Sundays leading up to Christmas and New Year's they have special open hours - check online for that. It also makes a nice addition to a Tower of London tour. I've had baps, burgers, shucked oysters, batter-fried fish and chips, paellas, wild mushroom risottos, focaccia,falafel, coffee, tea, danish, gingerbread,...as I said, something for every appetite and I've never been disappointed in my choice.||December 27, 2018
bernardlimsh||50||This is one of those very quaint and charming places you have to visit to appreciate the local culture and food. There is a wide range of local street food and cheeses to tempt the palate. And the wines are also a good mix of local and international, offering a variety of choice to all. I especially liked the handmade chocs and other local delicacies.||December 24, 2018
Lorenzocarlucci92||50||I have been there 3 times and i am sure i will come back.Basicly when i am off and i want to go to have proper street food i go there.You can find a large choise of different food..italian, french, german, british, mexican and so on..and it's almost everything delicious.Last time i went there next to the "fish market" it was a new stand that was cooking just risotto with mushrooms cooked with butter in a big pam and it was really good.If you love food, in particular street food.. going in borough market it 's like to go in paradise.Enjoy|||December 23, 2018
U202ACdaveb||50||ten feet into yhe market an the smells of spice brought big smiles to Mme and my wife. Only in a cultural diverse city like London could you get the waif of curries and representative spices from every continent. We stopped to get the award winning Fish and chips.Our only compliant was the inadequate seating to try the vendor's offerings.Further in, We viewed the diverse meat sold by he butchers representing game available to buy...if only we had a kitcw=en to use.The cheese shoe in the rear allowed us to try the cheddars or blues. We checked some with luggage and it held up fine. We likened this to Toronto's Kensington market, a variety of agriculture and seasoning all unfder one roof. We took the desert,frshly made doughnuts, back to the Shangrila, for a snack later.M wife heard,"What do you mean?you only bought one!"?several times....Borough Market is an adult amusement park- a culinary wonderland, not to be missed.Thi is not the trinket place. Ma have to hit a different market for London souvenirs...||December 23, 2018
jelias71||50||Even off season Saturday at the market is a zoo. Be patient and try to see all the stalls. What a great selection - awesome experience in London ||December 22, 2018
forthright48||50||Lots of shops selling mostly fruits, liquor, baking goods, sea foods and street foods. Really interesting to go through the shops one by one. Some shops even sell freashly cooked foods and they taste really good. Though, considering they are being sold almost on a street, the price felt a bit high.||December 22, 2018
FormerCaliBoy||50||I ended up at the Borough Market several days during my stay in London simply due to it being nearby my hotel, the number of reasonably priced selections of food stands and of course the fresh and mostly locally supported products. There were seafood stands, fresh greens & herbs, veggies, meats, cheese, sweets and pastries that I just had to sample a few, plants, and so much more that I could mention. During my visits, one day I sampled a sandwich, another day an awesome chicken wrap and on another visit chose several different sweets from the various vendors. All products were fresh and tasty and the vendors were so willing to help and explain some of the contents of their food. One can’t go wrong with visiting here for such a variety of interesting foods to eat and/or take home with you. Do yourself a favor and make sure to make a stop at the Borough Market for a real treat. Highly recommended.||December 22, 2018
MattW929||50||So many different foods to choose from. Ethiopian, Japanese, German, Indian, gourmet burgers, pie and mash, vegan hot dogs! It’s street food so expect to stand around and eat as limited seats. ||December 21, 2018
kevh938||50||So you are looking at your travel book or online and you see two main markets Borough and Camden They are completely different. The Borough is all food and some crafts. Great place to go and have a little something from each place. The hardest decision is where to start. I had the meat pie-delicious. My wife had a gluten free burger. We also snacked on cheese. There were vendors that we tried jams, sausage, fudge, bread...Do not miss this stop!||December 20, 2018
umutdenizakar||50||Being at an ancient market is fascinating! I resisted buying all the goods I had seen. I storngly recommend to buy british cheese.||December 20, 2018
pr1754||40||Talk about a wide selection to choose from - the hardest part of the trip was choosing what to eat. Award-winning cheeses, charcuterie, breads, coffees, artisanal food, regional specialties, pastries, game, local fare.... we finally went with a fusion type of rice bowl, a Bengali-African combination of beef, rice and veggies. Very good. The only downside is that you eat standing up or walking around.||December 20, 2018
kgv2828||50||Every time we are in London, I make sure I go to Borough's market. It is a bit touristy and can be a little expensive but it is still fun. You get to try so many different types of food from Asian to Indian to English food. We have had German sausage on a bun, Mac and Cheese, Fish and Chips, good beer and generally a good time. It is ideal to make this part of an excursion like visiting the Tate museum and then walking over to eat something fun. Definitely recommend visiting Borough's market and trying out the food. But there are many tourist abound but still quite enjoyable.||December 18, 2018
StephenCr0ss||50||Walk over London Bridge and you will find the market. Its full of all sorts of activities and shops ....from Cheese to bread to bars and places to eat. Really is something for everyone and its a great atmosphere.||December 18, 2018
781ashleyn||40||The title had nothing to do with Borough Market. I just picked one of the busiest weekends of the year to visit. For me though it has far too many food stalls. A bit more variety of other things to sell/buy please!||December 18, 2018
silviab0rges||40||Great way to spend a few hours wandering and nibbling . Go hear to browse (and eat your way through) the city’s oldest produce and artisanal food market, at the foot of London Bridge. The vibe is friendly and fairly slow-paced, if overwhelmingly crowded at times.||December 18, 2018
JanetC2029||50||Right next to the Shard we found this following a recommendation from a friend – and what a find! Dating back centuries, this really is food heaven with produce to tempt everyone. A real gem, this will definitely be on my ‘must visit’ place in the future||December 17, 2018

ellenhibbs||50||Love visiting Borough Market just to wonder round all of the different food stalls.There is an abundance of great places to eat at, you’re spoilt for choice and can also get your hands on some great produce to take away including cheese, bread etc. You can also grab a great coffee from Monmouth round the corner and The Shard is within walking distance too so could always pop to Borough Market for some lunch pre/post your trip there.Definitely worth a visit if you love your food. ||December 15, 2018
179CharlieBravo||10||Have been using Roast for many years now for our Christmas visit to the market below, never again. Table for three booked for a champagne breakfast (bearing in mind it was the coldest day of the year so far) we were placed in a clearly unheated area of the restaurant it was freezing cold, we ordered a bottle of champagne and our £14.50 p/p breakfasts. The champagne arrived promptly as did the breakfasts - too soon in fact, the breakfasts were all tepid even in the Baltic conditions that we were placed in not one part of the breakfasts had any steam rising from it, clearly preprepared and not kept appropriately heated. If you think I’m exaggerating our waitress was wearing a shawl to deliver our food. I asked the waiter who took our initial order why it was so cold, he said it was because of the windows and that he was cold too. As I have stated we have been going for years at this time and wherever we have been sat it has been perfectly fine heat warmth wise. £134 to freeze. You will never see a penny of our hard earned cash again, as you can’t be bothered to follow a basic right for even your frozen staff - one serving in a shawl (hygene), other claiming he was cold too and I saw another serving food in a black Adidas top how unprofessional. 15/12/18 08;40am.||December 15, 2018

Georgy R||50||My partner and I spent the weekend in the Southwark/South Bank area and so decided to visit Borough Market as part of a leisurely and convivial Saturday morning. I'm so glad we did! The Market is absolutely jam packed with just about every food you can think of, with a lively and welcoming atmosphere. There's plenty of places to sit and gorge yourself silly, and loads of things to tempt you. I had a wonderful vegan pistachio and pomegranate cake from a lovely seller in the middle of the market and my partner had a fabulous glittery salted caramel cupcake fromnthe same seller. I would highly recommend grabbing a coffee and a cake, finding a place to perch, and doing a bit of people watching as you soak it all in. Lovely place!||December 15, 2018
GavinP851||40||Borough market really is a gastronomic treat for every taste. The sights, sounds and aromas in and around the market are an experience on themselves, great food to tempt yourself with and produce to die for. If you love food this is a place that you really should go to even just to experience tastes from around the world and exotic flavors. ||December 14, 2018
arnoldzimuto||40||i recently went to borough market as i was going to visit a friend in Southwark. I forgot that this is the expensive end of markets. its as markets go ok familiar and as expected the only difference is that it is the high-end price wise compared to all other markets in so. You will find all the usual things food wise etc you expect to find but you are just paying more for it because of the location of the market that's all really. No other surprises or expectancies.||December 12, 2018
D7127GJkristinak||50||We visited the market on a Saturday morning. It was ful of people and there were plenty of stalls with amazing food and drinks. This really is a treat for all food lovers. So much freshly prepared food from all over the world in one place. I tried ice cream from goats milk, columbian coffee and some great English sweet pies. I am only sorry that I visited this market on Saturday as there were so many people, my husband went there on a week day and said there were almost no crowds at all.||December 12, 2018
theV0ice||40||Went there last Saturday. Should have gone early in the morning. It was hype and happening. Be extra careful and cautious with your precious belongings. Say cheeseee.. there's a lot of cheese everywhere, fresh fruits, bread etc. Loved it!||December 12, 2018
Liz A||50||What a fantastic market, especially at Christmas time. Carol singers, decco’s galore and what a great atmosphere. Such a variety of stalls selling there wares, the street food is amazing, a must place to see in London and of course not forgetting the scenes from Notting Hill. The restaurants around the market and bars with a great atmosphere. One definitely not to be missed.||December 11, 2018
Sam M||50||Having lived in or around London all my life I have never visited Borough Market.I absolutely loved it, the only downside was because of the time of year it was heaving!The vibe is amazing and people are very smiley and sociable.The food and drink that is available at every turn is wonderful.There are pubs all around the edge of the market and if you just walk out of the centre of the market there are streets with pubs restaurants and shops.Borough Market is truly an Old English Gem!||December 11, 2018
ahdus8||50||Although i went ona monday - where not all shops were open - the place was still bustling with sellers and people wanting to buy the wares and food on sale....had a pleasant experience trying the cheese samples....risotto....fudge...aah....the list goes on....fantastic place to explore||December 11, 2018
Shizuka56||50||Great place for a leisurely stroll, lots of food options, reasonable prices and easy transport makes this a good place for visitors to London.||December 11, 2018
iKnowFood101||50||I love this place. A few things to keep in mind:1) Most all shops are cash only. Go to an ATM and get some pounds beforehand.2) It is mostly all food related, either great eat in the moment options or fun artisan pantry items.3) There are no places to sit anywhere in the market, this is a grab and go place. So either comfy shoes or a stop off to another destination.4) London in general is a low to no bag shopping zone, so bring your own tote or prepare to pay a few pence more for bags.5) The lines are longer between noon-2pm due to a lunch rush. Don't get stuck "outside" the market. Venture in and you'll find more shops and food and drink.||December 11, 2018
Stewart C||40||We visited the Borough Market whilst on a trip to London to see the Christmas markets and walking from the South Bank centre to London Bridge.The Borough Market is a great place to buy all types of food both cooked for ‘takeaway’ or ingredients for a self-prepared meal and arriving shortly after 12 on a weekday afternoon we found it to be very busy with people using the various takeaway outlets in their dinner breaks. It is located close to Southwark Cathedral and directly underneath two tall railway bridges which gives it quite an interesting atmosphere.We took a wander around the various market stalls and noticed some interesting cheese shops and wine outlets and also some chutney and jam stalls all with the vendors keen to offer samples of their wares.If you have time look up at the metal and glass canopy constructed like a giant Meccano kit forming part the roof of the market and also the metal spans of the railway bridges sitting on sturdy brick arches, there is an almost uninterrupted sound of trains passing overhead though this is not obtrusive.Certainly worth a visit if you are in the area and are looking for either familiar or not so familiar foods or dishes to try, or even just curious.||December 11, 2018
Daylebag||40||Borough has lots of food choices it’s hard to decide. We walked around for a solid hour looking at all the fun stands. I ended up getting a steak and ale pie at pieminister and it was great!||December 10, 2018
andrewt3233||50||When visiting London, make sure you make time to visit Borough Market! Great speciality food stalls, great selection of street food on offer, and fab location under the bridge and close to The Shard!||December 10, 2018
Alan S||40||The talent that lies behind the stall owners is immense. That produces fantastic food for every possible taste. Really enjoyed paella of the highest quality and cheeses from France. Highly recommend ||December 10, 2018
MJcatlvr||50||Borough Market is not to be missed. From raw and cooked meats, fish, cheeses, pastries, nuts, wine and gift items. Covered market so don't stay away if raining. Stop for a glass or two of wine atop a candle lit barrel then head to Fish! for some unbelievable takeaway Fish n Chips. We will return.||December 10, 2018
ksim11||50||Visited at the weekend and with the run up to Christmas, it was absolutely heaving. Great atmosphere though and all of the food looked amazing. Grab a doughnut from Bread Ahead - to die for! My boyfriend also had the pasta which looked amazing.||December 10, 2018
Allan C||10||Had a brilliant weekend break with my wife and daughter for my birthday ,Borough market was a dream for me. Went to the wheatsheaf and i cant believe how much it dissapointed The staff are unresponsive to the extent of being rude. I ordered 2 pints of Peronni which unbelievebly came in old bitter glasses so it was dreadful (someone should advise them that if Peronni observe this the license to sell will be revoked) . Unfortunately worse is to come.. My wife was needing to freshen up before we left. She described to me that as she ascended the stairs the smell became stronger and more acrid. The toilets were a disgrace. No seats. No handles to flush. My wife and three other ladies walked away. Staff just shrugged when hearing about our concerns!! Obviously hapoy that regulars are accepting this disgraceful situation I wonder if the regulars who had to wait 20 min for the hot gin would be happy ? Instead of a hot clear fragrance filled delight . It was only juat warm cloudy reheated sluddge. And even then as they were passing this offensive rubbish.. they only wanted to take his his mobey.. This place is a disgrace and the licensing authority needs needs to review itself and its inspectors.||December 9, 2018
BenGenn||40||An interesting selection of food and produce of which we indulged in a few, it didn’t quite live up to the hype for us personally but it was still a good place to spend a few hours.||December 9, 2018
777SarahB777||50||We were due to meet for coffee but the trains were delayed so I had half an hour on my hands. What a delight to get lost in this magic place from times gone by. So many different tastes and smells to take in, paradise, so much to enjoy. ||December 9, 2018
Erikco77||50||A stone throw away from the London Underground, this hidden gem is packed with people. Very busy and the atmosphere is what you would expect from a very traditional old fashioned market.Lots of stalls with different food drinks on sale. Food here is cheap, and you will be spoilt with choices. Cheese and chorizos are my favourite and I always buy them whenever I get rhe chance to see this amazing place. ||December 9, 2018
nicoleandcurtis||40||Lots of great international options at this fun market! We enjoyed walking around and eating lots of different cuisines, but we definitely didn’t allow enough time to walk through the whole thing, and it was a little confusing to find, but overall well worth the visit!||December 8, 2018
Lyonsaj||50||I went there on a Saturday morning at 10AM. At that time everything was opened and there weren't too many people there. It was a fun environment and sampling different options from different vendors was a great way to spend an afternoon. Would highly recommend this to a visitor who wants to get the most out of London but doesn't have a lot of time in the city.||December 5, 2018
LouCole||50||Such a vivid market. Your senses go into overdrive with the variety of sights, smells and tastes. Just a wonderful place to visit and to eat, drink and watch the world go by.||December 5, 2018
VentureGill||50||Lovely market with different hand made items. Great place for Christmas shopping if you're looking for some original gifts. Some things are a bit pricey but worth a price if it's handmade||December 4, 2018
Kevin D||40||I have visited BM many times. Very handily placed 100m from London Bridge station. There is a myriad of burgers, vegan, seafood, hot food outlets. There are also dozens of cheese shops , deli's , bars ...easily spend a good 2-3 hours here, or more. Worth setting aside a least half a day to mingle. Ideally get there 10am to 11am, as around lunchtime the place gets very, very busy. A fun place to be.||December 3, 2018
Iyari123||50||Guys this is the place to be, we arrived in the morning and were excited to see this vivid market with fresh and tasty food. You can find a meal from every part of the world. We bought several dishes, mulled wine, cheese, fruits... It was a perfect! We have enjoyed this market a lot! Highly recommended||December 2, 2018
Afred_Ong||30||Visited as part of a tour, lots of cheese, berries and oysters around. The vendors are nice and polite, even offer free taste that they pick/cut directly from what they are selling. Downside, most of the stuff are overpriced, and am not fond of snacking. Visit if you are around London Bridge otherwise can skip this detour.||December 2, 2018
Mick W||40||If you’ve never been, and a foodie you’re missing out!Great selection of food and drink opportunities, for both purchase or consumption on the spot.Get off at London Bridge rather than Borough and save your legs.||December 1, 2018
740katjas||40||This market is very nice. Lots of small places to by food to eat or to bring home. Around the market are a lot of small cosy restaurants. Lots of people when we visited. ||December 1, 2018
ryinoc||50||Daily market at the base of London Bridge with a wide variety of raw and prepared food vendors. Great place to explore and have lunch. The vanilla creme donut from Bread Ahead was very good, as was the pasta from La Tua Pasta.||November 27, 2018
travelsominx||40||Borough Market has developed massively over the last few years to cater for the crowds of visitors it attracts every day. It has a substantial array of food from purveyors of produce, butcheries, seafood, cheeses, wines, bread, oils, chocolate, doughnuts, plus a ton of hot food stalls offering a very impressive selection of delicious takeaways.It's a great place to visit to try and buy some truly high quality fare. I recently brought a group of international friends and they had a marvellous time eating and drinking their way 'around the world' there.It's also a good place to buy organic meat and produce, but be prepared to pay top dollar.Also, be warned it does become extremely crowded at times especially as it is geared very much towards tourists.||November 27, 2018
AbhishekS4354||40||this was my 3rd visit .. however this time it was a cold november day ..some of pubs on the park street have made arrangements for heating .. but the cold did not deter tourists i found still as many people..well this place deserves to be in everyon’ must to do bucket list||November 26, 2018
hem0116||50||Lots of Continental and English Shire producers of good that is difficult to find outside of specialty food markets Lots of French cheeses, Spanish hams and English cheese too||November 26, 2018
cant0003||50||Had found this market recommended on tripadvisor and visited after a viewing from the Shard. This is located just 5 minutes from the Shard and on the day of our visit was just getting dusk and all the stalls were illuminated. There must have been food from most parts of the world all very well presented and very tempting. We would have like to buy some of the cheese from the drunk goat but had no where to store it in our hotel room. Also many stalls selling gifts. Well worth a visit but make sure you are hungry to appreciate the wonderful street food||November 26, 2018
RoyR225||50||Our friend is a cook and ingredient expert and had never been to this iconic market. We arrived around 10:30 on Saturday morning and it wasn’t too busy, although our son visited in the afternoon when it was so crowded he couldn’t move.Our foodie friend didn’t know where to look next, so much was on display. Her taste buds were caressed with flavours from the many samples offered - until she tried a nuclear chilli sauce, which was more of an assault!Great atmosphere even if you are not a food lover - and one of the few free activities in London.||November 25, 2018
950NikkiB||50||Visited here again, it’s a great food market where you can get all sorts of different food. I got a vegetarian curry to take away for a quick lunch, it was absolutely fab. My friends got a duck ciabatta which they told me was fab! I love this place, great for people watching, lots of hustle and bustle||November 25, 2018
christel||40||Not been for a while so fought our way through the street food tourists to gaze upon the veg porn stalls. Always so well presented and who knew broccoli came in gold colour!||November 24, 2018
Ian C||50||When I first came to London (a long time ago), this was still a fruit and vegetable market, with pubs open 24 hours a day. Thank goodness that when the market moved it, the buildings were retained and developed with minimal alterations into the food and gourmet market that it is today, with the surrounding streets still full of restaurants, bars and other specialist food shops. The market has different zones, one with semi-permanent outlets, one with pop-up stalls, and a new building focussed on herbs.There are two excellent restaurants, Roast and Fish, and views out to Southwark Cathedral. The food is international, with a strong Scottish representation, and there are now even vegan burgers! Always worth visiting if you are looking for some new and unusual food and drink.||November 24, 2018
FUNINTHESUN0203||50||We were in London for a week and one of the spots we had to hit was this Market. The food is delicious. We had empanadas, oysters, chicken curry, risotto and whiskey. There was so much more food that we were just full. So a few things before you head out. Don’t get full with the first spot you hit. There was five of us and when we arrived we were really hungry and we had one to many oysters. The rest of the time we would buy a plate and share it. There is so much to taste that you need to slow down and pace yourself and enjoy everything they have. They have cheeses, cure meats and a lot of other stuff. We will definitely go back but this time we know what to do. A good tip is to take cash with you. It makes everything much easier. Also I would take a backpack or small bag because their our small places to purchase gifts and such. Enjoy!||November 22, 2018
promlass||50||This is a highly recommended place to visit if your hungry. Food from all around the World. You can but flowers veg cheese spices from around the world. ||November 21, 2018
Prinsliii||50||This is absolutely my all time favourite place in London. I go here every chance I get. Although the food is not cheap the quality is amazing and the atmosphere is great. I would recommend coming here hungry as there is plenty of different things to try. My favourite is the burger right at the entrance of the market.||November 21, 2018
ajt_austria||50||This is a must if you love your food, wine, ales or markets. Borough Market is a vibrant collection of stalls selling top notch foods, spices, ales etc etc etc. The atmosphere is fantastic and the experience is one to savour. I wish this place was on my doorstep, because I'd be here every other day!||November 21, 2018
kosh2||50||they would have popped out. Great food market (upmarket types) and street food. If you love cheese come here. Great for people watching too.||November 20, 2018
Chris R||50||Hugh choice of food to eat and fresh to take home, Typical market as they should be or used to be fresh produce and something for everyone. Loved the mushrooms,cheeses, veg, meats pastas and great atmosphere can get busy but always friendly advice given by store holders||November 20, 2018
ShawnC-NJ||50||We found this ten minutes after eating and wish we woulda known. This was a great market with whole pigs, thai food, bread, pastries and much more. You cannot miss this place.||November 19, 2018
carreraleighd||40||Horrifically overcrowded most of the time, Borough Market still offers up some great food. I'm a particular fan of the mac 'n' cheese place and the steak sandwiches served up from the butchers. Yum! Lately I've also been taken with the place that does lamb wraps.||November 19, 2018
480amandan||40||We turned up at 10am ready for something for breakfast. Unfortunately most of the stalls weren’t serving breakfast foods or any food at all - other than produce that is taken home to use to prepare food. Still worth visiting, just not before lunchtime.||November 19, 2018
Axel C||50||Delicious food, delicious colors, delicious smells, delicious prices, delicious views, what else can I say?Don't miss it!||November 19, 2018
albe972||50||wanna buy anything that concerned food from any part of the world ??? you should pass here ...everything is here....certainly you will find your preferred food :D .it's like a permanent universal expo for food. you can also visit southwark cathedral.....that is very close...||November 19, 2018
Martino C||50||An original place and an original idea. Unfortunately everything is sold at inflated prices. My solution is to go on a sunny day, buy some exotic take away food and go sit along the river or in the gardens of the church.||November 19, 2018
MULCASTER2||50||Borough Market is just an amazing place, especially if your a foodie like us. The fantastic little stores with their specialised produce are just a joy to visit - so easy to get here on the tube by getting off at London Bridge or around £12 in a taxi from the city centre. The whole feel of the place is magical, loads of little cafes and bars around with some amazing food places to try. I just love the street food here - it’s outstanding and well worth the couple of quid it costs.  If your in London, you would be foolish not to visit here ||November 19, 2018
sam b||20||Very disappointing breakfast Iam afraid the bacon was very fatty had asked for it well done but think they had mass cooked it all it was barely warm and the toast was hard as if it was few days old and scrambled eggs cold and had split so all together not good at||November 18, 2018
46smitap||40||This is a must visit market for all the food lovers out there. A bit difficult to locate but once you get the smell of all the food, you will be able to find it soon. We tried food at the ethiopian stall and it was amazing. With a host of international food stalls this place was absolutely buzzing on a Saturday afternoon. Right from vegan option to burgers you had so much to choose from. A great place to try global cusine for a very affordable price. This place also sells fresh fruits, vegetables and other local produce. Make sure you head down to this place on your next London tour.||November 18, 2018
Joanna Victoria Y||50||Hip horray to Borough Market, all of the food stands are using Compostable packaging or sustainable good show.On top of this the selection of food is outstanding, I was with five others and we all were very happy with our choices.I love this place and highly recommend it to any visitor to London, if want to understand a bit of what we brits love to eat and drink its here.From great fish and chips to line caught oysters to amazing cheeses and breads its all here.Just ask someone when you exit London Bridge tube as so many exits and they'll point you in the right direction.Go early though so you can decide what you will eat.We want at 11.30am on a Tuesday and it was getting busy as we ate our lunch in the main eating bit inside.There are toilets outside plus an eating stage but is rather chilly outside so get there early and you can eat inside.Happy eating xxx||November 18, 2018
sabrinasT7425YA||40||A variety of fantastic food and parties, lovely shops but an energetic vibe. However the amount of people you'll find there on a Saturday is insane. As much as I enjoyed visiting there, I'd definitely not return on a Saturday. ||November 17, 2018
Stefanyyeo||10||Please avoid Maria's Cafe in Borough's market. The fat lady behind the counter is rude. I was there with my son. I ordered a burger & a cup of coffee from her which then allowed me to sit at her cafe. My son who bought a bowl of mussels then came to join me at my table. This fat lady spoke very loudly behind the counter (for all to hear clearly) that were not supposed to have other food except her food when seated in her cafe! I explained that I bought her food & my son is seated with me. Again she hollered the same thing. Such a petty & arrogant attitude! It was embarrassing that I decided to find another place out of her cafe to sit & eat with my son. ||November 17, 2018
Ejazakbar||50||Great place to visit if you are near by for a good lunch either if you are fancy for organic food from the farmer .Varieties of stalls,mostly organic pure food cheese,Vegetables,Oils,Milks,Honey and food stalls Worth visit there also if you are a good photographer...||November 16, 2018
Trek638548||40||Just a very interesting place, lots of food to see and sample, although there is much more to discover. If you like markets whether wholesale or retail, this is the place to see.||November 16, 2018

prati355||30||Different stalls and wide variety of fruits vegetables and food eateries. Bit overpriced as per collection||November 15, 2018
Sharon R||50||I had read about this market in an inflight magazine and decided to check it out. WOW!! What a cacophony of sounds, smells, food offerings large and small from artisan makers and cultures, people watching, etc. I had some paella that was great (and fabulous photo ops of the pan and the staff!). My husband bought some aged parmesan cheese from the Ham and Cheese Company stand. We bought Turkish delight candies. Just a fun visit. We ordered the Borough Market cookbook to continue our connection with our super fun afternoon visit. HIGHLY recommended for visitors and locals alike.||November 15, 2018
Nese Y||50||Good show of street food of London. Always crowded. Lively. You must live it. Easy to reach. Shop and eat.||November 15, 2018
Toff-the-lop||40||Its a food market, nicely set out a bit of more or less everything, Cheese, Hot Cider, Meats, Fish, fruit, Breads, Cake, Noodles, rice, oils, coffee, Teas and other stuff, some stalls are busy but foolishly have 1 person serving, theres a gluten free cake place, but the banana cake we had was dry and a tiny slice at £3, Pretzels more like it at £2 a pop, Thai sweet at £3.99 for 8, great smells and aroma's, went pre-lunch time so would like to think some busy stalls get more staff at lunch, not many places want to change notes either.Nice place, 10 mins from Monument Tube across London Bridge...which as a point of fact was NOT falling down.||November 15, 2018
karencA6283NY||50||No visit to the south bank is complete without a wander round the market. It’s a great experience. Food and drink options are plentiful, and varied. I bought Persimmon fruit! ||November 14, 2018
sallypilates||40||Busy busy busy! Lots of stalls selling a huge range of tasty snacks and meals. Lots of vegetarian and gluten free options too.

llauriegold||40||One of many Markets we checked out in London; thoroughly enjoyed it! Shopping, food, and people watching were all great. NOT so great: lack of seating once you purchased food. Best chicken and rice curry I've ever eaten. Look around first, then go back and nosh.||November 13, 2018
38sally||50||A historic London market that has been transformed into foodie heaven. Street food, upmarket eateries, specialist food shops and restaurants, and the most wonderful range of food stalls. Until recently it was a downmarket wholesale market, so this is a massive change, and some of old Southwark is still there. Once you've enjoyed the food, you can visit Southwark Cathedral, the Clink ancient prison and walk the river walk along the south Bank. Something for everyone.||November 13, 2018
rattila1987||50||A great place to spend a day and discover different high quality food from England and the rest of Europe. Spent an amazing half day there strolling around. Great to see people taking pride in their products, sample a lot of different food and engage in interesting conversations. We had a great kofta from “Great goat”, a fruit juice, fish and chips at fish! and great doughnuts at Bread ahead. Our tip: Oliveology, with great Greek nuts, dried fruit, honey and olive oil and very friendly staff.||November 13, 2018
FJB774||50||This was foodie heaven. Living in Singapore if I cook its pot luck as to whether I can obtain all (or sometimes any) of the ingredients. This place had the lot and the samples proffered are great. The choice is staggering and the quality all looks good. Sadly I couldn't just fill a shopping bag and bring home!||November 12, 2018

warrickg2015||40||A great place to stroll and enjoy the many stalls and stop and have lunch. It is interesting and there is so much variety in what is on offer in the stalls in the market. The is a real positive energy and bustle about the place and you can get a casual meal from one of the stalls or a more formal meal at one of the restaurants in or around the market. Well worth a look if you are in the area and perfect to stop in for a decent lunch and a drink.||November 12, 2018
V8496QVsaraha||40||If you are into your food, or just want a place to sample some amazing food, then take the time to visit Borough Market. We went last Saturday, and while we did have some dreadful weather in the afternoon, the produce of some of the sellers was outstanding. From bread, to meats, to cheese, to nuts, to honey, to vegetables, to spices, it does have it all. I guess one thing is you do have to be careful because it is very expensive and you are paying quite a bit, but what we bought and sampled was really good quality. I tried a little bit of Buffalo Mozzarella and I can be completely honest and say it was the best I had every tasted, and that included in Italy!Had lunch there too, a venison filled flatbread with homemade pickles which was delicious from one of the food vendors - think it was Goat and Co - or a name like that, it was amazing!The only downside for this place is the lack of seating, it is knackering walking round and there are loads of people doing the same thing, so you do need to be mindful of that, not the sort of place to go if you have walking problems, or back issues.Having said that, apart from the downpour we suffered, it was lovely to visit and I probably would have stayed a little longer if it hadn't been quite so dreadful, would definitely visit again, but I think I might save up a little first, so I can indulge in Foodie Heaven a little more!!||November 11, 2018
BetinaC36||40||This market is fantastic. The food is really good. And the different types of foods are plenty. Try the mushroom on toast and a freshly made juice. It was wonderful. There are so much to see and taste from all over the world. ||November 11, 2018
Pat D||40||One of the largest open market places in London. If you are looking for fresh cheese, bread, vegetables, honey, humus, baskets, and so much more and are near the London Bridge (south side) this is well worth a visit! Bring a market basket you'll fill it up. The also have sealed jars of all kinds of goodies you can mail back to the States or take with your 'checked' baggage on the plane! Many boutique shops and restaurants beside and nearby. Within walking distance of The Shard.||November 11, 2018
eunhae1987||50||My only take away is that I wish we went with more people. There were so many yummy things to try and our only limitation was that we only had 2 bellies to fill.This market had an array of ready to eat foods and specialty stores. We managed to stop by and try the meat pie, scotch egg, doughnuts, roast sandwhich, and some fruits from the produce store. We took away some cheese and bread as well, all of which were delicious.It gets super crowded on saturday and it was hard to get around... but that's part of the charm.Bring friends and get your eating on. Step to the back of the tents to actually eat so you're not standing in the queues, stopping other people from getting through. ||November 11, 2018
cathalmacdomhnaill||50||This place is a must visit" vibrant flowing with energy and good vibes" it's like a kid in a sweet shop/ TOY shop,,the atmosphere is infectious" spoiled for choice with all sorts of street food" love the spit roast to the paella , the wide range of breads,cheeses,oils , and so much more could take up the whole day just wandering around,||November 11, 2018
RKRhodes||50||Bustling outdoor market that's been around longer than the USA. Located steps from the London Bridge underneath a railroad overpass, this market is jammed with more than 100 vendors offering a wide variety of food, drink, and many other products -- too many to list. Anything you're likely to be looking for in a market -- street food, a cafe, a cold drink, candy, spices, fresh flowers, fish, fruit & veggies, gourmet meats & cheese -- it's all here. You've got to simply take the time to wander around, to see what you can find. We arrived during lunch hour on a warm sunny day -- so it was not surprising that the market was quite busy. During our visit we sampled takeaway pie & mash from The Pieminister, along with some goat's-milk ice cream for dessert. Both were delicious. We also enjoyed listening to the street musicians. Looking forward to our next visit!||November 10, 2018
Mademoiselle_Elli||50||We've been to Borough Market the first days, it is really really nice to go there, also for an own little snack and lunchbreak. Its not only the food and stalls but also the whole atmosphere of this place, that is really nice.I would totally recommend it.||November 10, 2018
pakopichardo_||50||Great spot to eat like local food , there are so many options . We choose a Roast Beef Sandwich with some chips from “Roast to go “ , delicious. We might come back before leaving ! ||November 10, 2018
jilliano672||40||Haven't visited Borough market before so we popped in en route to The Tower of London to see what it was like. There are lots of food stalls catering for all nationalities + cake & bread stalls too. It was very busy so we didn't stop for long, it was very interesting but we did not have time to stop & sample any of the food.||November 10, 2018
Discover23024072244||50||There's Plenty of street food vendors to choose from, like burgers, grilled cheese, pasta, curry and pot pie. And of course lots of dessert options to satisfy your sweet tooth - cookies, brownies, cake, macarons, donuts, chocolate and fudge, just to name some.I visited Friday late afternoon and Saturday morning and the market wasn't very busy at either time. I'd imagine lunchtime being more lively.Recommended||November 9, 2018
apritchy||50||I have been here a few times for a bite to eat and it has never failed. Wonderful atmosphere and great food. A huge variety to choose from but the pies are a must try, they are amazing. ||November 8, 2018
amy10539||40||Borough Market is a bustling market located in the shadow of Southwark Cathedral. It’s a fun market to sample foods, enjoy a meal, or people-watch. The Borough Market Shop sells great, colorful affordable souvenirs such as canvas bags, aprons, etc. ||November 8, 2018
Arotake||50||Great place to wander around and to have lunch or dinner. Has a real buzz to it and it still holds the feel of a traditional market.||November 8, 2018
Movarip||40||At the end of London bridge walk down the steps at the right side and walk few minutes we reach the Borough Market. And if you step down at the left side then it will be a nice walk on the bank of Themes and in about 10 minutes we reach the Tower Bridge.Unfortunately, not knowingly, i reach the Borough market on Sunday and it was closed. However, there were a few eateries were open on the roadside but not in the market. There a tele-film shooting were going on inside the market on that Sunday.||November 8, 2018
moshiko77||50||Beautiful food market, many kinds of food made to eat on place and can be bought to take, you will find vegetables, see food, meet, cheese, all kind of mushrooms, Indian, Thai, and more.. the only problem is to choose because all smells good||November 7, 2018
BrionyParrott||50||We have recently been to London for the weekend and decided to walk from Trafalgar Square to Tower of London - via the Southbank. This is a fabulous walk (even in the rain) and to then discover this hidden gem is class!!! So many food stalls to chose from - and all freshly cooked! Will definitely be going back on our next visit ||November 7, 2018
Anna E||50||My sister and i were in London last summer and went to the Borough Marked weekly. We loved the food / diversity. Would 100% recommend to any tourist.||November 7, 2018
monideepad||50||The Borough Market is one of the largest and oldest food markets in London. Incredible as it might sound, the truth is that it dates back to the 12th Century. It is located in Southwark Street and Borough High Street, London; in close proximity to the Southwark Cathedral and the southern end of the London Bridge. Although the Borough Market was, until the 20th century, a wholesale market and the main supplier of vegetables and fruits to the retail greengrocers; today, it mainly sells speciality food items directly to the general public.It is a known fact that apart from the local produce, food items that are ‘traditionally’ European are imported from the concerned countries and are sold at the Borough Market and that stallholders from across the length and breadth of the United Kingdom come to trade at the market. Amongst the products on sale, are the common as well as exotic varieties of fruits and vegetables, wide range of cheese, fresh, frozen and packaged meat and game, river fish as well as sea fish, baked breads, cakes and pastries.The Borough Market is in Zone 1and is accessible by train, mainline as well as underground, London Bridge and Borough being the nearest stations. It can also be reached by bus or car though there are no car parks in the Market, there are a couple within walking distance.Monday and Tuesday are Limited Market Days when the food stalls with only a few produce stalls along are open. Wednesday to Saturday are Full Market Days when all the stalls are open. Opening hours are from 10am to 5pmThe market is closed on Sunday except in December when it remains open all seven days of the week.The entire market area is a no smoke zone. It allows only guide dogs.After entering through the gates, to start with, I was beckoned by the Gated Garden which was a very pretty sight with flowers and plants of all shapes and colours, seasonal and perennial as well as garden ornaments.While I was lost in my love for blooms, I was warmly invited by a young boy to visit his stall, the Alpine Den. There was an array of nicely arranged packages of many European styles of cured meats like air-dried beef, smoked sausages, mountain salami and a special ham with a Protected Geographical Indication. I bought a small ready to eat combo-pack of venison meat, pork and beef. The Spice Mountain was my next stop and I was appalled at the huge range of spices, herbs and blends that was stocked up. There were regular use as well as rare spices sourced from different countries like India, Spain, Mauritius.I stepped towards the famed and original Bread Ahead stall, that apparently worked hard to make everyone who stopped to take a bite feel that they had enjoyed a Michelin-starred experience on the street. They eventually opened a bakery school with the mission of bringing fine baking to the masses holding baking classes for amateurs as well as professionals. The aroma of freshly baked bread was too tempting to resist and I got drawn to the stall with the glass-fronted bakery providing a view of master bakers hard at work.I tries the famous cheese and olive sticks, crispy, crusty on the outside with the delicious filling of crunchy baked cheese and salty olives. I also tried one of the awesome doughnuts that Bread Ahead is famous for.Not much fond of sweets, I wanted to have something savoury, so stopped at the Oliviers’s Bakery for a Rosemary Focaccia which was as good as it looked.My eyes caught sight of an elderly lady who looked very much from the subcontinent, at the stall named Temptings with the tagline, ‘something to remember’. She was seated behind the counter holding neat rows of bottles sealed with the goodness of a wide range of pickles, savoury chutneys and fruit chutneys and a few bottles to taste from. I had a bit of a chit-chat with Mrs. Sandhu, a stalwart in Punjabi cuisine who prepares the pickles and chutneys in her Hitchen Kitchen and sells them at Borough Market..I was intrigued to know about the stall which read its name as Food & Forest and was impressed to learn that the food items at the stall offer the many benefits of agroforestry. The nuts sold here sourced from farmers who spearhead sustainable development.Wherever I looked, my eyes would get glued because everything looked amazing, the tastefully and colourfully stacked varieties of fresh vegetables, the piles of heirloom tomatoes, the different types of mushrooms available in all sizes, shapes with colours ranging from off-white to brown, and black. One cannot miss the Turnips Borough Market, one of the many incredibly attractive fruit and vegetable stores at the market. Then, there is Ted’s Veg There is a large number of seafood vendors at the Borough Market, with a good selection of fish (Cornish Day Boat Fresh Fish), crabs, lobsters, oysters, mussels, squids, diver-caught scallops, octopus and smoked fish products too. From Boat to Borough, Shellseekers Fish & Game, Applebee’s Fish, Furness Fish Markets are some of the popular vendors.When it came to meat, poultry and game, the names of vendors that have stuck to my memory are the Rhug Estate, with their Welsh farm products and the Wild Beef West Country Farm which sells rare-breed beef from Devon.If one is keen on exotic meats, The Exotic Meat Company Ltd. would be the answer with options of freshly made burgers of kangaroo, ostrich and crocodile meat. At the Borough Market, there are plenty of traders of fine English cheeses, and I decided to walk around taste some. My first stop was Heritage Cheese, known to have brought fine Italian cheese to the Borough Market. They now source excellent cheese from across England and Ireland. I tasted a small piece of Quicke’s handcrafted, naturally extra matured for 12 to 15months, cloth bound vintage cheddar cheese, it was mildly rich and buttery with a burst of flavours which was strikingly different from the robust, earthy flavour and distinctive tang of the goat’s cheese from Nantwich.At the Borough Cheese Company which specialises in Comte cheese of Eastern France. I was told that this relatively firm cheese which can be sliced, cubed or grated is great for cooking. I loved the slightly nutty flavour and creamy texture.I could not resist stopping at the Borough Olives which offered a visual treat of cauldrons full of olives of different sizes, colours and flavours. They also have a good stock of different varieties of Olive Oil.At Free From Bakehouse, cupcakes, regular as well as vegan and gluten-free cookies were being sold like hot cakes. I got a small parcel of Double Chocolate and Salted Peanut Cookies to take along.The colourful Fresh Fruit Juice stall served fresh juices, lemonades, smoothies and shakes. The rows of glasses with the colourful contents was a delightful sight indeed. It was time to savour some Street Food that Borough Market is known for. The sight of the giant sized woks with Traditional Chu Chi Chicken, Seafood Paella, Lamb liver, Steamed Mussels, Sautéed Mushrooms and Crisp Calamari Roundels attracted many like me. Walking around, wondering what best to do next, I headed to Roast and stood there admiring the rib of beef sandwich, the freshly made pastas, the game meat burgers and sandwiches. Finally, my son and I decided to split the famous duck confit sandwich from Le Marché du Quartier between us. The duck, cooked in its own fat was oozing with flavour its fall apart tenderness was almost similar to the texture smoked pulled pork. The nicely buttered halves of the flat crusted Italian bread roll with a few sprigs of rocket, and a generous portion of the tender duck confit and my sandwich was ready. The taste of this succulent sandwich lingered on my tastebuds for a while but will linger in my memory all my life.It would be worthwhile to mention that there are two main event spaces, the Three Crown Square and the Market Hall, which are open outdoor spaces but sheltered by Victorian glass and ironwork roofs. These venues can be availed on non-trading days for hosting such events like promotional events, launch parties, award ceremonies, fashion shows, wedding receptions and have even been approved l for civil marriages.The best thing is that these two places offer toilets in site.At the end of my tour of the Borough Market I came to the conclusion that the things are not cheap at the Borough Market, but they are of very high standards and quality. There were many more delicious things that I would have loved to eat at the market, I was spoiled for choice but I realised that had I got carried away, I would have inevitably burnt a large hole in my pocket.All said and done, when in London, spending a few hours eating through Borough Market is a great idea.I thought to myself that the next time I would keep three things in mind... firstly, to starve myself from the previous day so that I would be able to eat more; secondly, I would register for a baking class at Bread Ahead and thirdly I would buy and bring back loads of stuff so that I could fulfil my dream of cooking at least one solid meal with the exceptionally, extraordinary, excellent and exotic produce sold at the market||November 7, 2018
O6473BHpeterm||40||If you wish to hear, look, eat at and enjoy an English food market this is the place for you.Just of the main city thoroughfare is a market with a great deal of character based still on the mediaeval street pattern.There are few appetites which will be able to resist the fare that is offered. Look out for the Klink as well one of London's oldest prisons plus the Golden Hind ship of Sir Francis Drake fame. Go to the river and look for the Globe theatre and St Paul's Cathedral.||November 7, 2018
majblomqvist385||50||We took the bus 139 from Regent Street to Borough Market, you can pay the busfare with your Debit card on the bus. Charges £1. 50Bus 139 to Waterloo, its a nice ride, as you pass Trafalgar Square, Summer House Waterloo Bridge and Waterloo Station. From there it's a short walk to the Market... We went for the cookies, bread cheese and ofcause the chocolate, real chocolate.... Give it a go when visiting London.... ||November 7, 2018
Juliana T||50||There are loads of food options in Borough Market, but honestly my fav are the Argentinian empanadas at Porteña and its neighbor Richard Haward’s Oysters.The empanadas are perfectly baked, juice, in a crispy crust, seasoned to perfection. Absolutely fantastic. And then there’s dessert, or postre, if you fancy a sweet. Dolce de leche! It’s heaven.Oysters are also what always take me back to Borough market. Richard Haward’s oysters are simply fantastic.||November 7, 2018
Barry T||40||This is Londons premier fresh food market. Set on the south side of the Thames at London Bridge. The market snuggles up to Southwark cathedral which is worth a visit in itself.The market is a covered area with examples of some of the UKs best foodstuffs on sale. During the day it becomes increasingly busy with tourist groups so my advice is for a late breakfast at one of the many restaurants surrounding the market then a relaxed walk around to find some treats to take away.||November 7, 2018
Nina P||50||On my visit to London, I found that I often ended up at the Borough Market for lunch, it is pretty central to all the attractions and a great place to hang out. I love the small pies, handmade ice cream, fresh fruit juices, coffee, tea, and many specialty stands for cheeses and other delicacies. There are also craft items and artists wares.||November 6, 2018
a250gpguy||50||Honestly the best street food in London. Simply amazing. The Mediterranean wraps are not to be missed nor are the cheeses, meats, spice merchant or produce. A great place for daily menu buying.||November 6, 2018
Traveller332015||50||Borough Market can be accessed easily by bus or tube. It is an amazing place to see, smell and taste foods from around the world and home grown too. If you love food, you'll love this market.Bear in mind that Saturdays are always incredibly busy.||November 6, 2018
Claire D||40||A great places to find fresh world produce to sample, to try, to buy from herbs and spices to ham to jam to fresh fish to fresh pasta youll find it here with smaples galour too well worth a visit any day of the week also used in many film sets too||November 6, 2018
Ecojanie||40||Artisanal food galore. Get yourself down here if you want to find great food. Tasty, multinational and with a great atmosphere. Easy to get to and a good afternoon or evening can be spent here.||November 6, 2018
Mariza D||50||A great place for a foodie! It's fun to visit and try a different type of food, teas, coffee, wine, olive oil and many more! ||November 5, 2018
GINAH1965||30||I'd hoped to show friends some of the different things that London had to offer. This market was very expensive for what they offered, charging higher prices for smaller portions.It was interesting and showed the wide range of cultures living side by side in London, however overcharging our tourists makes sure I wont be bringing my friends back unless they get value for their money||November 4, 2018
Ichecked||50||Lots of choices here. We really liked Kappacasein for the grilled cheese and the fish and chips place called Fish. There are ethnic food options, vegetarian options, fresh fruits and veggies, and chocolates, bakeries, and donuts. The market is spread around a number of corners, keep exploring and you will see more stalls. Bring cash since many don’t take cards, but most items are pretty reasonable in cost.||November 4, 2018
123_Sussex_UK||50||I stopped off here whilst on a quick trip to London. It is under cover and somewhat discreet. It is very photogenic and no-one seemed to mind people just walking around taking photos. There is plenty of choice of some speciality food and drink to be had. It was not too busy when I was there on a Wednesday lunchtime but I guess that's not the peak time.It's a short walk from London Bridge Station so if you are waiting for a connection and have time to do the ten minute each way walk then go for it; you won't be disappointed.||November 4, 2018
jesusl508||50||Facinating market and food is fresh and pleasurable to the taste bugs.one place not to miss if you still have ample time.||November 4, 2018
smileyexplorer||50||Love this market and such an enjoyable way to spend time eating, browsing and shopping for great food/drink. Always bring visitors here. Try samples, chat to the vendors and enjoy :)||November 4, 2018
3550LOS||50||I love coming to Borough Market and there is a wonderful array of food to try. But be warned: on a Saturday you can hardly move and any dream you may have of casually wandering around to try all sorts of interesting food, will be quashed as soon as you realise you can hardly move and will have to join a very very long queue to buy anything. Come early or late! I bought amazing honey from wild thyme flowers (much tastier than anything from a supermarket) a selection of cheeses, a spiced apple mustard and dried chillies in a nice box as a Xmas present. I also had a Portuguese pork sandwich which was delicious. My partner indulged in 6 large Colchester oysters from Richard Haward and he said they were the best he had ever had. ||November 4, 2018
Gav_jo||40||This has to be seen to be believed. Very busy food market with a good atmosphere. Lots of sampling to do- especially cheese and paté. So much to choose from. German bratwurst were delicious. However it is London - nothing’s cheap!!||November 3, 2018
Charl-DD||50||One of the best markets in London or Europe. Great selection of producers, food, drinks. Quality Good restaurant around as well||November 2, 2018
Melbguy3805||50||Decided to go check out Borough market and was really impressed. Lots of different food stalls.Was extremely busy though.Definitely check it out if your in London.||November 2, 2018
donaldh886||50||If you are a chef or foodie, THIS place will rock you to the core! I can’t share all the pics I took here! We tasted our way thru the market and spent about two hours there. Wanted to spend more, but time constraints. Make sure you go here hungry cause you are going to want to try so many items! Highly recommended!!||November 2, 2018
DLFSanJose||50||You can’t miss this place. Given a cot my wife would have camped out in the market. Lots of stalls with a large range of products and food to eat. While there may have been several stalls with similar products, there was great variation in the products themselves such as high land cheese vs. lowland varieties . Best to go in the morning as the afternoon, even on a weekday, gets real busy.||November 1, 2018
raymondo848||50||Great choice of finest British meats, seafood,cheese,vegetables & cheese.Great patisserie goods.Have a light breakfast before attending & indulging In quality hot cooked food from around the world. Something for all ages & walks of life and even those strange folk that don't eat meat ;)Very safe & clean. Would highly recommend.||October 31, 2018
therealjug||50||London's best known food market-- and justifiably so. Cheeses galore, freshly baked breads and confectionery, venison burgers, grilled scallops, oysters, pastas, risotto, you name it, they have it. My personal favourite is the pork belly sandwich from Roast to Go-- porcine heaven in a bun for GBP 7.50.The feast this market dishes out is far from dying for-- it's worth being born again for culinary encores. ||October 31, 2018
Bluma123||50||This was unexpectedly one of the highlights of our trip! :) It is a very big market filled with just about EVERY type of food from ANYWHERE around the world. The vibe is great, and it was so much fun looking at (& tasting) the various exotic foods, as well as the good ole' familiar ones. Everything we ate was delicious, and the experience of hanging out with locals, sitting on a street curb whilst eating out of a box just added to the experience (there are restaurants as well for those who prefer to actually sit in a chair :) ). Don't miss it!||October 31, 2018
paulsymonds||40||Great food market mixed with plenty of international flavour. From unusual meat pies to huge ranges of cheeses. Close to all the main sites this is a great place to visit! Can be exceptionally busy at weekends.||October 30, 2018
Jim W||50||A great variety of food stalls to suit all tastes. A little bit expensive and the crowds make it difficult to appreciate the stalls. Not a large area to eat your food.||October 29, 2018
Amel111||40||I love this market as it has a lot of selection of stalls, you must try the grass smoothie and the oysters... Also a great place to do some fruit and vegetable shopping...||October 29, 2018
ljbunny||30||On our city break we didn’t get chance to visit here last time. We came this time on a Monday so the market was limited, lots of fresh produce still for sale. We had fresh juices and then mac and cheese and pulled pork. Not many places to sit and eat- unlike Camden. We did enjoy it but would maybe come when full market is on next time. We found it easy to get off at tower bridge rather than borough itself on the tube as it was actually closer. ||October 29, 2018
JSolitude||40||This is one of my favorite places on a visit to London. It oozes charm and although the market hall itself is nothing fancy, the atmosphere comes from the stalls offering all kinds of produce. It invites you to wonder around, gaze at the plentitude of colors and tastes.Beware however due to its popularity prices are elevated and you would spend far less at other less popular markets. The same remarq goes for some of the popular restaurants at this location like Wright Brothers, Roast and Fish! So, if you're travelling on a budget or are price conscious, come here for a stroll and shop and eat somewhere else.||October 29, 2018
884ronf||40||Borough Market contains a lot of stalls that sell food.The variety of cousins and food you can find over there is huge, from Pizza and French Fries to Indian food and Mexican food.I recommend to come over there to eat launch, so eat a small breakfast so you can taste different dishes over there.||October 28, 2018
tarap723||50||We visited the Borough Market on a tour. The tour was on a Thursday, and it was not packed.we went back on Saturday, and you could barely move there were so many people. Try to go during the week.This is an amazing find in London. If you are a foodie, you cannot skip this.Here are some places we tried:Bread Ahead Bakery and School- try the donuts. They are special.Fish - I don’t even like fish, and I thought their fish and chips were good. It was light and not oily. They have a stand and a restaurant. As our guide told us, they have won awards for their fish and chips.Ginger Pig - this is a butcher. Order their hot sausage role. It is smack your mama good. Sausage in a puff pastry. They are big enough to share. ||October 27, 2018
jamestK8324LT||50||Spend a fun two hours wandering with my 13 year old. Got the tube to London Bridge and then wandered through the market We tasted cheese, olive oil, and chocolate Some very high quality products and produce Also loads of street food options reflecting the diversity that makes London great. A brilliant way to spend a morning. ||October 27, 2018
tomski2001||30||Can’t really see the attraction of fighting your way through the hordes of tourists. The food for sale seems to be largely preserved meats or cheese and the cooked food doesn’t appeal as there is no seating. Plenty of good restaurants nearby. We have purchased some speck there which was very nice but really can’t see the appeal. ||October 27, 2018
917adamd||40||What a fantastic idea the Borough markets are, we accidentally stumbled across the markets looking for somewhere to eat as we could smell the aromas from the high street and decided to walk in.There is such a wide array of permanent and transient market stalls which sell heaps of different reasonably priced things. From artisan bread made locally to the finest Indian food there are heaps of options for everyone.The architecture of the building is also equally fantastic. A must do if you’re staying in south bank!||October 27, 2018
impulsivekiwi||50||This was a fantastic market to explore for a couple of hours. Great food stalls. My highlights were olive oils, an amazing cheese toastie and sampling lots of amazing teas! Well worth the visit!||October 26, 2018
Elle59||50||You can meander around here and take in the sights, smells and tastes of the world.Food for everyone, cheese lovers, meat eaters and vegans. Not cheap, but, then again good food is worth the expense.This is not your average daily market. It is for those delights in life that you want to taste, savour and enjoy. Worth the trip if you're celebrating a special occasion and want something special for your dinner table.It's a nice covered area of authentic architecture and paving slabs. Lots of languages spoken. Always busy, not great for people with mobility difficulties.If you only visit once you will not be disappointed.||October 26, 2018
robertmK6898CW||40||Lots of fascinating corourf food stalls each specialising in a it’s own variety of goodies: bread stalls, all sorts of weird (even rare) fruit and vegetables, sea-food (including massive oysters from Poole), mushrooms, truffles, cakes, cheeses. Every corner of this market offers an interesting surprise with the world over well represented.Loads of things to taste.||October 25, 2018
michele49johns||50||We wandered here to kill time before queuing up for an evening meal at Padella, but found ourselves tasting and purchasing attractively displayed goods and wishing we had rented a flat with a real kitchen so that we could make whole meals of the appetizing goods for sale here! It’s a great place to graze for lunch or dinner, or purchase ingredients to prepare your own! We’ll be back next time!||October 25, 2018
mcmomny||40||Wasn't in our plans to visit but as we were walking by we stopped and really enjoyed the atmosphere, the smells, the crowds, the food and the sightseeing!||October 25, 2018
s0phie61||50||Having just moved to London we decided to go to Borough market with some friends. It’s such a great place to go in any season - can’t wait for the next visit! Make sure to also check out all the food stalls too ||October 25, 2018
889kfirl||50||A relatively small but very boutique and special. Full of food and stalls offering tastings. The atmosphere is good and fun to walk around. Worth a visit!||October 24, 2018
Christine T||50||This is a great place to walk around, even if you are not stopping for lunch. The food all looks fantastic and there are lots of free samples||October 24, 2018
avlai889||50||This is the best place to go if you’re super hungry. We were here just to look around cos we already had lunch. Big mistake of eating somewhere before going to this place. You should come here on an empty stomach. So many things to eat and buy. Reasonable price for buying fruits. Will definitely go back there again.||October 23, 2018
keithcarolyork||50||A must do alternative to Camden market,spacious but busy a food and drink heaven well laid out and easy to navigate around such a diverse selection of food and drink ||October 22, 2018
dreamspeaker||50||I really enjoyed Borough Market. I had not realized that aside from food there were several other things for sale and that it seemed to be kind of divided into departments. There was a candy and pastries area, the hot food area, a produce area, a cheese area, a flowers area, and a spices and oils area. It's something of a maze to walk around, so I just encourage anyone visiting to keep walking until they think they've seen everything! It was crowded, even on a Wednesday at 2:30 in the afternoon, but still well worth the visit.I love near a city in the United States that is frequently said to have one of the best farmer's markets in the country (this is still true). I know a farmer's market is different than what Borough is, but Borough pretty much knocks the socks off of our farmer's market. If you like food and want to try something new, go there!||October 22, 2018
Jessica G||50||My husband and I weren't sure what to expect, but we were walking around the area (seeing London Bridge, etc) and decided to stop in. Thankfully, we hadn't eaten lunch yet. When you first walk in you see a bunch of different shops and vendors selling anything. We grabbed a beer and started to the right where a bunch of the food vendors were setup selling incredible food (meat pies, Indian food, Thai food, vegetarian food). We decided to buy something small from as many different places as possible so we could try more. It was a great way to try all sorts of delicious food. The market goes even further back than you initially see. There are vendors selling fresh fruits, veggies, fish, meats, cheese, spices, etc. You could spend hours here! It's definitely a must stop when you're in London (come hungry!)!||October 22, 2018
katevale46||50||Fantastic displays of all types of food from around the world. Loved the displays of pumpkins, squashes and mushrooms, but there's so much to see. Just after London Bridge on the south side of the river. Could have eaten so much from the freshly cooked stalls. Real diverse range of food and people. Surrounding small streets also have interesting range of produce, gorgeous little ice cream shop. Will definitely be going back.||October 22, 2018
haktus||50||packed with people, great diversity of food and drinks, roof for rainy days, great picks of different food, music played, opportunity to sit or stand, whatever you like best and the chatty Londoners here. What else would you want (at lunchtime)?||October 21, 2018
Iain W||50||The colours sounds and smells are amazing. From bread to cheeses. Hams to sausages. Fish stalls and honey. Cider wine and all types of food from all over the world. Hustling and bustling makes it even more exciting. Very clean and lovely traders. Some proper london traders and others from all over the world. The food was amazing lots of little tasters too. It's a must visit if you have a trip to London. My advice skip breakfast at the hotel and feast at the market. Fab place.||October 21, 2018
HappyWhen||40||We went on Friday around noon and there were so many people looking for lunch - still it took no longer than ~10 minutes to queue to food stands. We had lamb wrap and pie & mash with gravy, both very tasty. All kinds of foods can be found there from sweets to warm foods and veggies and berries. What an atmosphere there: the smells, colours and old surroundings.Next to the market there's a sort of famous pub The Market Porter which was also packed with lunch time workers meeting there. Overall very nice place to wander and look around. Not that large as an area so you can pop in to get something particular or go around for couple of hours.Some food stands only accept card payment, some also cash.||October 21, 2018
593gerardm||50||Wow ...what a great choice of foods from around the world to either buy and take home to cook or sit and eat. It's also free to walk around ||October 20, 2018
AnnahitaS||50||The food choices are so overwhelming that you just don’t know where to begin! If you are a foodie, this is the place to go. My head and nose was on a swivel. I wish this place was open for evening as well, but it’s not. Come hungry and leave satisfied. Absolutely amazing!!!||October 20, 2018
N_Yates14||50||Such a busy place with incredible smelling food! There is so much to see and many different options to eat! It’s worth a walk through at least, and I’m sure you’ll get up getting some treats!||October 19, 2018
dinks14b||40||Came here one afternoon after going to the Tower of London. It is worth taking the time and having a look if you are near by.Good mix of produce and products. A lot of options if you are looking for something to eat and drink there, or produce to take home.We walked around but decided to eat lunch in one of the restaurants attached.We found the food and drink inside a bit marked up but it was expected.Lots of people around.||October 19, 2018

Big variety everything from meet, vegetables, fish, cake, lemonades to specialised stores for olives or cheese. Highly recommended. ||October 19, 2018
patties188||40||What a crazy matrix like experience. This place was amazing and confusing all at once. Took twice looking around before choosing a lunch spot. So many choices. Trust me, get dessert....no disappointment. The pub has a restroom upstairs you can use also! ||October 19, 2018
jongeli||50||The smells, the colors, the noises, the tastes... Walking through the Borough Market is a pleasure for all your senses. Fortunately, we visited just after having eaten a generous breakfast. Had we come here hungry, I wouldn't have known how to choose between all the wonderful places this market features. There is something for everybody and from every type of cuisine. Whatever you fancy, the Borough Market likely has it. I only wish I had a place similar to this in my town...||October 19, 2018
PeikeCheng||50||There were so many fresh vegetables and seafoods, as well as honey, truffle, cheese and seasonings. And there were a lot of nice and fair-priced street foods.||October 18, 2018
ralphfromTexas||50||This market is a Foody's dream....Meats/Vegetables/Oils/Chees/ Fish/Food stalls. If you like food and cooking here' your place. It is located near the London bridge Tube station.||October 18, 2018
Debbie G||50||We had a great Saturday afternoon exploring the many food offerings and exciting atmosphere at Borough Market. There is every kind of food imaginable from seafood and shellfish to meats, smoothies, ethnics foods, pastries and, of course, traditional English Fish-n-Chips! A great way to spend part of a day!||October 18, 2018
FernandaSte90||50||Beautiful! Freshly cooked food in front of view! Cheap, good value and romantic setting makes this place perfect!||October 18, 2018
JoeNathan9249||40||Very fun to visit. I asked one vender to recommend a dessert from among many she was selling. She suggested a brownie. It was one of the very best brownies I've had anywhere.Many individuals and small businesses here - feels a bit like what it must have been like hundreds of years ago. If you are near HMS Belfast, Tower of London, this is just a short walk away, and lots of fun.||October 17, 2018
annakP3405QV||50||All I can say about my experience here was fun!!! I was on a mission to find a pasta place but lost my way around so many times. But I had the chance to look around the whole market it was lively and busy! Food looks delicious and was delicious and we met an awesome person from Mini Magoo! Definitely a place worth stopping by for a quick lunch and early dinner :)||October 16, 2018
SueBuenosAires||50||They recommended us this market and it is really worth visiting it.It has a huge, interesting variety of everything you can imagine. Cheese, meat, spices, bread, etc, etc. And a big choice of food to eat there,too.||October 16, 2018
dinabbrian||50||I really like visiting this amazing food market during the weekends, it's no frills very fun and total foodie haven. Some people don't know this but the market goes all the way back to the 13th-century, my family and I have been coming here for so long.||October 16, 2018
mike e||50||Borough market and a duck confit salad is a must for any visit to London. Of course all types of food can be gotten here and if you don't fancy the duck salad, have the duck sandwich. Highland cattle burgers and great desserts all around, there is something for all, even vegetarians. For those who have been, I didn't see the PIE MINISTER stall this time, pity. Oh, the killer vegetable/mushroom stall is now making a fantastic mushroom risotto featuring those famously beautiful shrooms. Get yourself some lunch here and a slice of banana cake and enjoy the people, smells and tastes of the best food area in London. The area people used to congregate at beside Southwark Church is closed off now, you will have to be more inventive with your seating. The tube stop is London Bridge.||October 16, 2018
sduris||50||I didn't even know about the Borough Market until I saw it while on a walking tour. So it definitely is one of London's hidden treasures. Consider it a farmers market on steroids. Any type of food imaginable is there. You probably need more than one day to fully explore it as there are so many different stalls. I was pretty impressed with the prices and selections. Great cheeses especially. One of my favorite stores is Spice Mountain. It's an amazing selection of spices! It's something you definitely want to check out!||October 15, 2018
0neRainbow||40||What a wide selection of foods from different parts of the world. A choice to please most. Take time to explore and experiment. Can be busy at times but certainly worth visiting and trying some interesting dishes and items. Don't miss it is you are visiting London.||October 15, 2018
Marsha S||50||The Burrough Market is located right under London Bridge. It is a huge outdoor (covered) market. Local Londoners shop here for beautiful fresh food, spices, teas, nuts, sweets, meat, flowers, and much more. The prices are quite reasonable, and I would definetely go EARLY (you can check their hours online) to beat the crowds. Almost every stall has samples so go hungry. You won't regret it. ||October 15, 2018
jehenson81||50||This market is the food market for the city or so I was told after I discovered my lunch plan no longer exists. So I ventured in. It was crazy in there at lunch time on a Friday afternoon. They have every type of food you can imagine. I grabbed a smoothie and a brownie (yes a very healthy lunch). Sadly I missed the risotto place until later in my exploration but it smelled heavenly. So don’t just go with your first choice, keep looking.||October 15, 2018
317roseb||50||Returned on 2 consecutive days as there is so much too see. Always busy..plenty of street food..stalls, tastings.Worth a visit.||October 15, 2018
Abdul M||50||If you are in London, this is one market you don't want to miss. IT is a must. Just walk around, see what you like, what you want to eat. I loved the fruit, very nice. Try the falafel, try the indian chaat, and much more. One more suggestion: There is a juice place, also a vegetable and fruit place, at the end of the market, if you get a chance try their Apple/Beet juice. It is out of this world. Wow, just wow! I drank 3 to 4 of them just walking around. I highly recommend those natural juices. There are other great flavors, but that was the best. I highly recommend this for those who want to enjoy a day out and just give yourself time at this market.||October 14, 2018
Leta7417||50||My Aunt and I visited Borough Market in October 2018 and loved it. It was my 7th time to London but first to to visit Borough Market. So many different foods and often times there are samples. Foods and dishes from all over. I got a falafel and she got some sort of mushroom dish. i will go back to this place. I am a picky eater and I easily found food I liked.||October 14, 2018
tarahR3925BA||40||A real traditional style old London marketBit pricey but Great atmosphere and seemingly good quality produceDon’t forget your ice bag as there’s nothing more annoying than seeing lovely fresh meat and fish and not being able to buy it!||October 14, 2018
ScottEP||50||Excellent food market with fresh and prepared foods. Busy and bustling with crowds. Lots of organic and healthy options to go along with the routine market fare. Meats, cheeses, desserts and fresh produce to choose from.||October 14, 2018
Allan L||40||A good place in London to explore the food scene here with a wide range of foods available. Some of the seasonal fresh fruits are cheap and plentiful. When we were there the figs were superb also we manage to get some doughnut peaches that were beginning to be the end of the season. Plenty of cheeses on offer. A good place to come over for lunch as well. Fresh seafoods are plenty.||October 14, 2018
kpmilly||30||Very expensive. Mostly average produce at grossly inflared prices. Such a shame could be great. Very very busy, we visited on a Friday afternoon must be mad on z Saturday.We ate lunch at Applebees a good fish restaurant ||October 14, 2018
983elodiem||50||This is a place you have to visit if you are a foodie!You can buy raw products but you can also enjoy a cooked meal!||October 14, 2018
familyHowes||40||Wow wasn't expecting it to be so busy to be honest we actually didn't know what it was all about. This place is huge and has loads of stalls selling things like fruit and veg to cider and hit and cold food and drinks this is probably only half of it as we found what we wanted then left as it was so busy we didn't get to really go around it. I would definitely recommend you take a visit here I personally wouldn't take my children here in fear they would get lost too easily! But as a couple we enjoyed it.||October 14, 2018
scottesandiego||40||We opted to swing by Borough Market for lunch one day, and it was great! There's basically two large halls - one with food for takeaway (aka, eat some lunch as you wander around), and another with food/spices/etc. to take home.The whole vibe was cool, and it was a bustling place at lunch time on a weekday. Recommended as an example of a fun public market.||October 13, 2018
dianamatroluxe||50||Some people start visiting London with sightseeing, but I would recommend you to go to Borough Market! This is one of the oldest food market. Here you can find everything Better to go during a weekend in the morning. Enjoy the delicious cuisine)||October 13, 2018
VegD33||30||If you’re just visiting London, Borough Market is a one time visit. You can enjoy some street food from around the world, buy some fresh cheese, vegetables or just take a stroll around. It’s very close to London Bridge. ||October 13, 2018
gom906||50||Had time to pop in here as we had extra time due to the shard being disappointing an glad we did !If you are a foodie, wow, so much to see/eat, with a great buzz in fact slightly too much as it was quite a crush but it was lunchtime.We were booked for a restaurant so couldn't indulge but next time, oh yes.....||October 13, 2018
stephgmolano||50||Pick a place to start and go everywhere! Tons of food stalls! I usually go for the goods though. The fresh market goods and gourmet items. They have truffles! I always love checking out the paella. I love buying Richard Bramble items. Fresh flowers. Must always stop by Borough Market.||October 12, 2018
mmlcbus||50||I just spent a long afternoon at Borough Market. It was everything that I imagined! Fresh, affordable and delicious food!!! Free Samples. Tons of vendors willing and happy to talk about their products. Foodie heaven! It was soooo tasty! The cheeses, the oysters, the paella, duck confit, truffle oils, jamón ibérico, so much deliciousness!!!. I had a great time and even though it was a solo visit I wasn’t alone at Borough Market. Such a wonderful place!!!||October 12, 2018
lenniemac||50||If I was left alone, with a huge bank account, I could have cleared it out here.Food was immense, smells delicious and so busy and pleasant and such a happy place. Fantastic fresh scallops and the cheeses and meat and............ just take lots of money. It is worth it||October 12, 2018
Lizzyloutoo||50||Fantastic foodie market, whether you want ingredients or to eat right now. Not cheap - I've paid up to £5 for a loaf - but always special! The veg are gorgeous, the bakeries enticing and there's always inspiration if you need to buy a present (chocolates, anyone?) Lots of specialists to help you choose cheese, or wine, or fish, or meats. The market is always packed and always fun.||October 12, 2018
nzsarah2016||50||stumbled across this market walking from the shard to london bridge - oh boy what a find. was such a fascinating place, so many amazing food options, you could spend days here! if youre a foodie visiting london this is a must visit - couldnt recommend enough. ||October 11, 2018
TWal1||50||Borough Market is a great place to buy your fresh fruit, vegetables, and meat. With a great range of vendors, including many who offer organic options, it is a wonderful market in central London. There are plenty of food stalls offering a great selection of choices for lunch. In fact, too many choices. The market is busy at lunch time and there is limited seating. However, this is a small inconvenience for the excellent food.Thanks for your vote.||October 11, 2018
SDubs24||50||I would do almost all my grocery shopping if I lived near this glorious market. There's so much variety! You can get baked goods, chocolate, coffee, tasty bites from international food stalls (we enjoyed a German brat and some potstickers), fish, vegetables, fruit, alcohol...you name it. We spent about 90 minutes here before hopping in line for some excellent lunch at Padella. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth a stop.||October 10, 2018
Katy B||50||This is a fantastic market, wish we had something like it where we live! Amazing spices at Spice Mountain, offered cheese to try, truffle oil and bread, the atmosphere was great very friendly & welcoming. Great coffee shop opposite||October 10, 2018
mizwhite||40||Met expectations. It was raining so....the trip was ‘that’ London day out ;)Nonetheless, we found a great tea place, lots of fresh produce stands, friendly cheese guys and herbs and spices galore. If you are a foodie like us, you are going to love Borough Market!! Plus, how can you miss an attraction that is over 1,000 years in the making?!||October 10, 2018
Elias I||50||The atmosphere is really nice, many kinds of food all over the world, cheese, drinks etc.A recommended place if you like to see the local market.||October 9, 2018
ranjanapathak||40||Borough market is very close to London bridge. Lots of multi product shops are here like fruit shops, vegetable shops, flower shops, eating places, souvenir shops, etc. Remains crowded specially on Sundays and holidays. It is mainly multi cousin fast food place and you will find here food verities from various countries. Price of things is on higher side.||October 8, 2018
TrevAmc||50||We stumbled upon the market while exploring and were pleasantly impressed. The smells and sounds are truly amazing. Easy to get to from London Bridge station ||October 8, 2018
17abbym||30||Borough Market has a nice atmosphere and a lot going on, which is why it would be a great stop for a group of people traveling together. There's something to appeal to everyone's tastes. The one thing it lacks by a wide margin is sufficient seating. If you buy anything other than handheld foods, you're out of luck. My husband bought a pricey fish and chips lunch from a stall that claimed to have won an award for that dish, but was disappointed. It was mediocre and had been sitting under heat lamps. Not worth paying a premium for. The breads and meats at other stalls were fresh and tasty, but again, you're paying a premium for it. Go to the Borough if you want a diverse foodie experience, but accept going in that you won't find any deals there.||October 8, 2018
Sjabena||50||Came through here on Saturday and was amazed at the size of the market and how busy it was. There was a huge array of stalls and they all looked great!||October 8, 2018
TheStormInaTeacup||50||Borough Market is an amazing place to visit if you love food. The stalls here have so much variety between them all that you will not be disappointed. Be warned that in the summer it gets very hot in here.||October 7, 2018
Lichfieldbloke||50||Saturday was my first visit to this market and I will certainly go again. Fabulous specialist food stands and great street food outside. Lost count of the different nations represented for food choices. And a great pub on hand too in the Market Porter. The area was packed with people and provided a great atmosphere on a Saturday lunch time||October 7, 2018
Neale1810||50||We have had intentions to visit Borough Market on many occasions but never quite make it - today we did!It’s quite easy to walk to from 2 or 3 different tube stations and is mainly under cover (important today as it was raining). The rain made it very busy in places as people were eating food in the dry areas. The market itself is brilliant - good selection of meat, veg, fish, cheese, bread as well as a number of excellent places to buy food to eat on the go. Our favourite food was the pulled duck wrap from a stall that specialises in duck products. It was £8 and had a huge portion of duck and salad inside. We also tried the oysters (great value at 6 for £10), cake and some bread.It’s not the cheapest way to buy food but everything was top quality.||October 6, 2018
157DavidM||50||Having been here several times I was amazed at the difference “a day makes”. Saturday was absolutely heaving. So many people it was a different experience to during the week. However it is the same fabulous food albeit at “fabulous” prices, but top notch quality. Highly reccomended for foodies ||October 6, 2018
joseph francis m||50||this is an excellent market offering a unique range of food and drink a lot of which you won't get anywhere else||October 5, 2018
Eleftheria G||40||I enjoyed spending my day on this market.It was lovely and the taste of the food makes me want to go back again||October 4, 2018
MaryC885||50||Such an amazing venue to visit. Your senses go into overdrive with the wonderful sights and aromas of the produce displayed. You are totally spoilt for choice of the produce you want to purchase to cook a meal. Or the cooked food on offer to eat on the go. It’s awesome. Every tourist should visit this wonderful market. With the added bonus of the incredible view of the Shard which is within touching distance.||October 4, 2018
kenh393||50||For me, this is definitely one of London’s great attractions. I always make sure to include a lunchtime trip when we have out of town guests. You’ll find some of the best street food and gourmet ingredients in town. The setting in an old wholesale food market in the heart of downtown London, cannot be beat. The variety of food options seems to get better and better. Make sure to come hungry. You won’t be disappointed.||October 3, 2018
Derek L||50||Well being a Londoner and sadly never ever there before. I am ashamed! So I took my girlfriend from Sweden with me and spent a few hours there. Talking to the stall holders, Tasting Cider, eating many different cheeses. Bought some wonderful Olives, Bread and Sun dried chilli tomatoes from De Calabria a brilliant stall!I highly recommend going and experiencing this wonderful Market.||October 3, 2018
HowardP568||40||Borough market is the oldest market in London. This is a very popular and busy area with a large array of food stalls and stands. There are many restaurants around the market and many of the vendors sell take home and ready to eat at the market foods.There is no entrance fee. Recommend. Hope this helps.||October 3, 2018
Jane R||50||I loved the vibrancy of the market.Being able to sample many offerings was wonderful- such a great way to be introduced to the foods of different cultures.I would suggest going in the morning before lunch in able to wander more freely.Would thoroughly recommend||October 3, 2018
GinnyKelowna||40||We enjoyed snacking and shopping at this local market, located under the train tracks. The market mainly features cheese stands, vegetable & meat shops, as well as take out street vendors with a variety of excellent foods such as risotto with mushrooms and paellas. We did our shopping for the evening meal and sampled a few snacks. The variety of mushrooms offered this time of year was amazing.||October 3, 2018
bruceywonder||40||Borough Market was one of the first places I visited for my first meal. Loads of foods to choose from and affordable prices (some maybe pricey) but still the food was great to eat. Its only a few minutes walk from the station. Many of the staff in the stores were very friendly. Definitely a place to visit.||October 3, 2018
julieS5819ZZ||50||food lovers - listen up. this place is a must visit for you. so many options! it's hard to decide what to get but i'd recommend grilled cheese for sure. everything is a little expensive though. pretty hipstery place||October 3, 2018
Janeyjou||40||Nice wander round this food market. Great selection if meat, fish,fruit,veg,flowers, olives,cheese,bread stalls. No good for us as we were sightseeing and staying in a hotel. Great choice if you were going straight home to your fridge! The meat in particular looked fabulous. Lots of street food stalls too, anything from burgers to paella to curries to confirm duck to Argentinan Street food, shame we had just had breakfast! Worth taking a look!||October 3, 2018
llanidloes999||50||Under London Bridge Station this HAS to be one of the best food markets in Britain.A large selection of British,artisan,ethnic and fresh products of the highest quality are available. When I visit I am like a child in a sweet shop! Just outside the market is a wonderful cheese emporium and after spending so much money one should go to the Market Porter for a drink in a traditional lively pub. On our recent visit just about ANY food could be purchased with the exception of a lettuce!||October 3, 2018
alex s||40||Borough Market is open form Tuesday's to Saturdays and at its very best in the mornings and lunchtime especially when the sun shines (yes that does happen in London)….it closes down around 5pm. You are unlikely to need the fruit and veg commercial side of the market but the great selection of food stalls ..everything from exotic asian curries to fancy pink meringues (including great British products like cheese , hams etc)….makes this the perfect lunch time pit stop after the Tate gallery and as part of soutbank river walk (best views of the city skyscrapers). Don't forget to go down to the lower levels around Southwark Cathedral for a feel of medieval London and some nice wine bars and food places. These are not the cheapest eats in town, explore Borough High Street and its environs if you are after a bargain. If you want something less touristy go to Brixton market ..its only a short hop on the tube from Borough or London Bridge.||October 2, 2018
lisaharte2014||50||The vast amount of amazing food at these markets and the friendliness of the stall holders was awesome a definite must whilst visiting London ... Chicken Pad Thai ||October 2, 2018
485suzanneo||40||This market is truly amazing. So much choice and many foods you would struggle to find elsewhere. The spice stall is my daughters favourite and spent a good 1/2 hour deciding between, hot, very hot and volcano chillies!! There are stalls selling bread, seafood, meat, fruit and veg, sweets as well as booze! All independent sellers, so helping small business. Unfortunately we do not live in London so buying fresh goods is not possible, but visiting to see and experience the market is great. There is also a huge selection of foods from around the world, cooked to eat on the hoof! Go early as it can get very busy and then you are struggling to pass through and don't get chance to see and taste!||October 2, 2018
ALaviniei||50||Forst visit was in January 18 when haven’t had time/big enough stomach to try as mich as i wanted so going back there this September was perfect decision. You have to try the oysters, the duck confit sandwich, paella and the stake and sandwich with that amazing beef meat they roast right in feont of you eyes. Make sure u don’t leave it for after 2pm as u might not find much on the stalls||October 2, 2018
violinnguy||50||Wonderful market with the most delicious food which should be on every traveller's must do list. Best sausage roll I've ever eaten! It's in a very interesting part of London so you can happily wander around for hours.Go!||October 2, 2018
Early20sStudent||30||Crowded and overpriced, there are many choices but while many good producers are present, I wouldn't say the quality necessarily justifies the price, especially when you consider the queues and mob which, personally, aren't really something I'd qualify as pleasant. Can certainly be missed if pressed for time in London, although if actually living here, might be good for a one time visit to discover different things (and find them elsewhere thereafter!)||October 2, 2018
ronj476||30||If you are looking for fresh, very fresh, produce, seafood, or meats this is the place. Stroll the market, check out the vendors, have lunch, and maybe even pick up some wine or small batch liquor.Nice way to spend an hour or two.If you like to cook, you will enjoy your time here.||October 1, 2018
Crystalrose54||40||This is the 2nd time I have visited Borough Market and it is always mobbed. There is so much to see here and eat & drink too!We only had a health juice this time and did not buy any food even though we had planned to take some home.The weather was fantastic so it attracted so many tourists you could not hardly move this day.||October 1, 2018
jillr406||50||If you are a foodie, don’t miss this market. If you are dieting, skip it. There are more cheese stalls then I have ever seen at any other market. You can eat food from all over the world all within a 1 mile radius. You can shop for ingredients for a gourmet or weekday night meal.||September 30, 2018
LVNVRichard||50||This place has loads of options, stalls with prepared foods, heat at home items, produce, cheeses, meats, bread, wines, pastries... I would have loved to stay long enough to eat multiple meals, but I was there only to gather some items for a picnic lunch. Everything I bought tasted amazing and was incredibly affordable. The strawberries I bought were perhaps the best I’ve ever had, and I loved the seeded sourdough, which I had never had before. Easily accessible by Tube. Check online for times, as the market was not open daily and closed in the late afternoon in August. This was a great alternative to the supermarket. ||September 30, 2018
georgen966||50||If you leave this market hungry, it is certainly your own fault. What an array of good, fresh variety of food. Every stall is just great in terms of variety, quality and friendliness of the staff. If there is one complaint it is only the enormous crowd. Enjoy to the max!||September 29, 2018

GeiWei||50||Lots of artisan food stalls, really nice fruit and vegetables, cheeses, meat and seafood. Several oyster stands with good selection of local and French oysters. Worth grazing your way through the market. Lots of choices. Had some freshly shucked oysters and a roast pork belly roll from Roast takeaway. Both were delicious. Other folk were tucking into mussels, confit duck wraps, paella etc...you could eat your way around a fair bit of the world...||September 28, 2018
Jessica T||40||The oldest veg and fruit market in London and still one of the best food markets of the city ! You can find a big variety of meats, cheeses, honey, truffles,.. to gluten free brownies and hot food prepared on spot. Everything is excellent, never been disappointed. it's not cheap but hey, great quality food is not free in London.There are bars and stores close to the market. Just one thing, you have to be patient as it is usually really busy.A must go !||September 28, 2018
Stevewfoster||50||If you like to browse artisan food stalls, eat street food (or better still, oysters) then you'll love this place.Great selection of cheeses, seafood, salamis, beer, cider, spices... There are also lots of pubs, cafes and restaurants in or adjacent to the market.I'm told it gets packed with people on a Saturday but we went on a Monday afternoon and it was great.||September 27, 2018
V3265FVdanm||40||Went on a weekday in September but it was around lunchtime so it was crazy. Pretty hard to really enjoy a whole lot but we did grab some great chow and did a little shopping. Worth the visit but I would try to go early. ||September 27, 2018
Loreen K||40||A great place to browse, and spend a few hours hanging out, meeting friends, having drinks, pucking up some food from a multitude of food stalls||September 27, 2018
Melkai_123||50||OMG this is the place to get your foodie on! Fresh cooked specialized food at stalls throughout the market. Wine, cheese, honey, donuts and more. Go and have a blast! Eat your heart out! Try Mushroom toast, crawfish mussels and more. ||September 27, 2018
lucianobotticelli||40||One of the most popular market, with food of countries of all the countries around the world: French Cheese, Italian Wine, Argentinian typical food. Really nice place to visit, i recommend to go around 6/7 pm when all the labours go to drink and eat something. Consider that the market is a little bit more expensive than the shops out the market.||September 25, 2018
BrendaH480||40||We were pleasantly surprised to see all the different food vendors available on a Monday afternoon In September! Food from all different nationalities and quite a diverse selection available even if you try the desserts you can’t go wrong!!||September 24, 2018

katherineesmith||50||Right neat the underground with so many sights and smells! Make sure you allow enough time to take a good look around the market, there's so much to see and you need to truly take in the atmosphere. You'll be spoilt for choice when it comes to sweet and savoury foods, it was a hot sunny day when we went (even better!) and was grateful for the water fountain to fill up our water bottles.||September 23, 2018
MaxChin||50||Conveniently located next to Underground waterloo station, once you exit the station, the market is just next to you, cant miss it. Abundance of food, including some asian food which quite nice actually. Had a couple of food, including some oyster recommended by the seller, taste fresh and good - i even had a chance to have "Malaysian curry" and as Malaysian, for us it is quite nice, what a pleasant surprise. Aside from this, a lot of local food there - we just dont have enough stomach to try all of them. Cheese, bread, coffee, seafood and a lot more is selling there - definitely a must go place. ||September 23, 2018

You can pass hours wandering around taking in the smells and tastes. It’s at one end of the South Bank so you can head past the Golden Hind and the Tate etc. vibrant part of London. ||September 23, 2018
Healinghands3||50||You need to spend at least 3 hours here. Just around the corner from London Bridge station and various bus stops. There really is a buzz around here and it makes you want to explore even more. We were lost through the corridors of stalls and best of all credit/debit cards were accepted. Tried different types of flavoured toffees, cheese made with Prosecco! Yum! Even tasted pulled salt beef burger, Ethiopian food had some interesting flavours and the chips from the famous fish n chip shop was out of this world! Yes I would go there again and again. There were also a historical sight at Pickfords wharf, The Golden Hinde and Winchester Palace. Definitely a must see and lots of scenic views. Love London it’s full of hidden gems at no cost at all!||September 22, 2018
GULLIVERHampshire||30||We were here on a day trip to the Shard, and had time to spare before catching our coach home. It appeared to be mainly food stalls, and as we were on a coach trip, we weren't really keen to load ourselves up with perishable items. However it was very interesting to wander amongst the various stalls, but it wouldn't be a destination I would visit again if not prepared to carry a cool-box !||September 22, 2018
np-lovetotravel||50||Amazing coffee - smooth and creamy, no bitterness!! And they have soya milk unlike a number of their competitors in the area. Will definitely go back as often as possible ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️||September 22, 2018
manya_girl||50||I could wander and eat my way through Borough Market all day! Come hungry and with plenty of time to wander.||September 22, 2018
Steven L||50||Our first visit to Borough Market was in 2015 and I was looking for something specific but was impressed by the variety and appeal of other vendors.For this trip my wife and I looked at the map on the website to see what might be available. Having said that , nothing can prepare you for the crowds and visual assault that you'll experience. The full market is open on Wednesdays through Saturdays and I'd recommend getting there early. My wife and I did and it gave us the chance to see what was offered and make good selections about what and where we wanted to eat.It is popular with tourists but what you'll find there must also appeal to Londoners. Plan well and be prepared to be excited by the food.||September 21, 2018
400keng||50||This market should not be missed. It is a collection of food vendors selling food products local to their location of origin, i.e., London, England, France, Italy, ... The food is excellent, all the way from the fresh breads, to local salt beef sandwiches, to the local scallops & mussels, and finally the pastries, they are to die for. Find the almond croissants they are amazing, I bought one and immediately bought another. This is one of the best values for your money in London, arrive around 11:30 and have lunch or brunch, you can't beat it.||September 21, 2018
619jeffry||50||The Borough Market has lots going on. It's adjacent to Southwark Cathedral, right on the River Thames. There's loads of fruit, vegetables,cheese and all the things you need to make an impromptus meal. Just get a baguette, some cheese and some salami and you've made a meal.||September 21, 2018
GreyHavens1||50||I've been visiting the Borough Market in London for years. Every time I am in the city I stop by for a cup of coffee at Monmouth Coffee Company, some bread from Bread Ahead Bakery, and cheese from Neal's Yard Dairy (there are so many types of cheese to choose from!) Fresh produce, pasties, spices, and many other stalls are located in the market and you can find food to suit just about every taste. Once I have made my purchases, I can sit outside Southwark Cathedral to enjoy my lunch. Then I feel like a real local Londoner. :-) It is amazing that there has been a market on this site for 1000 years (that is NOT a typo - one thousand years)! It is literally London's oldest food market. Definitely stop by on your next visit to London for a bit of history and some delicious food!||September 20, 2018
davetlg||50||I love food so I love Borough market - it was absolutely heaving with people on the Saturday I visited but it was all good natured and everyone seemed to having a good time - there is so much to experience, smoothies and fruit juices, prawns, squid, meats and cheeses, burger, paellas, you name it - it's here!Its a great place but maybe next time I'll go earlier an hopefully get a bit more space.||September 20, 2018
Annieroberts22||50||Well worth a visit! Senses go into overdrive. The smells, colours, tastes and sounds are wonderful. Lots to taste test. Things that you don’t see everyday. If your looking for something a bit different this is the place. ||September 20, 2018
nadineb439||40||Went with friends to grab lunch, lots of food stalls and plenty of yummy choices. Lines weren’t too long either at 12, but did get busier. Down side is there is few public places to sit, so unless you choose somewhere with its own seating you’ll probably have to stand and eat.||September 19, 2018
regflex||50||I love going to London there is so much history so much to see and do. Borough Market was our first stop of the day the smells around the market of fantastic and although is now more of a tourist place there are still some of the old stalls around. You can get great food and drink here make sure you have your lunch here while on the move and grab yourself a drink from one of the market stalls. It can be difficult to find a place to sit down to eat your sandwich or noodles or burger or fish or paella or mussels the list goes on take time to visit one of the many pubs around the market.||September 19, 2018
lightning92||50||It never ceases to amaze me the quantity, quality and variation there is in Borough Market, both in the market and eating departments. If you cant find something here that you like, I would be astonished, It's busy at lunch times so be prepared to queue. I would like to see more seating for people to use whilst eating but then again space is limited. If you are at all interested in food, a visit here is a must.||September 19, 2018
cozzie50||40||One of the better markets we have been to in Europe..The diversity and quality of the produce was excellent.||September 19, 2018
sammied3000||50||Loads of different types of foods, cheeses and wines. Great experience with lots of samples. Right next door to the London bridge train station.||September 18, 2018
38clayg||50||Borough Market has all the food options you could ever ask for. Everything just looks amazing and it’s incredibly difficult to choose just one thing. I went five times and still want to try to more. I definitely recommend stopping by for lunch some time during a trip to London, as Borough Market is the best there is.||September 18, 2018
Jim F||50||Borough Market is the next stop in London to stock our fridge after M&S to stock our fridge when we arrive in London.You can find just about anything in Borough Market. We usually start our tour with fish and chips at FISH Restaurant. Then it is off to the "stalls" to complete our shopping.The selections are varied, good, and reasonable, whether it be meats, vegetables, cheese, wine or even some souvenirs to take back.Borough Market is and experience and a London land mark.A must visit.||September 18, 2018
jackie_collett||50||Borough Market is a wonderful place, its buzzing & alive, one of my favourite places in LONDON, with some much choice, of the wonderful Fresh delicious Fruits, Pies, Fish & cheeses, you would be glad you went ! ||September 17, 2018
AntAus||20||I do not understand the travellers mantra of "go to the market to sample the local culture", I have visited many places, and this has never rung true - and the same goes for Borough Market!I went in with an open mind, genuinely curious to see what an "ole London Market" was really like.I got precicely zero taste of a real London Market. This market is heavily gentrified, and very much panders to the latest on trend foodie fashion. If you are coming for a real British Meat Pie - you will leave dissapointed. However if the whole reason saved up for years to fly into London for your trip of a lifetime was to sample "authentic" paella or real Greek Gyros - then I guess it was all worth while...||September 17, 2018
Michael L||40||We visited a couple of years ago at the same time of the year. It was popular then, but the crowds were manageable. You could walk through leisurely, sample some of the items and have a relaxing day. This time there were people pushing their way through almost aimlessly. We did enjoy it and would recommend experiencing the market, but it is no longer near the top of my “don’t miss” list. ||September 17, 2018
Artmo||40||A lovely little market selling a complete range of all types of food. A great place to browse and taste some of the free samples on offer.||September 17, 2018
ptrabant||40||So its a undercover market with lots of food options and some drink . Mostly for tourists rather than any locals and has developed this way for some years . But with trains rattling above , buy some food on a warm day and have a picnic on the south bank of the river thames .||September 16, 2018
Anne O||50||I was expecting wonderful things and Borough Market didn't disappoint. Lovely, friendly stall holders, samples galore and marvellous food. From sausages on sticks, confectionery, fresh fish, amazing fruit & veg through to unusual meats such as camel and some incredible cheeses. Not cheap but so worth it. I can't wait to go again-armed with a very big cool bag for my purchases. ||September 16, 2018
GarryF965||50||Went Saturday lunchtime and virtually ate for free, plenty of samples from lots of international foodstuff. ||September 16, 2018
788ellenm||40||I love Borough Market but I am often put off by all the tourists. We went yesterday and all the charm was still there. Definitely worth fighting the crowds for some yummy treats.||September 16, 2018
joeled0413||50||Always visit this when I go to London! Absolutely love the variety and quality of the food/drink/goods here. One of my favourite things about London :D||September 15, 2018
davidbG6404QW||50||As a ‘foody’ a great place to go. Fantastic choice of every food you can think of, and some you have never heard of!Plenty of stalls selling snacks, including scallops freshly cooked.Will always go there at the end of a visit to London in order to bring various items back.||September 15, 2018
GrishGrish||50||If you are a foodie, this place is not to be missed. Do not eat before you go. There are dozens of stalls selling loads of things to take home - cheese, olive oil, incredible fresh veggies, baked goods, spices - and stalls which sell food ready to eat. There is amazing coffee too as well as mulled wine or Pima cups, depending on the season. Surrounding the market are loads of wonderful restaurants, some with queues. It is also very festive around the holida6 season. Not to be missed. Oh, and Southwark Cathedral is next door.||September 15, 2018
Julia C||50||We had a great afternoon at the market - vendors are friendly and wonderful products. We bought some fresh breads, cheese and truffle oil all at reasonable prices. Lots of selection of everything and the vendors really know their stuff.||September 13, 2018
463jingweiz||50||Being to other market in London doesn't impress much. This one truly stands out because it's so much more affordable than others. London can be an expensive place for most foreigners especially a frugal one like me. I wasn't looking forward to shopping in London but this place is awesome. It's not like you will find "cheap" stuff here but instead you will find special thing. Stuff you will bring home and be proud of i.e Scotch. I probably saw the biggest pot of paelia in my life. I was stun by all the small shops mostly mom and pop. With a good warm apple cider in hand, you will be set to explore this place. I found a Scotch shop with a huge selection and mostly small distilleries. People in this place are nice. I had to admit I got lose from my guide after wondering off. They helped me to get to my meeting spot. In term of tourists, there are very little to speak of. Most people go here are locals and employee in the building surrounding. Getting here is a bit tricky because I didn't notice I was in the market after getting off the bridge. Keep an eye out and follow the map. Remember. Hot apple cider!!||September 12, 2018
Colin P||50||We visited here on Saturday 8th Sept and although it was not our first time, we are never failed to be impressed by the range of food on sale. Well worth a visit||September 12, 2018
esvajosh||50||we didn't and regret it. Although it would be difficult to choose what to eat because the choices are plenty. Great shops, tons of samples, great smells, great place to pick up a gift to take home. ||September 12, 2018
JR1707||40||Went there during lunch and is a huge market that sell so many many things and can be test before buying which is good||September 12, 2018
sean2shop||30||Walking around at weekends the market is obviously very busy with both locals and tourists. Do make sure you cover every aisle as there is a lot to see. Some of the food seemed fairly reasonable (well compared to London prices anyway). Very easy to get to from London Bridge tube station but it’s also only a short walk across the bridge to the city.Been there, seen it, done it...||September 12, 2018
shernellt||40||Although this area isn’t that big, it’s a place where people bring out their carts and umbrellas to sell local food. I got a really nice and healthy homemade bread here. Some stalls start to close up by 5:00 pm, so better get there a bit earlier. Just a two-minute walk from the London Bridge.||September 11, 2018
Wander18Lust||50||Amazing market with a huge variety of food. From fresh fruit to veggie burgers to homemade cheese, they have it all. Bought fruit, cheeses, yoghurts, pastries, granola and vegetables here. All delicious and high quality. ||September 11, 2018
PimD40||20||Lovely to see all this fresh food but when you see all the so called street food they are so over priced and not very appealing. On the other hand the fresh food stalls are brilliant there are 3 that I purchased food and they are cheese(French) from normandea Londres ,Italian cold meats , roasted aubergine and thinly sliced smoked pork cheek and the bread from Olivier just opposite normandea Londres ||September 11, 2018
Ninajtravels||50||A foodies dream, this market an eclectic array of food. Highly recommend spending some time here and definitely come on an empty stomach!! ||September 10, 2018
travelmomSanJose||50||We rode the bus over mid afternoon. This was WAY better than the reviews.... dozens of stands cooking crazy good food, a well stocked spice shop, fruit and veggie stands, several cheese shops. It was wonderful, and not tooooo expensive. ( I think we spent less than 20 pounds) ( If you like cheese, don’t miss the racklett! )||September 9, 2018
142arianep||50||I come here not to have a meal but to buy the finest produces to prepare it.Although pricey, here you can find finest fish, meat, wine and processed foods at the same plAce.Love it. ||September 8, 2018
TOURtheWORLDMexPal||50||- I visited this market (the oldest in London as advertised), and I loved it - Lunch: I highly recommend the following:- First the Paella it is the first food station/shop after you descend the stairs coming to the market from London bridge. - Second the Fish and Chip at the award winning establishment. At the next street- Third. The fresh juices and fruits - Fourth. The hot chocolate cafe. Just opposite the fish and chips place||September 8, 2018
gn95||50||The market was busy and bustling on Saturday. We ate roast porchetta rolls, oysters, deep fried squid, and sampled a wide range of cheeses, pate and other foods. There's plenty for everyone, an assault on the senses and great fun||September 8, 2018
allisonhX1347WJ||50||I could spend hours and thousands of dollars here. The variety of food never disappoints. The quality of food never disappoints. Usually go in the morning and eat until we can’t anymore. ||September 8, 2018
PJRibadeneira||50||I had read that this market is one of the recommended "attractions" for gourmet people in London so, we decided to take a walk around!Not fancy but unbelievable attractive and appealing food options. From oysters to indian food, from vegan options to giant fresh shrimps, from Spanish paella to german hot dogs.In summary, for us who love to eat, it's heaven on Earth.||September 8, 2018
linda87955||50||Interesting place, you can choose between different places to have a snack or something to eat. Just hope it's not raining !||September 7, 2018

ZachLee||40||Nice pork burgers at boston sausages, and mac and cheese pulled pork. Nice place to browse for local foodstuffs. Near attractions like the tower bridge. Worth a visit.||September 6, 2018
Narziss||40||This is market has a great selection of foods and eating places and if you're walking around the South Bank and looking for somewhere good for lunch, this is it!||September 5, 2018
Arctos101||50||I spent an entire afternoon here eating my way from stall to stall. Chatting to so many different people from around the world who have now settled here was wonderful. We all shared a love of food and more importantly wine! I was there alone so, don't be afraid to go solo. Everyone was so welcoming and I had so many hugs!My advice is to allow yourself time to relax here. I highly recommend the Oysters at Richard Haward and the salt beef sandwiches.If you are driving down to london, you may wish to bring a cool box with ice packs as the have packed fresh artisan pasta and exotic meats.||September 5, 2018
venicefish||50||Before retreating back to the suburbs after a fabulous weekend we had to dive in here on the route south, out of the city.The oldest food market in the city......when you arrive in the area the first thing you encounter are some of the oldest historic buildings in London.The smells of all that wonderful food hits you(emmmm)and then there is a cacophony of noise that is simple to explain......people selling and consuming all manner of different culinary delights! The standards are high as the sellers take their food seriously! Most of the traders I was informed years ago produce their own fayre.......a testament to the philosophy and standards this wonderful food market demands.We keep coming back because it is one of the remarkable places that makes London probably the greatest city on the planet(yes I am bias fellas),A thousand years old and still the best..............ask any Londoner as a tourist where to go and Borough Market will be there and near the very top!Enjoy..............||September 5, 2018
IzzyBella17||50||A treat for the senses. I would be here most days if I lived locally. Beautifully fresh produce, fruit, veg, sweets, truffle, olives/oil, freshly baked bread, pastries both sweet and savory. Good coffee and Pimms||September 5, 2018
javan743||50||We visited on a Saturday for lunch and it was incredibly crowded. I think it added to the fun but if you are looking for a more leisurely stroll with less of a ‘packed in like sardines’ feel go during some off peak time. Food offerings sampled by our group were all wonderful including paella, fish and chips, meat pies, and Asian food. Standing room only for eating which was okay by me but not so appreciated by some in our group. Stalls had lots of interesting food and non food items that would make for great gifts. If I could have brought some of the local cheeses back with me, I would have! ||September 3, 2018
hanesmd||50||Little of this...little of that. We enjoyed the diverse food selection. Plus the classes are wonderful. ||September 3, 2018
J0_Glen||50||My wife and I were first time visitors to the Borough Market and we at not accustomed to this setup in Southern California, but it was fascinating. No clothes for sale but every kind of found product you can imagine and samples for many of the cheeses, oils, breads and other items. A very interesting time. We went on a Saturday and it was very crowded but fun even though maneuvering through the crowd did take some effort.||September 3, 2018
Joasi23||50||Great atmosphere, the location is impressive, historic yet bordering the glamourous new architecture around that area. There is a vast array of different food and drink on offer and free samples on most stalls to take away the guesswork of which to buy. We loved it, but on a sunny Saturday it was quite a challenge to cope with the crowds.||September 2, 2018
karencW4922VE||50||Walking through Borough Market is an experience not to be missed. The variety of food stuffs should be of interest to anyone venturing into the market. As you can see, my interest was cheese. The great part was that each vendor let you sample their cheeses so when you made a purchase, you knew exactly what you were getting. They even vacuumed packed cheeses so you could take them home with you! It is a fun way to spend some time in London and sample interesting food at the same time!||September 2, 2018
cobbo41||50||Visited when down for the weekend for my daughters 18th. Group of 11 of us and not one was disappointed with what they tried. You can try lots different foods from around the world and there are several great pubs on the outside to rest in between courses!!! The hustle and bustle of the stalls make it a great atmosphere and much prefer this to a sit down lunch.||September 2, 2018
1964patty||40||Traditional market full of food, drink and other stalls, only problem, it was a rainy Saturday afternoon and it felt like most of London was there as it was very busy, but that adds to the atmosphere, but felt like a pickpockets paradise||September 2, 2018
kaj2600||50||The borough market should not be missed. It's delightful. The food stalls, produce, fish and meat are amazing! Make sure you're hungry! The market has everything from prepared street food and British favorites, for take away or eating there-- to fresh meat, fish, cheese, baked goods and produce.Bridget Jones and Harry Potter were both filmed in the area. The Bridget Jones flat is between the two parts of the market- just as u cross the street between the two in the Globe Tavern building.||September 1, 2018
markquixotic||40||It is a grand London experience, exploring all the nooks and crannies of the market. And it is a culinary cornucopia, with every kind of food imaginable, from artisan cheeses to raw oysters, Melton Mowbray Pork Pies to craft beers and ciders. Buy from an endless assortment of vendors and find a corner in which to eat it, or splurge and enjoy one of the many restaurants and watch an extraordinary cross section of humanity pass by.If you're on a diet, don't even think about it. Otherwise, tuck in, as the Brits say. It is an experience for all your senses, and a people watcher's dream.||September 1, 2018
Michael E||40||Often walked along the embankment but never realised how close Borough Market wasTo the Tate and the Golden Hind. Masses of food stalls serving a wide variety of foods from Thai to Baltic. Delicious desserts, cakes and savouries. Great atmosphere and loads of vegetarian and vegan. Heaven. Make sure you walk round the stalls before you choose. Veggie Thali was v good and filling coupled with a couple of Bhajis. Loads and loads of delicious options in the setting of an old market which has retained many original features and signs. One downside is the lack of seating. Surely this can be addressed and still keep the character of the market. A must visit if you are in the area.||September 1, 2018
KevinR2147||50||I could easily see myself come here every week if I lived in London. Great food stalls with dishes from around the world. Options for vegetarians and vegans too. ||September 1, 2018

Nickh1969||50||Must put on your list , just a great vibe and fantastic food displays , simply just go n see it , loved it .||August 30, 2018
Noralí N||40||Wonderful place! There are so many different dishes to try, if you like trying new things, you should definitely go... The only thing we didn't like was that there are not so many sitting areas, and in the sitting area there are only a few tables so you'll probably have to eat while standing up.||August 29, 2018
828cerysj||50||Love Borough market. We visited on a Tuesday and it wasn’t crowded at all. The smells and sounds are wonderful. We had an amazing salt beef sandwich. There is plenty of choice for everyone and an amazing herbs and spices stall called spice mountain. You can’t visit London and not go to Borough Market. The underground is literally minutes away. ||August 29, 2018
matthewmcdowell||50||Stumbled along this place whilst walking around London. The amount of food stalls on offer is amazing. Every cuisine you can think of. Got a little busy in there at lunch time but a thoroughly enjoyable experience.||August 29, 2018
Linda T||50||Would love to have spent longer here. Loads of fantastic produce. Loads to see and a great atmosphere. It gets very busy but it is worth working through the crowds for the lovely goods on sale. Enjoyed fresh oysters at one of the stalls. There is so much choice it definitely deserves another visit. We will be going back. If you want a great experience go here. Highly recommend.||August 29, 2018
Eva Julia T||40||This place has the most delicious selections of breads, cheeses and fruits among many other choices of foods. The stalls are well spaced. you can enjoy looking around before selecting where to buy. It is wonderful for dress coffee beans, too. We have enjoyed the "street food" there as well as delightful restaurants an coffee places.||August 28, 2018
leov708||50||All the quality food you can imagine, from homemade bread, pies and cakes to chutney, sausages, oysters, truffles, you name it. Go!||August 28, 2018
riversideSue||50||Bustling noisy fun, and you can buy ingredients for a tasty fresh meal or just sit and people-watch with a top end coffee or choose an excellent meal with the freshest foods. Good quality produce and wide range of common and unusual fruit veg fish and meat. Not such fun for children as gets crowded and is near busy roads. Go solo or with friends...or a date.||August 27, 2018
rhianrli||50||We were walking through this great place and there was some absolutely tantalizing food stalls. How could we NOT sample them? We went for some sweet treats which gave me a huge sugar rush, I've gotta admit. Overall, I've gotta recommend it to anybody who loves food or for anybody who's feeling even a tad bit hungry - trust me, you won't be able to resist those smells.||August 27, 2018
Russ K||40||"Has it been here long?". "Gosh, we have a farmers market that opened in 1947 back home". Nice try but no cigar. Borough Market has stood on this spot for about a thousand years. Yup, 1000. Oddly enough, it has changed a bit since then. The main alteration is that once, and until relatively recently, this was a market where locals would go to buy their essential shopping. Not now. The market attracts tourists from all over the globe drawn to its dazzling array of produce and very convivial atmosphere. Are the goods good - yes, indeed they are. Are they expensive - oh boy, are they ever. Go and enjoy, wander around, marvel at the organic this, that & the other, eat whatever takes your fancy (it's all delicious) but do not, for an instant, think that you are paying good old 'market prices' - you're not. It's over the odds, but you're having fun. It can get very crowded so if you're taking little kids, hold onto them tight. It's really easy to get lost in the crowd. I like this place a lot, it cheers you up, always amuses and despite my better judgement, I always come away with at least one over-priced item of food that I demolish the moment I get home.||August 27, 2018
IanWD||40||If you love your food and love cooking then this is a must visit location. This was our second visit to the market and we enjoyed it as much this time as the first. We'll definitely be back and would recommend you give it a go. ||August 27, 2018
Girlwiththegoldengun||40||Despite living in London for several decades, this was my first visit. it was smaller than I had expected, but the choice and variety of food on offer was amazing! There was artisanal food to buy which all looked delicious (don't expect it to be cheap though!) and street food to eat there and then. I had a very tasty pad thai for about £6 - yum! They also took credit cards, which was useful - a cashpoint in the market would be useful. I will definitely go back next time I am near London Bridge.||August 27, 2018
Eloygm||50||If you find yourself in London, you must come to this fantastic market. Great cheese selection and an awesome place to have a quick bite!||August 27, 2018
garethh887||50||On a bimble down the South Bank we came to the market for lunch - it was my partner’s birthday - and got some excellent salt and pepper squid and a glass of wine. Enjoyed an hour smelling all the fabulous ingredients and listening to the stall holders calling. We’ll be back! ||August 27, 2018
8Georgina||50||Went for some food and ended up trying the Ethiopian stand followed by some chocolate eclairs. Absolutely incredible food and great value for food quality. Bit awkward to eat standing up but overall enjoyable. ||August 27, 2018
samgraham1||50||I love this place. It seems to marry the vibrant buzz of a busy market with a kind of relaxed atmosphere, where your free to do what you like when you like. An eclectic mixture of retail outlets from spices to trinkets to fresh produce to fabrics...the list goes on. The food available is both wide in choices and brilliant in quality. Grab a pint or a glass of wine and watch the world go by.....like any busy place, just be careful with your phone and stuff- the popularity of this place, both for returning locals and tourists alike, attracts some professional pick pockets, but you’d be very unlucky to come across them. I’ve lived in London since 1985 and this is one of my favourite go to places! Enjoy||August 27, 2018

RazzyBthefirst||50||We've visited here many times and sampled some great food. On this occasion we hadn't long since eaten breakfast and this was probably a mistake in hindsight. Firstly it was midday on a Saturday, not a good day for browsing. Also, there was a mass of people who like to eat and walk so first you have to see them eat and second they congest the market.So top tip, go when it's quiet, not open on Sundays and make sure you'e hungry - it's so much more enjoyable.||August 27, 2018
PensterA64||50||Lots of yummy things to sample and eat or take home for later. Loved the location under the railway line, close to London Bridge. Take the underground to London Bridge station and follow the signs to the markets.||August 26, 2018
Oskar-Brooklyn||50||Markets stalls with exotic cheeses, fine cuts of meat, fish mongers, wine, beer, vegetables. Exotic and commonplace stalls. Literally any food stuff ingredient you can imagine all fresh and well presented. Like being inside a Thanksgiving cornucopiaThe food stalls are even more fantastic. Smells from all over the globe. My daughter and I found the pad Thai stand and the shrimp and chicken version were ambrosia. You can get lost on this little slice of heaven but it is time we’ll spent.  Certainly more enjoyable in harvest months than early spring - but what isn’t? ||August 26, 2018
824PeterH||20||I would have loved to have a look around this place but unfortunately other than the street food vendors and one restaurant it was closed. Should have checked but never mind, shame really as we were only in London for a day!||August 26, 2018
geotech522||50||It was surprising to us to discover the Borough Market just a short distance from our hotel (Hilton London Tower Bridge). It's literally in the shadow of The Shard on the southbank of the Thames near the London Bridge, under the railroad bridges, and adjacent to the Southwark Cathedral. It is a wonderful wholesale and retail market that dates back to the 12th Century or even earlier. It is believed to be possibly the oldest market of its kind in London. It is a great place to find street food of virtually every type and at very reasonable prices. It is also like a farmer's market where you will find fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, fish and other food products. Open 6 days a week, it is an exciting place to discover wonderful foods and enjoy a vibrancy that is hard to describe but there is a real following of the locals here. Yet it is also one for the visitor to enjoy some real local action. Not stuffy like other landmarks in London and definitely worthwhile to visit for a good meal and good time.||August 25, 2018
leerossi8082||50||Came here based on a recommendation from a server in a restaurant. Great range of street food, definitely will find something to please everyone! Glad I received the recommendation so just passing it on! Give it a try||August 25, 2018
GoOutInstead||50||Interesting food stalls, amazing venue for watching people. The standard of food quality is excellent. Assorted salami, amazing cheese assortment, excellent vegetables. The food stalls seizing huge oysters is beyond and oyster lovers dream. The huge curries good also. Nice Spanish store. Good restaurants. Can get super busy but worth the visit.||August 25, 2018
Carol D||50||We always stay in this area when staying in london, love the market at night loads of different food and drinks yo try. They are lots of local fair to try and buy, brilliant atmosphere recommend highly.||August 24, 2018
Peter B||50||A sensory overload !!! Fresh fruit and veg, artisan food stalls selling everything from pickled eel, to the best onion bhaji and you cant say no to the myriad of cakes and pastries tempting you... A must visit if you are in London!!!||August 23, 2018
Beth K||50||Visited Borough Market several times during our week long visit. It is a must see when visiting. We bought bread, delicious granola, fruit, jam and chocolates. They also had restaurants and bakeries. ||August 23, 2018
foreverhungry90||50||Borough market is a must visit in London as it is frequented by Londoners for the amazing food surrounded by lively pubs. Although it is over run with tourists it is still an absolute pleasure to visit. Watching all kinds of food being ordered, served and eaten, it is a hub for flavour. As you enter the market you are immediately intrigued by the huge pans of paella, towering burgers, and the sizzling sound of grilled meats. It is hard not to stop at the first vender and finish the day there, but you must fight the urge and wonder around the market trying and tasting all that the market has to offer. It is the perfect place to sip a glass of prosecco while tasting every kind of cheese you can imagine, ordering a bowl full of the best dumplings, and share a portion of oysters as they are chucked to order. This market defines the heart of London through flavour and diversity. l don't visit nearly as much as I would like to, but I know I will be back.||August 23, 2018
Johntour||40||The recent London Bridge tragedy, in which a van mowed down several victims, affected Borough Market, which lost a lot of trade, but such is the resilience of the vendors that the Market is up and running and thriving.Situated near London Bridge Rail and Tube (Jubilee and Northern Line (Bank Branch)), it is a great place to sample some organic and hand-made wares in a mini-market of excellence, with people who certainly know their cheese and wine.It's a place to partake as part of a walking tour and London Bridge itself is a stone's throw away.||August 22, 2018
ThisMamasMiles||50||So. Many. Options. The Borough Market is a food lovers paradise! You can get anything from Asian noodle stir-fry, to meat pies and mashed potatoes, to the most delicious desserts. So many pastries to indulge in...they are fancy and beautiful to look at. And king-sized chocolate chip cookies that are second to none. This is a great place to visit and meander around the stalls looking for your next yummy bite.||August 22, 2018
HanandElla||40||We found this little gem because we took the wrong turn out of the tube amazing array of smells we didn't know what to eat everything looked fresh the free samples were lovely and made just buy things we wouldn't have.||August 21, 2018
AlgarveSunman||50||everything, food, drink, market stalls, restaurants, bars; Borough Market is a must do, don't miss it.||August 21, 2018
philo-backpack||50||The atmosphere is relaxed, the food is diversified, there is plenty to taste. I suggest doughnouts from the bakery school, the best we ever had!!||August 21, 2018
Nidgehammer||50||I worked at London Bridge 30 years ago when all you could get at Borough Market was fruit and veg, I don’t know who’s idea it was to grow and nurture it but it’s a booming area now chock-a-block with tourists and locals alike. The market itself offers so many different food options from cheeses to meats, burgers to Croatian food and curry to French food. You can still get your fruit and vegetables there - high quality at that, but there’s so much more. So successful has the market become that there are wonderful restaurants and bars stretching all around the market and beyond. Right next to Southwark Cathedral, not to be missed.||August 20, 2018
tufttufttuft||50||Came into London for the day and had heard good things about Borough Market. We have two chicken who are what intolerant, and one of them is also dairy free and after a bit of research we learnt that they could eat here. Very happy with what we found, all food stalls are well labelled so we could make a decision. Everyone chose different foods and we also had some of the goats milk ice cream (with a gf cone!!). Well worth walking round and we will happily go back again soon. ||August 20, 2018
emmar815||30||We wandered around here as our first place to see in London it wasn't very far from our hotel.It's definitley like in the tv but it's very over priced and 80% if the stall holders we tried to talk to were rude we wanted to try and discuss their products but they weren't interested.Good experience wouldn't go back ||August 20, 2018
638erikm||40||This was a wonderful surprise. Our mistake was that we had a big breakfast so we were not in the mood to really try stuff but everything looked good and the place had a fun vibe. It gets swamped around lunchtime. The fudge is really good!!||August 20, 2018
floors141||50||I really liked it here. It's nice to walk around, and try different kind of food. The ambiance is awesome. And you can see a lot of stalls! Next time in London, I would definately go here again.||August 20, 2018
Andrew D||50||You really can’t beat a good market, and Borough Market is definitely one of my favourite places in London. After a walk about all the amazing food stalls, eating as much as I could, I called in to coffee heaven, also know as Monmouth Coffee. We got some amazing coffee, and sat outside on the footpath, and just watched the hustle and bustle of this wonderful place. It’s a must experience.||August 19, 2018
Q7964JVtomp||40||Love coming to Borough Market when I come to London. The quality (and prices!) of the produce is by and large stunning! Also, the local bar and restaurant scene is awesome…||August 19, 2018
Coast2Capital||50||I love Borough Market every time I visit. It can get incredibly busy, but it’s well worth persevering with the crowds. I could spend a fortune in here at the various different stalls. Choose a stall to buy lunch then take it out of the market and perch on a wall or kerb to eat in the street or head to the riverside. Stock up on unusual treats and ingredients to take home. Just look after your belongings and keep your bags, wallets etc safe, as with any crowded place.||August 19, 2018
Diana P||50||For sure a place to visit while you are in London. The market offers diversity, so much to see, to taste, to try and of course to buy. Super busy place, but yeah you are in a big city. enjoy the atmosphere to the fullest and open your eyes and take your time to observe everything. ||August 19, 2018
RainSeattleMom||50||I would like to dock a star because of a lack of seating for people who buy food from stands, but I can't because I loved it too much! We walked here via the Tower Bridge after a morning London Tower visit on a Thursday in August. It was a perfect place to find lunch because there are great food booths and many vegetarian options. My daughter and I wandered around looking at all the fun things, soaking up the culture. It is better than our Seattle Pike Place! We had a fresh berry snack, and bought some Turkish Delight to eat in a nearby park. If we were going back to the flat afterwards, we would have gotten fixings for dinner. We walked to the Globe after our lunch visit. It was one of our favorite places in London!||August 19, 2018
Camille7658||40||Borough market, Saturday morning 9am, perfect time to visit. Crowds have not yet formed so you can wander at leisure. Lots of fresh food stalls, speciality breads, cheese's, vegetables, meats. Something for everyone.You can buy hot food while you browse. It isn't the cheapest market you will visit, but even if you dont buy, it is well worth a visit for all the sights and smells.||August 19, 2018
jennschneider79||50||This is a must visit while in London! We loved the fresh fruit and juice. We had breakfast here and it was delicious! We loved walking through the market and sampling the different types of food. ||August 18, 2018
LondonGenie||30||I'm a Londoner but have just returned from 10 years away and today was the first time I visited this market. It was very crowded, queues for food were quite long. There were few quiet places to stand, never mind sit and eat. The lay-out also seems pretty random, so it's hard to know where you are, or re-trace your steps to something that looked nice you saw before. Things are expensive. My wife had a Thai 'aromatic duck wrap with plum sauce', about GBP8.50, nice, pretty meaty, but expensive. I had a hot Scotch egg (nice but a touch salty for me) and sweet potato fries from a stall called Scotchtails. GBP6.90. If you're used to crowds and jostling etc then you might be fine here. It was a bit claustrophobic here for me this Saturday, and I reckon it might we way more chilled out, and spacious on a week-day. So that's the plan for a future visit, when we hope to have a chance to exhale, relax, and really have a chance to wonder slowly and get a better grip on what is what at this venue.ps. There was a fancy looking drinks shop/stall here - but the prices!!? A bottle of Westmalle Trappist beer, circa GBP2.20/30 at 'posh' Waitrose supermarket, was £3.80 here. Shame, they've a large range of interesting drinks, but the mark-ups!||August 18, 2018
154RSH||50||A must ess place for everyone especially for all lovers of varied and tasty food. It was a great day.||August 18, 2018
K6662BHjasonr||50||My teenage daughter loved this place. All kinds of food, desserts, and more. Very cool ambiance. Definite must see||August 18, 2018
foxylady93||50||What a buzzing place, so much to look at, loads of tasting to be done, from food to drink, lots of activity ,was very hot day on visiting might be better next time on a cooler day||August 16, 2018
Robvillan||50||Cracking market with a great atmosphere.Had to walk round the stalls 3 times as there was so much good looking and smelling food to choose from!Eventually went for Ethiopian and it was amazing! I’d have been impressed with the food if it had been at a quality restaurant - it was that good.Will definitely go again.||August 16, 2018
optimus07||40||Similar to La Boqueria in Barcelona, this is mostly a food market where you can eat or shop. Fruits & Vegetables are all over around, ham, cheese, chicken and nice discoveries. Even if it is touristic you can still walk around and enjoy some juices or sandwiches or nice discoveries (like Cylan Tea)||August 16, 2018
Spartacus2000||50||A place all foodies must visit. A piece of advice, it can be quite crowded (I visited on a Saturday) so be prepared. Don't let the crowd put you off, the food is great. Another warning, the variety of food is pretty astounding and can be a bit overwhelming but that's only more reason to come back. I went with the pies - the steak and kidney pie was really good. Wish the market would have more sitting room, it's a little difficult to eat there if you don't get a spot.The other upside of the market is that it is located close to Southbank. You can always take your food there and eat by the water.||August 15, 2018
Motwoosotdot||50||We only had time for a quick walk around but loved the atmosphere, the variety on offer & the prices were reasonable. We will be back on our next trip!||August 15, 2018
Jwren77||50||If you are a foodie it’s your place to go. Great vibe so much to try and see. Too much choice when hungry!! If I lived closer I definitely would of spent a fortune!! ||August 15, 2018
michelle111973||30||I was a bit disappointed tbh, what was there was good! But half of it was shut.Not much atmosphere and all the stalls were similar.Not what I was expecting it to be.||August 14, 2018
georged263||40||Even though all of the permanent stalls weren't open at the time I went (Monday afternoon), it was still definitely worth the visit! I was pleased to find the non-permanent stalls through the back of the market where there were umbrellas and so many food stalls, from every cuisine you could possibly think of! Was delicious and a great array of things to try!Was surprised to find that there weren't great facilities though- there was significant lack of seating (especially since sitting on the ground was out of the question due to the rain) and there were only two female bathrooms!! But all in all, great for a local food market! Fresh, delicious, local food, which hit the spot!||August 13, 2018
Nielsjespersen||40||Risk of overeating or overbuying. A lot of fresh, innovative and interesting foods and drinks. We enjoyed the pies from Pieminister.||August 13, 2018
isabelleclare013||40||A square filled with a diverse range of food and craft stalls which cater for people of all tastes and dietary needs. Perfect for vegan treats! ||August 12, 2018
J C||50||Quite possibly one of my favourite outdoor covered markets Located a few metres away from London Bridge station. Give yourself enough time to browse and eat. Bring plenty of cash.||August 12, 2018
UrbanMonkey48||50||You will not go hungry here. Totally open air market with literally hundreds of food vendors, offering every type of cuisine one could imagine, being cooked fresh continuously. As well as order and eat, there are fresh meat vendors, fresh fish and seafood, cheese, bread, pastrries, spices, produce....if it relates to food, it is there. It is a bit overwhelming. It could take you an hour to even decide WHAT to eat! The lines at the food cendors get ezcessively long at meal tmes.||August 12, 2018
annamC4770NI||40||This market just around the corner of London bridge is very busy but rich of tastes. You will find here cosy café, ethnic restaurant, Italian stands, flowers and fruit and vegetarian choices, between the narrow alleys of the old London,This place has been a set for Herry Potter and Sherlock apparently. A bit expensive for a market but is the Heart of London and the food is generally very good so you won't mind.||August 12, 2018
stacyd312||50||Borough market which is a stones throw from London Bridge and the Thames is food heaven! The aroma of dishes from all around the world are just amazing and the array of food stalls are so tempting to the taste buds ! We ate fish and chips as it had rained all day and this to me is the best rainy day food . I tried the paella the next day alongside a glass of sangria which was delish . Not cheap here but well worth the money ! The atmosphere is infectious - I will definitely visit again ! Prices range from 3- 10 pounds . Average price is aprox 8 pounds for a good portion of tasty food . ||August 12, 2018
tezelasena||30||The food looked decent but I was expecting more like Camden market. Wasn't worth the hour I spent to get there. Prices were ridiculous too. Definitely overrated.||August 12, 2018
HS2012UK||40||A buzz of excitement here. Loads of market stalls but lovely place to eat and drink too. Really enjoyed it and would go back. ||August 11, 2018

johnP118||50||Darn good thing this market is not close to my house. My wife would disown me. Great variety of fresh fruits, and veggies, and great ethic foods, and sausages, and cheeses, and oysters, and fresh breads, and pastries, and beer and wine, and olive oils, and pubs and wine bars and paella, and tapas, and........l Atmosphere abounds. Under tracks, but huge. Would visit here again before I went back to 99 percent of the more touristy places.||August 11, 2018
EleriRumsey||40||Great for a visit..........loads of great food to chose from. It gets VERY busy, but just what you’d expect. I like the fact that there’s lots of water stations there so you can fill your water bottles up, great in the recent heatwave we’ve experienced.||August 11, 2018
Bluebellplasnewydd||40||This is a fun place although you will not see many Londoners doing their shopping here. There are plenty of street food stalls all looking and smelling great. Unfortunately there are few places to sit and eat your food but at least you are mostly under cover. Vegetable and speciality foreign food stalls also abound but the prices are high. A great place to wander and linger. In the evening it is full of locals and tourists drinking and enjoying themselves. One of the best markets in London even if not particularly genuine.||August 11, 2018
484patm||50||Spent a great afternoon at the Borough Market. We were one of the last ones to get a table at Padilla restaurant before they closed down for the afternoon great. Great meal! Then walked around and bought some curry powder at Spice Mountain. Have since used it at home and it is SO much better than the stuff we have been buying at the grocery store.||August 11, 2018
KaiserFerris||50||The range of food they have here is fantastic, with everything from empanadas to sushi, as well as stalls selling a huge range of fresh ingredients.It’s probably best to visit around lunch time so that you have a big enough appetite to sample a few different stalls.||August 11, 2018
Jos L||50||Whether you want to go for a walk or eat something or just absorb the atmosphere, borough market has it all.A variety of food stalls give you a wide range to choose from. Or maybe you want nice bread, cheese,....It's always on my schedule.||August 10, 2018
Della025||50||Borough market has been operated since 1700's, the market is famous with its local tenant who makes fresh and delicious products such as jam, smoke beef, sourdough! and all kind of variant of food you could imagine! don't forget the cheese!Not only tasty Britain munchies, you can also find many Asian Cuisines from Thailand, India, Turks and more. I had padthai, fresh juice and Turkish delight for lunch, and oh an ice cream which made using India technique. The padthai was my favorite, the mix of sweet and savor alongside with the bitter taste from squeezed lemon, should have it more when I'm back in London! There's also a famous fish and chips which apparently won the best title of fish and chips in London. You should come and see for yourself, take your time to stroll and buy all the food! Buy one portion and share with your friends, hence you will have more room for all the food tasting!||August 9, 2018
Jason G||50||We came here for lunch between Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London, and it worked out pretty well timing-wise (and it's kinda sorta between the 2 sites). Even though we knew we were seeking out Bread Ahead's highly coveted donuts (we found them--tasty!), we ended nibbling on a bunch of of other stuff as well. Allow yourself a bit of time to enjoy the feast for the senses here.||August 9, 2018
Road-Maven||50||Make a point to visit Borough Market when you're in London. It's a short walk from the London Bridge. We sampled our way through. Unfortunately, much of the food we wanted to buy wasn't suitable for travel (or would be confiscated when we came back to the US). Also, arrive hungry.||August 9, 2018
Christy M||50||If you decide to go definitely do not eat. The variety of different produce and food that is on offer is amazing. Will defenetly be going back||August 8, 2018
910johnnyw||40||Great selection of foods on offer, easily accessible, vibrant and busy too. Will happily visit again ||August 8, 2018
ACJai||30||I expected it to be bigger but it was rather small and more touristy. I know a lot of the reviews talks about locals but i only saw tourists. Food selection was adequate but by no means great. Couple of Spanish places, but we were going to Madrid so that was out of our selection list. Enjoyed the coffee at Manmoouth Coffee.||August 7, 2018
tashaabond||50||Family trip to London we were told to visit here by friends! And wow the amount of different varieties of food were amazing! Something for everyone! ||August 7, 2018
kwc98||40||Certainly a popular choice. Plenty of vegetarian options, but it can be hard to even see all of the vendors with so many people there. Also plan on standing up and eating, there are very few tables and many eaters, so stand and more or less enjoy.||August 7, 2018
cocopotisawus||50||had some of my american cousins over on a .short visit and wanting to see London visited all the usual sites ,I decided to introduce them to the other half of LONDON and BOROUGH MARKET, well what a success they could not believe their eyes . ,cheese, meat,fish. oils and more,the wine . Yes there is so much to see in london, but the market gave them a true picture of our capital city||August 7, 2018
MrsHarris3||50||If you enjoy going to the big food markets like La Bouqueria in Barcelona or Mercado de Abastos in Oaxaca, then you will love a visit to Borough Market. The prices are fairly high, but the quality of much of the food is excellent and the spectacle of the place is certainly worth the visit. All the stalls are open on Friday and Saturday, the main market days, but there are some permanent stalls during the rest of the week.If you're in London staying at an apartment or house (VRBO, HomeAway or Airbnb type accommodation) then I recommend paying a visit on a Friday (it will be less busy than Saturday) to stock up on lots of lovely fresh organic produce, artisan breads, etc. It's not an early morning market - arriving at 9 is perfectly reasonable and things won't get busy until after 10am usually, even on a Saturday.If you are staying at a hotel and can't do any food shopping, then arrive around 11.45 for an early lunch (stuff will get very busy, even on a Friday) and visit one of the hot food stands for lunch. You can even get a glass of prosecco or champagne (or spiced mulled wine in the winter) and walk around, sampling bits of comte cheese, speck, etc. I'm vegan and there are lots of vegan options too - fantastic juice bars, a couple bakeries which do great vegan cake options, and V Burger which does a gorgeous range of vegan burgers.There are plenty of nice souvenirs to buy too, some artisan wares and jellies, jams, chutneys, packaged cheeses, etc which you can take home with you too.Unless you are just not a foodie person at all, then set aside an hour or so to visit this gorgeous market. It's just on the south side of London Bridge and it has good signage.||August 6, 2018
Jan N||50||This is a fascinating food market selling a massive range of produce from China teas, chocolate, fruit and vegetables I’ve never heard of and shots of healthy green stuff. There’s plenty more of course. The range is immense and among this there are stalls with organic, fresh farmed produce. Plenty to eat and drink in the different cafes and bars||August 6, 2018

Lochclose||50||This is a great market full of interesting items wonderful food you can spend hours wandering about then sit and have a meal .then if you feel up to it Southall Cathedral is just a few metres away beautiful well worth a visit||August 6, 2018

Smells of fresh food cooking was amazing actually wished we hadn't had lunch before. Lots of choices of hot, cold, snacks, drinks available. Great to visit ||August 6, 2018
MaltaBound||40||We went here in order to find something to eat and to wander around. There are many produce and other stores, but it felt like a tourist trap...pricey. Lots of take-out food at dine-in prices. Still, it was a nice place to wander around. There were a few regular priced take-out places. ||August 6, 2018
Mark F||50||Not to be missed busy market with loads of independent food choices. Great value amazing tastes. Love this place unfortunately nothing compares in Ireland to this ! Will be back every time I’m in London if I can. ||August 6, 2018

WelshLorna||40||Brilliant market and a lot to see. The merchandise is original but not cheap.Lots of places to eat and drink both in the market and near by.Well worth a visit. It is extremely busy.||August 5, 2018
j1lloyd||50||Borough Market was highly recommended & wasn't a let down. The market itself contains an amazing mixture of food to eat on the go, from Ethiopian stews, frankfurters & Asian noodles to salt beef sandwiches & squid paellas, as well as food to take away & eat at home. The smell of breads, meats, cheeses fill the air & come from far & wide. The fish selection is also significant. Outside of the market there are almost as many bars & restaurants all worth a look in for something more formal. My recommendation would be to go before 1pm before it gets too busy & go hungry. Take your big purse though, the goods are not cheap! ||August 4, 2018
John_SBiggleswade||40||A huge range of food and produce stalls on offer, with easy access from London Bridge station. We arrived in the early afternoon on a Saturday after visiting the nearby Shard and it was heaving. Probably best to get there earlier in the day, but if you don’t mind crowds the atmosphere was really buzzing.||August 4, 2018
ZahidMalti||50||Borough Market is fabulous for Foodies. Great atmosphere. Wonderful food. Passionate producers and sellers. Lot s of eating options at all price levels. Eclectic regular client base. Excellent location for easy access to Market and progressively more interesting surrounding area.Worth visiting multiple times for anyone who likes food.||August 4, 2018
392hesterw||50||Today was our second visit and it being a Saturday afternoon it was very, very busy. However, we were able to sit down at Brood. And able to find everyone in the group something they really liked. Including food and drinks from Brood (or they won’t allow you take a seat with them). Staff were friendly and helpful at all the stalls we visited. Atmosphere on the whole is relaxed. ||August 4, 2018
Jane P||50||What a wonderful place for amazing foodstuffs. You can buy the ingredients and then enjoy a mid-shopping snack before going home to cook. Sadly I don't live locally as I'd be here every week. Great place to visit even as a tourist as there is a great vibe.||August 4, 2018
326ETa||40||Walked through this market while doing a Harry Potter waking tour... a two-fer! These is something for everyone and unique to London, British items. Pimms, seafood, baked goods, teas, etc... The plus is that it’s near the river, which boasts a glorious view and it’s close to other attractions like, pubs and restaurants,Shakespeare’s Globe theatre, and yes... Harry Potter film locations! This is a must see, sample and walk through while in London.||August 3, 2018
Tom K||40||This local market has many food stalls for everything you would need for home and for dining out at lunch. We were there at lunch time and it was filled with not only the tourists but also the locals. We wandered through the entire market several times to check out the variety and the atractiveness of the food items. Saw people buying fruits, vegetables and meat for home. Great nationality options of food.||August 3, 2018
MrGee1234||40||On 3rd June 2017 this infamous market was subject to a vicious terrorist attack which resulted in the deaths of 8 people and 50 injured.The market traders stood together in solidarity and united and now this market is back open again and even better than ever before.I was proud to return to Borough Market as this place has soul, it has guts its got great atmosphere, its back to been extreamly busy.There is always music playing, lots of outdoor eateries, lots of stalls selling anything from fresh Fish to fresh Bread, lots of stalls preparing fast food from European, American and British but not forgetting Asian, Korean,Caribbean and Middle Eastern cruisean getting cooked in front of your very eyed and the authentic smells in the air make you feel so hungry.There is lots of souvenirs and typical london clothes to buy from the market to take home I would thoroughly recommend visiting this market which is already world famous and experience it for yourself the terrific atmosphere and see what lovely friendly people work here day in day out. The only critique I have is that it lacks much seating areas and the food from the stands is slightly on the higher side for what you get but then it's London and also you are experiencing Borough Market at its very best.||August 3, 2018
603narelleb||50||Great selections, many tasters available. Purchased yummy goodies for a platter lunch including pates, cheeses, meats, anchovies, olives and gourmet bread. All delicious.||August 3, 2018
johnkenn2018||50||Borough Market is by far one of the oldest and best markets in London, every time i go there love exploring different flavours of street food markets, salted beef sandwich and paella are my favorites there is always an amazing new dish to try ||August 3, 2018
Aurelie1686||50||We came here just to have a look, ended up having lunch there! it is crowded but it is easy to walk around and see all the varieties available there. I wish I had a market like this in my city.||August 3, 2018
almond6||40||Very nice market for a bite to eat. There’s so much food, cooked fresh and it smells amazing. It’s quite cramped but you can pick up fresh fruit and veg, bak d goods and such without too much hassle. The hot food on offer varies greatly so there’s something to suit everyone. It’s in a great location, right by London bridge on the Southbank, so is on your way to many a tourist attraction.||August 3, 2018
Amortimer67||50||We visited on a Saturday lunchtime, it was packed with people but was a fabulous atmosphere. The range of ready to eat food was amazing as well as the eccentric shops and stalls where you could buy produce to take home. It offered great value for a very unique experience in an old part of London.||August 3, 2018
krenno2||50||Lots of choices (and delicious looking ones) for instantly served meals, as well as foods to take away and prepare at home. So much to choose from, there is something for everyone. Very busy and crowded with both tourists and locals alike, but a must do to see and eat too for any visit to London.||August 2, 2018
M670AJterryl||50||What a tremendous collection of sights, tastes, sounds, from all around the globe. Got to shop here for food, got to stop for Street food of every kind. The variety will astound, and the experience is not to be missed.||August 2, 2018
Sydney1005||50||I love street foods! If you like to explore and try street foods london style, this is the place to be. Lunch meals, jams, jelly, best cheeses and more. One of my best experiences in London.||August 2, 2018
maisieheath||50||It’s very fitting that London, as an extremely diverse city, has a plethora of cuisines to match its international community of inhabitants and visitors. Borough market offers both fresh produce including: truffles, oysters and bread; and meals including: falafel wraps, Indian snacks and Ethiopian curries. It’s also great that it’s directly opposite London Bridge Station: making it convenient for a pre-journey snack or a supermarket shop (of sorts). I would really recommend Bread Ahead and the goats milk ice cream place. ||August 2, 2018
wyotravels||40||Great lunch spot when visiting the Southwark area (Globe, London Eye, Tate Modern, etc.) Variety if food stand options including Korean buns, German sausages, BBQ, Ethiopian food, falafel, and delicious baked goods just to name a few. Seating can be tough to find, though there are many benches near the front glassed entrance, so be prepared to eat while standing. There is at least one station where you can fill your water bottle - a rarity in London. ||August 1, 2018
ckn0206||50||A lively food market with lots of opportunities to eat your way around the world. From Argentina to Ethiopia and everywhere in between. Spices from all points east to Herdwick lamb from the fells, the smells are amazing. I got morcilla from a Spanish deli||August 1, 2018
gennyagnew||50||My friend & I went with 5 kids and had a blast. All the owners of the stands were super nice and friendly towards us and the kidsKids walked around with delicious bacon sandwiches.The adults had Oysters and Champagne, we ate and drank standing but loved it.For dessert kids found a fudge and ice cream stand.My friend & I are originally from London but now leave in Hong Kong & USA, our tourist kids loved the Borough Market!Highly recommend!||July 31, 2018
heref0rthebeer||30||Like my pubs in this area very busy. There selection of keg and cask beers did not excite me. Service is really slow. Survives on a great location. Oh and the loos were disgusting||July 31, 2018
manderjones||40||Perhaps the most prestigious market in London and rightly so. Packed with tourists from all walks of life, this place has solid workstations that concoct all sorts of grub from far and wide. Besides the mounds of fresh fruit and veg, fish is really what you should come here to sample. The piping hot pork roast sandwiches, cornish pasties, among lines of gleaming oysters and cockles make newcomers rethink there's much more to English grub than simple fish and chips and fry-ups.The market dates back to the thirteen century making it the oldest in the city. The green framed premises with metal lacework and glass roof, coupled with the matching signs naming each outlet are quite charming. Arrive before noon on Saturdays if you want to avoid lengthy queues for hot options.||July 30, 2018
jim m||50||Wonderful place - and if you are hungry the all the better but one can also feed on the smells and sounds, the colours and textures that surround you. There are a few stalls that are a bit meh but vast majority are interesting and good quality. plenty of samples and places to eat - very busy so be security minded - easy to loose young children.||July 30, 2018

Fiona G||40||Love, love the stalls and shops at Borough Food Market.French, Italian, Spanish Cheeses, Small goods, breads, Olives......a Foodies dream with treasures to be found and consumed.There are not enough seats to sit and consume your purchases, few and far between in fact on site.There are a couple of restaurants that face on to the markets but as we found out in a rude and abrupt way, even though there are chairs and tables available on the terrace and even though their kitchen closes at 2.30 pm, Arthur Coopers won’t allow you to even consume some bread you may have bought at a market stall, even though you buy their wine and olives, you are told to stop consuming your bread, buy theirs or leave.The only terrace empty, we occupied 3 spaces and spent our money on their overpriced wine and olives and told to leave.All other restaurants and bars full and overflowing, Arthur Coopers empty terrace is witness to their poor attitude toward paying customers.Real shame that the Manager and table staff haven’t grasped the reality of their involvement at the markets and that they have the most to learn, from their most disgruntled customers.||July 29, 2018

Captn_Steven||50||Treat yourself to a true delight and visit Borough Market! While not as famous as Big Ben, Buckingham Palace or the London Bridge it’s a must see. The market is loaded with cuisine from all over the world. Booth after booth of beautifully displayed freshly made foods from breads to meats. Numerous sit down dining options including Mexican! Baked goods, amazing Olives, saw a whole pig. We are going back for Christmas and I plan on having a German sausage which looked amazing. The coffee shop Monmouth Coffee Company is absolutely Delicious. It’s was very busy and we visited on a weekday! We picked up a moose truffle pate which was divine along with a loaf of amazing fresh bread. Numerous wine stores which was great to take back to our hotel. Warning it’s a busy place go early and pick a weekday if at all possible. The Borough Market is locates very near the London Tower Bridge. Easy walk between the two attractions. Wear comfy shoes. If you are a shutter bug like myself the photo opportunities are endless. Great place to people watch! The Borough Market website was very helpful especially the map and directory.||July 28, 2018
JaLaw76||50||Visited here with our two daughters to have breakfast and wonder around. Food was amazing and diverse, the atmosphere was exciting and the amenities were clean and adequate. A must visit for any trip to London.||July 27, 2018
alaaaW7979JE||30||I had great expectations for this market. I imagined the place would be a lot bigger and more diverse. The market was good overall with decent choices and a variety of option for foodies.||July 27, 2018
Cadillacjay||50||We visited London in early July to attend a music festival in Hyde Park. We stayed the week to explore London. Due to the timing, most other popular sites were extremely busy with long queues. We decided to explore the neighborhoods of London and came upon this market. It is a covered market built of iron and glass. There is a great variety of foods, (both prepared and fresh) as well as vendors selling mostly local crafts. We stopped and had a nice mug of sangria, We had previously had lunch otherwise we would have found something good here I'm sure. It's a great 1 hour (or so) explore.||July 27, 2018
eligoncas7||50||This market is foodies heaven . You taste food from all over the world. I ate at La Tua Pasta and it was the best I ever had just walking around..... No places to sit but its so delicious that I didnt care . I had to go for a second time and it was still amazing . If yoy love to just experience new food dont miss it.Its a market so no expectations for being confortable . Worth going.||July 27, 2018
SmurfRammy||50||A revelation! My first visit but definitely not my last! The food offering is amazing and the atmosphere superb. Northfield butchers is a must for a great burger. Went at 2pm and it was pleasantly not crowded. ||July 26, 2018

Mira M||40||The borough market is close to Shakespeare's Globe, so it's a good place to go afterwards and have a nice snack, they have some amazing sweets and breads. It's also very cheap, and so a good choice for those with a tight budget. Just beware the crowds during peak time.||July 26, 2018
Lira V||50||Borough Market was a big surprise on my first visit in London. It was love at first sight :).We tasted some delicious specialties in there, and we bought some to take home. You can find everything in it, different type of cheeses, oyster stores, organic fruits and veggies, truffles, etc.The pubs around Borough Market are lovely as well.||July 26, 2018

You can get plenty of drink options while you check out the food on offer. The pasta store was a great hit as was the venison burger. The amazing Spanish carved meat too was a great shop! ||July 24, 2018

Ecostew22||50||Recently visited borough market timing it for a late lunch and a perfect excuse to sample as much as we could.The market is massive and busy but doesn’t feel overcrowded at any time. The market traders sell an amazing array of food stuffs to satisfy the most hardcore foodie.Worth a visit for the free samples alone but chat to the market traders and you can’t help but get drawn in by their passion and pride in the products. We could spend all day here eating and drinking our way around! ||July 23, 2018
Alison C||50||We have to pop by borough market everytime we come to London. It’s a a great stop, and full of life. The food stalls are amazing. So much choice . I usually eat a vegan burger from Big V London . I actually am a vegan, but this time , my non vegan husband tried one of their burgers too and was delighted by the taste. There at a lot of stalls selling oils, cheeses, coffees, cake and pastries, smoothies, veg, spices, it’s great. You can also go and stand by the pub that was in the Bridget Jones films, right by her flat door in fact if you were a photo snapping tourist.||July 23, 2018

plantbasedpiget||50||Love it here, they had such a great eange of fresh fruit and veg as well as breads and cakes, that are vegan friendly. The other side of the market has lots of vegan places to eat like Pieminster. A great place to go at the weekend and try new foods.||July 23, 2018
jo_rennie||50||I have visited Borough Market twice now once in July last year and again in May this year when I've been down visiting my son who is at Uni in London. It is a fabulous place and I could easily spend all day there. Wonderful smells, sights and tastes you can truly use all your senses when you visit. On my visit this year I was able to see a wonderful demo in the kitchen by Chef Neil Forbes from Café St Honore in Edinburgh who I know - it just so happened I saw on your facebook page that he was to be there. This is definitely somewhere I would make a point of visiting anytime I am in London and I would thoroughly recommend it.||July 23, 2018
Steve-70||50||A little hesitant coming here after events in the past but Wow what a beautiful place to come and see fresh food and produce - had the most amazing Scallops cooked in front of us along with a Seafood Paella..Topped the day off by buying some cheese and dips for the afternoon session. Great pubs right next door also.||July 22, 2018
Bubiana||50||In the two years since we had been to London, we still had dreams about the food there. So much choice from fresh market fare to cooked street food and sweets. The market is consistent with the same vendors selling the same fare even 2 years later. Its worth a trip to the Borough Cheese Co and Bread Ahead, there is something to tempt everyone! I recommend getting here early (with Jetlag we were there around 9am) so you can avoid the crowds as it gets super busy, particularly around lunch time!||July 22, 2018
natsydaus||50||Love the aesthetic of this market; head to Monmouth coffee for a good espresso. It was super packed and busy every afternoon (it may be like this all the time; or it may be the summer)||July 22, 2018
StroopwafelAMS||50||It's in an extremely tourist-y area, but doesn't make it an overpriced market to visit. If you're nearby -tourist or local- walk around and eat, eat, eat, and eat some more. Enjoy the ambience, and buy a bit of everything so you can try the wide variety of food they have to offer.||July 22, 2018
lizs15||40||An iconic market which seems to get better with age. Love this market and all the lovely food vendors. The food, the free tastings, the atmosphere. One negative is the limited seating around the market. My friend and I filled up with free samples of gorgeous cheeses of the world, slices of cured meats and various other treats. Only to discover across the walkway an entire area of food trucks serving delicious food‍♀️ So we decided to go for the famous fish and chips and it was lovely. Fresh and crispy. In hindsight we should have had one fish and chips and tried something else as well. So many choices. From Indian to Italian. The fruit and flowers were also exceptional. We particularly loved the stall with the spices, lots of variety an very reasonably priced. A must see if you are in London.||July 22, 2018
Rosgerry||50||Borough Market has existed in one form or another for around 1,000 years. Its precise start date is impossible to pin down: there was no official opening, no ribbon-cutting ceremony, not even a brief mention in a chronicle. The best date available, and the one used as the basis for the Market’s millennium celebration, is 1014.Borough, then as now, was a place defined by its position at one end of London Bridge—for centuries, the only route across the river into the capital. It is likely that London’s first post-Roman bridge was constructed here in the mid-990s, partly to bolster the city’s defences against Viking raiders who routinely sailed up the Thames to kick seven shades of wattle and daub out of the locals.||July 22, 2018

londontochiangrai||40||I've been using the market for a long time and have seen it change dramatically in the last 5-10 years. Now it is most definitely a tourist destination. It is very busy and every stall is competing to get people to buy food or drink. The variety of food is very good but the price and value for money is a bit questionable. The stalls charge the maximum they can and the portions are generally small and tightly controlled. As an example I heard the man on the paella stall telling his team to make sure they didn't put more prawns on a plate.If I've got visitors or fancy a wander then a great place to go, but as a local for somewhere to lunch, not so sure.||July 22, 2018
jacquim883||40||One of London's main attractions, Borough Market is just a short walk from London Bridge station. The visitor is greeted with aromas and colour from an array of stalls, from fresh meat, cheeses, bread, wine, to those cooking delicious meals while you wait. To do the market any justice, you probably need at least 2 hours. And best to arrive hungry!||July 22, 2018

My recommendation would be the Ethiopian stall - suggest go for the large mix combo, meat, two veg sides and bread - £6.95 can’t be bad. Choices for everyone vegetarians and vegan options great, my daughter would recommend soul food! Then slinked into a couple of bars nearby.... still there now!||July 20, 2018

vic9921||50||Having been round the Tower of London and Tower Bridge my feet were not wanting a lunch “on the hoof” in Borough Market even though the stalls had very tempting treats on offer. There are few places to sit and eat, and those are often beside the jostling crowds, but Fish is a haven. My Senegalese companion had been told evil things about British cuisine and so it was an opportunity to let him try decent fish, chips and mushy peas. They were amongst the best I have ever eaten.We didn’t really have room for more but a sticky toffee pudding had to be offered as the Best of British. It is said to have originated at the Sharoe Bay, but when Bill Scott had the River House at Skipool Creek he always swore his mother had given her family recipe to them. The River House versión used a little more lemon than the Fish version and it does help balance the sweetness, but if I visit Borough Market again Fish is where I will eat. ||July 17, 2018
Peter H||50||A melting pot of people from local workers to tourists from across the world. This market has a great atmosphere and is always busy. It has some amazing stalls selling most food stuffs you could ever imagine, from the very best fruit and veg, to cheeses form around the world and excellent meat and fish. Then there are the aromas, every step you take a new one fills your nostrils, these are form the street food vendors selling freshly cook produce from ever corner of the globe.And for those who want a more leisurely meal, there are more than a hand full of excellent restaurants, from Fish to Tapas. My favorite is Fish where you can sit outside or in and watch the colorful market life pass by. While eating England's favorite dish, fish and chips. I used to work close to the market so went there most days for lunch. ||July 17, 2018

This foodie was great impressed! Can’t wait to go back!! ||July 17, 2018

chubby_wanderer||50||We had some amazing salted beef, excellent chips with beef drippings at Nana Fanny's in Borough Market. We tried some of the traditional salted beef (which was excellent), but for me, the real star is the beef dripping chips. They had a rich flavor and the crunch of good chips. I highly recommend stopping by.||July 16, 2018

You can combine visit with Tate Modern, 10min. walk.||July 15, 2018
jube10||10||I was very much looking forward to visiting here. What a disappointment. Dirty and no where to sit to enjoy the food. Why should you have to sit on a dirty concrete step or huddle up an alleyway to eat your lunch. The seats provided might look great but are useless. Why not provide some long tables so people can talk to one another and enjoy their food purchases. For inspiration look at the Prahan markets in Melbourne. ||July 15, 2018
Boro_Steve||40||I've visited Borough Market on several occasions and on each visit I try hard to find something different to eat. I've tried pad thai noodles which were ok, German bratwurst with sauerkraut, mmmmmmm, Boston burger with bacon, mmmmmm and today I tried the slow cooked rose veal with east Mediterranean salads from Gourmet Goat. It's in the mmmmmmm category The veal was so tender it melted in my mouth, the salads really complemented it and the Smokey bbc sauce was a perfect accompaniment. I washed it down with a lovely ice cold pint of elderflower cider...so refreshing on a warm day.I'm not going to say anything else about the food you can find in the market as other reviewers have already done so. If you are visiting London on holiday then allow time for lunch here. Hint, avoid Saturday's and go midweek, it's much quieter!||July 14, 2018
RovingCivilEngineer||40||It's am international market, with produce from across the globe.The quality of the goods appears to be good - but we weren't buying - just looking.Having said that we did get some ingredients that we have only found online before!Lots and lots of places to eat.Quite good fun, and a at the end of a nice walk along the South Bank from Westminster Bridge. The Golden Hinde is docked nearby!!||July 14, 2018
Popsypops||50||Having spent a few days in absolutely gorgeous London, my sister & I went to this market. It was bustling around lunchtime & everone looked as if they were all enjoying themselves. I don’t think there is anything you cannot find. There is a huge selection of food one can have for lunch from any part of the world & that includes drinks. It is absolutely fascinating & very well worth a visit.||July 14, 2018
peripateticjim||40||What a feast for all the senses, but especially every taste. Something for everyone, from plain to very exotic (crocodile, anyone?)||July 13, 2018
Soko37||40||Food market for cheese , sausages, veggies , fruits and other delicates. Surrounded by pubs, cafes and restaurants. Very close to London Bridge station for public transport. Enjoy ||July 13, 2018
Maari100||50||I happened to visit there at 9 am having just had a breakfast at the hotel. Thus not able enjoy of the delicacies and restaurants here. Cheeses, spices, meat, fish, bakery products, cafes, restaurants, tasting whatever. Everything was beautifully displayed. Metro stop Tower Bridge||July 13, 2018
Alison F||50||Such an amazing food market! You can eat at food stalls or buy stuff to take home and cook your own meal. It does not disappoint, everyone is friendly and helpful. Come hungry, leave happy.||July 12, 2018
Princess90||40||Great place to visit and see all the different foods from all corners of the world. Have been before on a Saturday when it was crazy and you couldn't move for people so next visit I went on a Monday and it was so much calmer and we could actually get to see some of the stalls and taste some of the foods.||July 12, 2018
26lillys||50||What is there not to love about Borough Market? If you love good food, wine or beers, baked goods and sweet treats, do visit here. There is London food to be had, whether at Maria’s caff (bubble and squeak and sausages in a roll to start things off) or bread pudding, breads, cakes, game and butchery. The fruit and veg is exceptional here at Borough, traders shout out about their wares for sale, samples are always offered out. This place proves Britain has the most amazing hard working food producers. Goats milk ice cream a treat, jugs of iced Pimms lining various bars and stalls. Hot food to take away, fresh juices to cool you, this is my happy place.||July 12, 2018
MyPet123||40||The historic Borough Market has had a face-lift in recent years. It is now trendy, 'Hipster' and expensive. 5 minutes walk from The Shard and 7-8 minutes walk from an NCP car park (If you absolutely have to go by car). Otherwise take the Underground.Lots of upmarket stalls/shops selling mostly foods. Everyone we met was friendly which tends to put a smile on ones face. Lunch or high tea at Hotel Chocolat helps to break the day. Enjoy yourself.||July 12, 2018
Danielle N||30||We were close by after a different activity so we decided to walk over and see about maybe getting some street food. It was the weekend, so BIG mistake. It was so crowded you could barely move. I stopped at one vendor and bought a treat and kept walking forward trying to escape as quickly as possible...should have just turned around and went back the way we came. Thank goodness I use a baby carrier instead of a stroller, there would be no way! People bumping into each other, shoulder to shoulder traffic, its anxiety inducing. I would not go again on a weekend, maybe not ever||July 12, 2018
asiganamadrid||40||I walked across London Bridge from my nearby hotel to check out Borough Market. I was there on a weekend, so it was very busy (so much so that it can be difficult to walk make your way through the crowd at times). There are all sorts of kiosks selling food such as paella, sausages, fried fish, BBQ, as well as vendors selling bottled foods and other wares. There are a few of sit-down restaurants and random shops on the side streets. Most people I saw bought food and then find a nearby curb or other open space to eat their food, or just stand up to eat it. I ended up at one of the sit-down restaurants as I am not a fan of eating on the street. There was also a bit of a entertainment too - a guy playing the tuba along with recorded accompaniment, with flames coming out of the bell of the tuba.||July 11, 2018
phiklphox||40||If you aren't sure what you want to eat then take a walk around Borough Market and you're sure to find something to take your fancy. The choice is brilliant and varied.The market can be varied so when you've made your choice, there are plenty of opportunities to just step back and people watch - there are certainly lots of people always milling around.||July 11, 2018
Emyr1||50||Having worked near Borough Market for several years, I thought I knew it well - buzzing on Fridays and Saturdays, a bit small-scale and quiet the rest of the time. Things have certainly changed; on a Wednesday morning it was packed with the most wonderful sights and smells - and people. In a league of its own for this type of market now. ||July 11, 2018
Bodazapher||50||Borough Market is a fantastic bustling place at any time offering a diverse range of food and drink. It’s next to The Shard, rather than pay to go up take the lift to the Shangrila hotel for a free panoramic view of London from the 43rd floor. For something completely different walk round the corner and visit the Crossbones Graveyard a tribute to the ‘Winchester Geese’.||July 11, 2018
WalkingInLA||50||Is place appeals to all your senses. So fun to walk around and see the breads, cakes, cheeses, sandwiches, meals, desserts, etc. Absolutely fresh and fantastic. We went at 10 am when nobody was there yet. They were preparing the meals. Free wifi, and free water bottle refill near the exit.||July 11, 2018
BireswarR||30||You'll find it in most reviews of London visits. The Borough market . Quite disappointing though , as the place didnt really appeal as a proper Farmer's market , but more of a Overpriced touristic place. Ofcourse you can take nice colorful pictures to impress . But the food stuff wasnt of good value. Good collection of Cheese though.||July 10, 2018

jacquie k||40||Taking a family of relations to Borough Market and London Bridge on a nice walk. The market is very expensive but well worth a visit you can see on the old streets and old parts of London. Also worth a visit is the Globe Theatre!You can have some tastings and the stall holders are very friendly but the food for purchase it very high quality for you to enjoy so as the saying goes "you get what you pay for in quality." Very popular with Chinese and foreign visitors.||July 10, 2018
RoamingNomad1||40||From your standard fruit and veg through to venison, this market has the vibrancy, originality and fantastic atmosphere you would expect from traditional indoor market traders. The smells, sights and sounds are great for any tourist or local alike.||July 10, 2018
Montholme1||30||Good to experience, excellentt vibe, but quite hyped up for what it is and products are very expensive||July 9, 2018
Ron G||50||My favorite place in London; make that favorite in all of England. Best to go on a weekend, because many of the stalls are closed during the week. However, try and get there by about 10:30 a.m. because afterward this place is packed to the gills with people. Come ready to taste a LOT of different foodstuffs.||July 9, 2018
Amy M||40||This is the place to go for an incredible selection of cheeses, breads, veg and meats (think charcuterie platters). Go early to avoid real crowds and watch your wallets! Pickpocketers abound.||July 9, 2018
KJBopinion||50||The smells, the hustle and bustle, the scenery, its amazing. I know for some people it's a commute to work or every day activity but if you are a tourist who wants to experience something a little different then definitely visit here and spend as long or as little time as you like. ||July 9, 2018
Alan S||50||Buy flowers, meat, veggies even mushrooms. Outstanding place to eat lunch at scores of vendors. Not to be missed. Lots of fun||July 9, 2018
Mark L||40||It is the food market of old London town. There is no greater range of gourmet and specialist foods, this side of the English Channel. The regional and national varieties of cheeses are incomperable. From Welsh marsh lamb and the best bacon and butcher's produce from the Ginger Pigto specialist French delicacies, wines and beers. The best time to visit for that hustle and bustle that only a great and historic market canproduce is the weekend. One word of warning - it aint cheap.||July 9, 2018
danielfN4142ES||50||The market is authentic as can be and the variety of goods and interesting character is beyond belief. Vendors appreciate your business and this a London experience that is truly unique and fun.||July 9, 2018
Darlene W||50||Great place a must.....Eat at the restaurant at the top called Roast. Authentic English... Fresh food and great experience you won't be disappointed. Walking distance to the London Eye||July 9, 2018
Jackel35||50||Sometimes you just want quality and this market is the place to go.Cheese, mushrooms, sweet treats, meat, all from small specialist producers.I would suggest you make a day of it, book lunch at Brindisi or Roast, plan for a few drinks and get a cab home with your bags of luxury goodies.Lovely bit of London that as a chef I love.||July 9, 2018
B H||50||This place has the best street food you can find in London. The place is packed and the food is great. I would recommend swinging in for lunch.||July 9, 2018

M W||40||Borough market on a sunny day in London is amazing! There is a wide range of eateries with vegan and healthy eaters provided for! Taste those samples which are all around the market and much your way through a selection of pieces of bread, crackers, pates, and fruit. The old and new market come together and the buzz of people will keep you going for hours! Enjoy :-)||July 9, 2018
928nataliek||50||We went for lunch nearby and I ended up looking around before I head off to the airport. Whenever I come to London, I always come here as there are so many to see! Just love walking around! ||July 9, 2018
DawgPound81||50||Oh, man, the choices! We ended up with Ethiopian and cheese sandwiches. Shared and it was all great. Then we bought Greek for dessert and pastries for next breakfast. Really, could’ve gone back every day and had something different each meal.||July 9, 2018
lindseylo3||50||Borough market had every type of food you can ever imagine. We sampled a little bit of everything. After we ate here, we sat outside and watched the mad rush of everyone getting off work, very cool to see. ||July 8, 2018
Bubblechucks||50||I have been shopping at Borough Market for nearly twenty years. This historic market is right by Southwark Cathedral. Over the years, I have seen it develop into a tourist attraction of its own, but it also has a crowd of folks like me who go there regularly to find real seasonable food that is produced and sold by people who care about their produce. I have my favourite places for buying beef, chicken, game in season, fish, cheese, wild mushrooms, and fruit. There are plenty of places to buy lunches, but this time - 7 July - I went in search of food for a picnic. I bought mushroom pate from Pate Moi; chicken liver pate from Wild Beef; excellent tomatoes, apricots and grapes from Chegworth Valley; tortana loaf (mild sourdough bread baked in the shape of a ring from Flour Station; fresh goat cheese from Une Normande a Londres (a favourite stall), some saladings, and some British charcuterie. And if you like ice cream, then stop at the Greedy Goat stall for a delicious treat. They even do old-fashioned rum and raisin ice. With all these treasures, the addition of French butter and good home made fruit cup, we had a splendid picnic in the warm sun and celebrated England's win over Sweden in the World Cup quarter finals.||July 8, 2018
inorbi||40||It is a great place in the morning, but beware if you happen to go there in the afternoon. The stalls close rather early, we were finishing our delicious nigerian chicken, when people started to drag out the benches from under us. Compared to other streetfood some foods are prices, but the market itself is a great experience.||July 8, 2018
Angelagraham52||50||We where recommended by our air b n b host to come here for a wander around. Really great market plenty to see And taste. I would recommend going to the butcher for a pie I believe it was called the ginger pig. Really amazing stuff.||July 8, 2018
de-oppresso-liber||40||There is so much foodie places to visit and eat its a bit overwhelming. Practically any food from any culture or place is there to be eaten. Everything from craft cheeses to food stalls. We tried many different foods and left there stuffed and very happy. You can eat relatively cheaply too. Borough Market is near all the touristy hot spots. So visit the sights and then go eat . . see more sights and eat some more.||July 7, 2018
Rich0200||40||Had a nice time visiting Borough Market, which is broadly in two parts - the actual historical market and the street food part. There is lots of choice! We went for the Ethiopian, which looks a little messy in the picture but believe me tasted fantastic and was great value. There are a few shops surrounding the market, but not as many as say Greenwich Market, which sort of limits what there is to see there beyond the stall themselves, but there is a great atmosphere. It is close to The Shard for those that want to visit that. We didn't but walked from there all the way along the Thames to Westminster, which I'd definitely recommend!||July 7, 2018
RahulMD||50||This is an excellent place to grab a quick bite to eat. The prices are reasonable and there are many selections of different cuisines to choose from which I think would satisfy most people. It’s also in very close proximity to the Shakespeare Globe. Good spot to get lunch if you are visiting the Globe. ||July 7, 2018
M T||50||I first came to Borough Market at the suggestion of a tour guide a few years ago and loved it. The variety of vendors cater to every craving and dietary needs I can think of.When we came back this summer, I knew I had to bring my boyfriend here. We walked through the whole place once just to sum up our choices before committing to something.We not only got lunch, but dessert and some wine soaked cheese to take back to our flat. It was a laid back way to spend our first afternoon in town whole adjusting to our jet lag.I highly recommend the market if you're looking for a variety of choices, many international and want something reasonably priced.||July 6, 2018
dharleigh s||50||Lots of different choices of cheese and bread. Also have some seafood area, tea, fruits etc. One of my favorite was toasted bread with grilled cheese on it always craving for it. Also bought some tea that i brought back to home place it was fantastic. Must visit this place. Much busy during weekend and take note not to many toilet available here as I find it hard to find another coz the one only available was long q. ||July 5, 2018
Smarty_Maddu||40||The atmosphere was vibrant (as expected in a genuine market, which has existed since 1756) though the veggies and fish were not the top items, rather the wide variety of food items available to taste are...||July 4, 2018

6TeamB4||30||Nice place to wander around and take in all the stalls. Saying this avoid lunchtimes in the summer as it is packed and uncomfortable. Head there in the morning or evening when its less busy||July 4, 2018
KimsoonL||40||The place has a wide variety of food and reasonably price. There is Singapore laksa, Thai food, African food with fresh big prawn. The market is divided into 2 segment, 1 that sells bakery food & another that sells street food. Delicious and do try especially for 1st timer to London.||July 3, 2018
ztacir||50||Go to SouthBank and stroll by the Thames river until you arrive at Borough Market. You can have incredible food of any kind. During weekends, it can get extremely crwoded. Dont forget to walk on the streets around the market.||July 3, 2018
superdad62||50||This place was great food from all over the world and taste nice price very good for London so much to see the shop are good lots of choices spice shop really good loads of cheese and meat shop would recommend a visit ||July 2, 2018
issa81||40||Went to this market on a Monday, sadly almost half of it was shut. Closest tube station is London bridge on the Northern line, and market right next to station.Market is under train bridge, and contains many hot food stations, in addition to food shops.The seafood booth was great, had very tasty oysters for 2.5 pounds each. A man helps you loosen them with a knife, places them on ice in a plate and hands over to be eaten with a twist of lemon.I also bought some herb sausages and aged cheese from a French booth, and berries from a fruits and vegetables shop.Hot food section versatile too, well worth a visit.||July 2, 2018
Christine S||50||A micro capsule of the tastes of London and England. Vendors are varied and plentiful - very friendly and willing to chat - very proud of their products ! Our trip was too short but I always return to Borough Market whenever in London. It never disappoints!||July 2, 2018

Marvin Y||50||So yeah, it's touristy, but it's also amazing for the variety, quality, and diversity of foodstuffs. Some of the booths are just incredible. We went around lunch during a weekday and it was packed with tourists and workers getting lunch. The number of choices is vast and there's enough there from seafood to Thai to Ethiopian to burgers to pies to salt beef to, well, you get the picture. Just about any type of cuisine your heart desires.||July 2, 2018
jasonrH8431IC||50||This was probably my favorite foodie place in London. I literally spent my time there eating from one shop while I ordered from another. You really can’t go wrong here.||July 1, 2018
carolinecZ6950CO||50||Swing by on a Saturday (or throughout the week) for some great treats. So much food to choose from! Also recommend a trip over to Iron Flat Square's vintage market for a stroll around and a pint.||July 1, 2018
paul_ark_2014||50||Great way to spend a weekend lunch if you love sampling a variety of foods, drinks and desserts from a variety of stalls & vendors; definitely bring an appetite! No much seating at all, so be prepared to eat standing up or on the go.||July 1, 2018
Shazhill||50||I love the vibrancy of this market. So many fantastic stalls packed with fresh produce. We had chorizo sausage sandwiches for lunch.... delicious.||July 1, 2018
Waddler||50||This one is a cracker. It pulls in tourists yet pulls in locals too. If looking for great ingredients for that meal at home I know discerning Londoners who wouldn’t go anywhere else with their Saturday morning shopping bag.But you can come to get great on the spot street food, cafe food, coffees etc.Definitely worth a look.||July 1, 2018
Jackie B||50||Wow what a place the atmosphere is wonderful so much food to taste , don’t be thinking of your waist line here a beautiful gem to find I well recommended this place to visit, to feel the the atmosphere and smell so many different foods, an good mix of ethnic foods .||July 1, 2018
GreenZooGooseFeet||40||Visited market whilst on pleasure trip to London - stopped for breakfast between tube rides and this was really close to the stationWe had lovely mooch round before finding a fabulous Italian deli with amazing mozzarella and pesto focaccia Lovely atmosphere, everyone was helpful and courteous Also had delicious coffees from an indie cart Amazing cheeses and some fab bread and cake stallsWell worth a visit!||June 30, 2018
Geoff333_13||40||This is a 'must do' if visiting London, especially at lunchtime. It is busy but there is a lot on offer for everyone, including coeliacs and vegetarians. Some stalls sell gluten free food exclusively. You need to take a walk through the food area before making your decision and then go back to the food of choice, otherwise you will buy something and find something better a few stalls away. You won't find a seat so you can eat your food as you stroll and find a nearby pub to wash it down. A real buzz, but not for everyone.||June 30, 2018
55delaneyw||40||Borough Market has food for almost anyone. There is seafood to gluten free bakeries and chocolatiers to cheese shops. The market is gigantic, but unfortunately there isn’t any seating in the market so you have to stand up against a wall to eat your food. Nonetheless it’s definitely a great London activity!||June 30, 2018
665majak||50||Amazing market. Such a nice stop if you are walking down the Southbank and take a break to eat lunch. I recommend the prosecco stand at the entrance of the market, Indian food, smoothies, juices, fudge and cookies. Such a great market, 100% recommend!||June 30, 2018
ElmoMasey||50||Hot weather + Busy market = Prosecco Slushies! There was a vendor selling alcoholic Slushies quite cheaply and they were AMAZING! There were lots of little stalls selling deli hour selling food and gorgeous looking handmade clothing and accessories. I loved walking around and everyone was so friendly. It's very close to the river and loads of great little restaurants and bars too.||June 30, 2018
SafarKhaana||50||The Borough market was a pleasant surprise! It’s a food lover’s dream. It’s a huge market under the bridge. You’ve got to visit it to actually know what it’s like.At the Borough market, you will find all sorts of food products. You will see little cafes serving their food. Then you will find a fresh fruit market, a vegetable market, a meat and fish market!. Bakers put up their stalls with different goodies on display. You will find everything from baked breads to cheesecakes. You will see vendors selling different kinds of cheese. I just loved this market. Name anything to eat and Borough market has it fresh and made on spot. This market is bustling with tourists who really like to sample to various food items and talk to the vendors. Wonderful experience! ||June 29, 2018
kelly L||50||Liked the place.a lot of local food stands, fresh fish, fruit, veggies etc but also delicious meals and snacks||June 29, 2018
xVIIImax||30||This market is a victim of its own success. Absolutely overcrowded on weekends. Go during the week (Wednesday to ensure all the booths are operational) when you can spend a bit of time choosing what to try, and hopefully finding a seat. ||June 28, 2018
Jean L||50||Borough Market is located on the south side of the river. If you are walking, aim for the Shard, and if you are using the Tube, get out at London Bridge Tube StationAlthough this is very much a working market ( as against a tourist market ),it is a great place to wonder through even if you have no need to buy food. The Market specialises in fresh fruit; veg.; meat ; cheeses ;fish ; an amazing selection of breads, and a great selection of savouries. Being a market, a great number of stall holders appear to operate on a cash only basis.Three things I particularly like about this market are -1) it is covered (2) the freshness of the products on offer, and (3) the quality, and I think it is the latter which makes this market special.The market was only open from Thursday to Saturday when we visited, and gets very busy between 12 and 2, so my advice is to go earlier if possible.||June 28, 2018
selincik||50||I love this market You can have street food and shop at the same time. A must see place on LondonFish and chips is good but not great still many food choice available ||June 28, 2018
AbhishekS4354||50||The first look of the place itself is so tantalising, so different to what you would have seen, pubs coffee houses street quick eateries all so well mixed up..lot and lots of places to eat on the other inside the market, you are spoilt for choices from fresh vegetables and fruits, Turkish delight, Indian platter. My favourite pick was the Ethiopian food .. I missed coming here in my last visit to London, happy that I did not miss this time .. in the after noon.. it will be crowded .. but that is the real fun..||June 28, 2018
raymondsI2995IP||50||Awesome place to visit to try many wonderful foods from around the world. Countless stalls selling goods and very friendly staff. ||June 28, 2018
ChicaVoya||40||Certainly not in a pretty part of London, Borough Market is nonetheless charming in its sheer breadth of genuine family-run businesses, street food stalls and diversity of fresh produce from across the world. Definitely worth a visit on a warm day, but avoid lunch time as it becomes stiflingly busy.||June 28, 2018
Paul W||40||If you fancy the idea of seeing an abundance of food undercover,?then I reckon the Borough market will be the right place for you to go.Its good to hear & see the market traders going about their business,trying to tempt you to visit them,and then supply you with some treats.This place has been there for so many years,and there is evidence of the past,with some old trader signs on the wall as you walk around.Summing up,a place to tickle your taste buds,and finally a marvellous old part of London to enjoy.||June 27, 2018
bigj6348||50||YES YES YES is all I have to say. food was amazing and the prices is quite good considering some the of the food stalls are expensive.try it!||June 27, 2018
Sairam N||50||If a food lover then Eat your way (in this hygiene and clean environment ) and do purchasing of fresh vegetables, fruits and any kind of meat/sea food .||June 26, 2018
Unifire||40||Lots of food, vegetables, tea, spices, and so on from all around the world. If possible try to visit in weekdays before lunchtime, or early afternoon, as the market is crowded on saturdays and around lunchtime, where everybody queue up around the food stands. If you have patience enough to walk from stand to stand, then you will definitely end up buying something and there are some real gems there, but in the last couple of year it has become a bit more of a tourist attraction, which also means the prices is going up and up. A must see if you are in the area.||June 26, 2018

Lissel A||40||Vibrant, reasonably priced, hopping with people - this is definitely a market not to be missed. You can eat your way around the market - our senses led us to venison burgers, brownies, gooseberries, and spices. You can dine in at some locations, but we found it more fun to buy small things as we progressed. Being near the end of our hols we weren't able to buy food for groceries, only to eat, so that limited some options. But it was still fun to look around.||June 26, 2018
Bernard T||50||Location is very good and closed to tube station, London Bridge. It is always crowded with many visitors because of different varieties of delicious foods, including the cooked ones, fruits, sea foods, fresh oysters, organic drinks, vegetables as well as different kinds of bread, cheese and tea etc. They are cheap indeed.||June 25, 2018
cdbwilliams||50||You have to visit this place. It's an open fresh market that also sells cooked foods. I'm thrilled we stopped here.||June 25, 2018
AmericanDr||40||My husband and I were at London in mid June, and we spent one day at around London Bridge and had lunch at Borough Market. It is basically full of different stalls with food from all over the world. We had lunch there and had Egyptian salad, meat pie, fish and chips, German hot dogs, juices, cheese, coffees and much more, I wish to have dinner there but they closed at around 5. An amazing food expedition experience.||June 25, 2018
MoniqueZon||50||Great place, so much to chose from, food from all over the world. Quiet busy though and you have to have patience to get what you want. We decided for the V Burger, the most amazing vegetarian burger I ever had.||June 25, 2018

Amazing food options such as hot food from various regions, selection of fudge, cheese, bread, vegan food, jams and spreads - you name it and Borough market probably has it! The drinks vary depending on the seasons - absolutely must visit!||June 25, 2018
LO70||50||A lively market offering all sort of organic and authentic food, " cooked live" to your eyes and offered in generous portions. You can here find any kind of food, from English wild beef and lamb to any kind of pies, to an international range of cheeses, Thay, Chinese, Spanish, Lebanese, Italian delicacies and all sort of chocolate. You can taste raw shellfish and oysters of various kind offered on ice-covered trays and different "help yourself seasonings". Organic fruits and vegetable on sale, along with fresh organic juice and boosters. Just a bit uncomfortable as there are no areas with benches and tables to sit and enjoy one's choice but it's worth a visit and "a taste"! It may be VERY crowded at lunch time, specially on Fridays and Saturdays. Absolutely recommended!||June 25, 2018
websterpaul62||50||Everything you could possibly imagine and more , amazing ingredients or food to go from all over the world , totally spoiled for choice , don't eat before you visit !||June 25, 2018
karenrD5278OZ||50||We had just hopped off the plane from the USA, and headed for Borough Market for some local cuisine for lunch! The market was so busy! So much to look at and so many options for all! I would suggest bringing cash because lots of places do not take credit cards. Great way to get a TASTE of London on the first day of our trip!||June 24, 2018
Martin2206||50||This place is awesome with wonderful aromas from the vast variety of produce on sale. Drink, food, spices, samples, etc are all here.Best if you can visit mid morning as the crowds start rolling in for lunch and it’s heaving.I generally visit every time I’m in London; so why wait any longer come along and enjoy I’m sure you’ll not be disappointed.||June 24, 2018
Sean_Brannigan_87||40||Great place with many options for food. Fresh products from all over the world.Really enjoyed the African food.||June 24, 2018
justineb983||50||So much to see and do here! There is something for everyone, flowers, coffee, alcohol and endless ranges of food, Borough Market is a must do in London. ||June 24, 2018
hleo1||50||The market was packed with people from all over the world. There were many food vendors selling great yummy foods from burgers to asian foods and doughnuts. I'll definitely come again for all our London trips. Fantastic place to eat as long as you dont mind the crowds and lines to queue. Especially love the grilled cheese toastie.||June 23, 2018
Ooty a||50||I came with a friend and my daughter who has celiac. The variety of gluten free food is amazing!!! I enjoyed it so much. This place has such great vibe!! Lovely walk around and you can buy some nice food and walk around the park or rest there. Just lovely time. Highly recommend.||June 23, 2018
103marianas||50||If you want to taste different foods, drinks or buy something to eat this is the place. A bit overcrowded for me. But nevertheless it is an interesting check point.||June 23, 2018
Jamie O||50||Walk over London Bridge from the city. Pass the cathedral on the right, and you find yourself at the entrance to Borough Market. We ate here the first day after visiting the Old Operating Theatre. We loved it so much we came back two more times. Borough Market offers you a wonderful place to grab a tasty and inexpensive meal. You have choices ranging from Scotch eggs, Thai food, meat pies, fish and chips, oysters, German sausages, sandwiches, and more. There are also myriad stalls offering cheeses, sausages, fresh fruit and vegetables, fruit drinks, jellies, spices...you name it. It is busy and crowded. I would recommend keeping an eye on your purse or day pack as I would imagine this could be a great place for pickpocketing. There is a very small seating area (which also has toilets) to the left of the underpass entrance, so we mostly stood up to eat. Whether you want to graze your way through lunch or pick up some delicious olives or strawberries, Borough Market is your place!||June 23, 2018
Matto8750||50||Was convinced to go here for breakfast, let me say I was not disappointed. Had bubble and squeak at Mari’s cafe......lovely!! This place is like one big Deli it’s brilliant. If your around this area in London then go it’s great! ||June 23, 2018
C9776EHmikek||40||Lots of different stalls, good prices and great variaty. Seafood , meats , cheese and more. Not many placea to sit down but still nice||June 23, 2018
David N||50||I like visiting this peace of art in middle of city, where can I visit so many cousines. TIpical for London.... conect with so many nationality :)||June 23, 2018
porkypaz||40||I come here every so often for a pint (three times a day) and it’s great and all that kinda stuff. I can’t remember much of the stuff I get up to - as I sometimes drink from 10am and all that kinda stuff, usually with my mate Alan before trying to sack him again. It’s always a great place to have my monthly cigarette for health purposes. Sometimes I come with old loaf face. It’s well worth a visit and all that! ||June 23, 2018
homesteads||50||It was really buzzing with locals and tourists alike. It seems to have more to see (and eat) at every visit. The food is incredible, you can get anything you want here. It is all fresh and reasonably priced. All the licensed premises were touting the new fads of Pink Gins and Pink Prosecco. Well I had to try them!!!!! A great way to spend time when in London. Well worth a visit and most of the stalls we were at had a top 5 star rating for cleanliness.||June 22, 2018
EdwardN731||50||This is a must visit if you're in London. It's the essence of British culture with fresh food and vegetables. Try the fresh oyster and freshly baked donuts. Figs sold here are rarely found in chains like Sainsbury or Tesco.||June 21, 2018
FellowTraveler79945||50||Borough Market was amazing! Wish we would have spent more time here. It is a foodie’s paradise. Don’t miss this if in London!||June 21, 2018
F1resign||50||As a former chef, I must say I'm partial to food destinations. If I lived here I'd be there every weekend. And I thought we had good markets in the bay area. You can really feel what it would have been like hundreds of years ago. There is every kind of food imaginable, the vendors go on forever. After you've eaten/shopped your way through you an take a walk along the Thames or over London Bridge to your next destination. I highly recommend the experience. Also is extremely easily reached by public transportation.||June 20, 2018
sightingsarah||50||There is so much good food in this market. Scallops with the veggie stir fry and the fish and chips places are the best.||June 20, 2018
aeta2014||50||Anything you can imagine when it comes to food - they will have. Amazing chese, fruits, veggies, sweets, ready foods...always a pleasure to buy a few different bites in-between sightseeing in central london. Much better than restaurants, love comming back to this gem.||June 20, 2018
Les46||50||This is a must for anyone in London. Go hungry as you won’t be for long. If you want to try a few things then I suggest you look to share as portions are really big!||June 20, 2018
Longman1950||30||and there are more people (tourists) taking pictures than buying the food, which is a pity because most of it is pretty good food to take home...buck the trend||June 20, 2018
Chad C||50||When I first stepped into Borough Market, my eyes just about popped out of my head! The sights, smells and sounds were amazing to say the least. If you're looking for food treats from all over the world, you've found it here. Everything I tried was absolutely delicious. If you love food, this is a must stop if you're staying in London.||June 19, 2018
LiLing601||40||Lots of different cruisine. I love the Singapore Laksa very much. Vege and fruits selling there are super fresh and reasonable price. The only issue there is limited table/chair for dining. You can pack ur pack and dine at bar by ordering their beers.||June 19, 2018
seanght||40||A real flavour of London. Fantastic stalls, pubs and restaurants abound. Well worth a visit despite the crowds. It's a great part of London with loads of historical sights to see - well worth a visit.||June 19, 2018
JES1London||50||I use Borough Market a lot both to buy & as a cut through to work. It is a place for excellent fresh fruit & veg & gorgeous bread & cheeses! So what is not to like !It is very busy at the end of the week but the atmosphere is great- you can eat & drink there too.||June 18, 2018
AndyTaylor82||50||One of my favourite places in London, always a good atmosphere, great smells, delicious food and time for a couple of beers! ||June 18, 2018
TimothyF5||50||Foodie heaven! The Borough market comprises of permanent seller's stalls, and temporary stalls selling mainly food - everything from raw ingredients, to ready cooked street food - in all of its various guises. The market also has a few restaurants, pubs and coffee shops - although they can be busy on a typical Saturday morning. Be aware that the market is not open on Sundays, and Saturdays are the best days to visit if you want to experience the full range of foods sold - as there are more of the temporary stalls open on Saturdays. It is a little expensive if comparing to other more traditional markets, however everything on offer is of the highest standards. The fruit and vegetable sellers for example have some of the best French produce, wild mushrooms, and weird and wonderful veg I have never seen before or tasted. There are at least 4 bread sellers, each offering their own unique approach to artisan baking. There are cheese sellers and cheese makers, spice sellers, wine merchants, butchers, juice bars, oil sellers, tea merchants, coffee merchants and loads of street food. One of our favourites is Kappacasein's incredible cheese and onion toasty - which is worth queuing up for, and worth the £7 (yes £7 for a toasted cheese sandwich, but trust me you will have no buyer's remorse).For coffee drinkers who like to buy ground coffe or beans for grinding, Monmouth Coffee is worth a visit, with no fewer than a dozen different coffee beans available, and they will brew as many samples from their bean selection as you want. I great place to try out some fine coffee, and take some home. They'll even make a cup for you to take-away of the beans you have just bought, and they will either prepare in an Espresso fashion (Americano, Cuppucino Latte, etc) or drip brew it. A good place for aspiring chefs and foodies to source special ingredients to make a meal extra special meal - think truffles, pink garlic, game, the finest oils, the finest hams and cheeses, etc. etc. For me, as a reasonably regular visitor, I don't think it will ever bore me.Top Tip: Arrive early, as it gets really crowded around lunchtime.||June 18, 2018
alwtrm2016||40||I always like going to Borough Market, but be warned it is expensive and on a Saturday very very crowded. My advice is to go on a Thursday when market is open but less frantic with visitors. Some of the street food stalls are open all week catering for the many people who work in the area. The Market Porter pub is worth a visit and the Hope and Anchor around the corner. Worth a trip for sure.||June 18, 2018
AUSTLON||50||After the incidents that happened here I was not sure if this would affected the vibe. How wrong was I. The vibe the food and drinks are world class. Borough market is one of my favourite areas in London. Look forward to returning many times more||June 18, 2018
LordOrk||50||Borough Market is a must if you are a foodie & has developed into a global foodie heaven. Best to go hungry to enjoy sampling the wonderful selection of street food. It’s colourful & vibrant but does get very busy. Not quite the Boccaria in Barcelona but well worth visiting.||June 18, 2018
strippier||50||Wandered to the market for a late breakfast/brunch. Once you've taken in the sights of the bakers/pattiseries, fruit stalls, cheese mongers and head for the hot street food stalls... they are a global phenomenon. A must visit!! ||June 18, 2018
aureliaowner||50||Borough was a fruit and vegetable market for the trade until it allowed us in about twenty five years ago, initially just one Saturday per month. Since then, it has become a destination for foodies offering a wide selection of foods form all over the world. Inevitably there have been some losses, such as the vegetable dealer Booths, but others have become firm favourites, such as Mrs Kings Pork Pies (the best in the universe, say I!) and Sussex Fish sold from the stall by Paul, who owns part of the day boat that catches them, so these are the freshest fish in London.But Boro is a victim of its own success. As a tourist destination, it is selling less fresh food to process and cook - tourists do not cook unless they rent apartments, but many of the primary suppliers now provide ready to eat meals, and very good they are too. So, go now, buy, before it folds as a food market!||June 18, 2018
Kimmybear2013||40||Been going for years. The best thing is the food. Food from all over the world, especially Spanish. There are little eateries too around the market and these serve decent food too. Highly recommended||June 18, 2018
Tom M||40||Amazing food of a wide variety of cuisine. Very London! Try the coffee from the stall supporting London’s homeless, it’s to die for! ||June 18, 2018
Nataliya F||50||We came here for a quick lunch grab after visiting the Tower of London, and ended up coming again to try different varieties of foods. The abundance of variety is amazing and everything we have tried is freshly prepared! Fruits are out of this world! If you just want to browse the market, then half an hour or an hour is plenty. If you do want to try the food, be prepared to eat in a crowed place with limited sitting available. But, believe me - it is totally worth it!||June 18, 2018
MJH1||30||Called in this Sunday whilst exploring south bank with the kidsHad to queue for ages through security (which I get)But then very busy once in - not ideal with young kids - perhaps we should get there earlier next time Spent longer to get in than we actually spent in there||June 18, 2018
timeN8422WK||50||Something for everyone! My family wanted to browse and I was able to sneak in a pint while they were shopping.||June 18, 2018
DawnV238||40||When I visit my daughter in London we try and fit in a visit to the market, this weekend I bought some spices and flavourings and then we had an ENORMOUS salt beef sandwich for lunch which was deliciously ||June 17, 2018
Katie M||50||We went here just for a look, ended up buying macaroons and fudge. Was really interesting and there are loads of free samples to try to see if you like it. Early grey macaroons and passion fruit macaroons. Black liquorice fudge, salted Carmel fudge, white chocolate fudge and chili chocolate fudge. Delicious!||June 17, 2018
giuliano2000||50||We spent two hours at the Borough market, half of whom we dedicated to explore all the stands and decide which food nationality we would like to taste. Great food, good prices, and even if a bit touristy, totally worth it!! I would suggest it to anybody who likes to experience, enter in the London atmosphere, and have a walk in the zone of the City, and the Tate modern!! Perfect for lunch, but watch out:it’s closed for dinner!!||June 17, 2018
Jezzmond||50||Great place to visit with a lively vibe. So many different foods to try and cheese . Highly recommended ||June 17, 2018
William B||20||We, like everyone else, habe seen the gushing YouTube videos of Borough Market and thought we'd go and have a look.It was really busy, some pushing and shoving going on. It's also extremely hot.There isn't enough seating either.The food was, I am afraid, rather ordinary and it was obvious that some food people had more than one stall. For example there were half a dozen 'bakers' selling exactly the same stuff.You can probably do better as a village show, and it would be a very great deal cheaper...||June 16, 2018
ChrissieWilliams81||40||I'd always wanted to visit this market and finally got around to it this winter. Loads of different options for food on the go, or fresh fruits, vegetables and meats to take home.I recommend the bratwurst, but I could have chosen many other options too.||June 16, 2018
U4876GGbena||40||We visited Borough Market for lunch today, and were very pleased that we did! The market has a vast variety of foods available. There was a great amount of gluten free products, and although there was great deal of on trend foods there was still a traditional deal to the market.||June 15, 2018
mmajohnson||50||We stopped at Borough Market for lunch one day and I am so happy we did! Stalls upon stalls of all sorts of food - fruit, vegetables, sweets, etc. We particularly like the cheeses! Best was the food trucks that line the outer perimeter. There is truly something for everyone to eat! Stop at Borough if you can - you will be happy you did.||June 14, 2018
Beddington210||50||Nice walk through all the shops etc - great for a light meal or drink. Near London Bridge mainline & tube stations.||June 14, 2018
M3427FIwilliams||40||This place was great. It is large and a bit confusing to navigate but it has every kind of food (and drink) imaginable. My family tried 4 different food items and all were tasty. It is difficult to find a place to sit down and eat. We also went to one of the several coffee shops which was crowded but enjoyable. I even got a hair cut. Recommend.||June 13, 2018
Karen E||50||Wonderful experience of browsing and sampling some delicious tastes After much decision of so much smells to tempt me I went with the paella with prawns and squid, asked for half and half The taste was great The only problem is you need money/ card because of a fantastic supply of all foods and fancies Never bored of Borough market||June 13, 2018
Robert P||40||A good way to try different foods in London. Bring some cash, not all the business accept Cards. Just remember the parking in that area, are not free and not necessarily easy to find unless it's a bank holiday.||June 13, 2018
jan1608||50||never been to a leon before. Veggie food excellent. Watched staff meticulously clean every tray, so when food did fall on to tray, safe to eat. How often does that happen?????would certainly eat there again when next in london. big 'thumbs up'||June 13, 2018
918louisev||40||It is a trendy food market with lots of produce arranged into cheese, meat, fresh fruit/veg and fish. In my opinion though it is not very organised and always very crowded. There's a huge range of stalls and samples to try but a bit disorienting for me. Be prepared and expect queues at the most popular food stalls. There is a distinct lack of places to stand and eat having bought the food. If you're going in winter, then best to wrap up as it can get cold standing around. As a vegetarian I find the sight and smell of so much meat overwhelming and unpleasant but I am the exception to the rule. It is a foodie's heaven I imagine and extremely popular!||June 13, 2018
flurrywitten||50||Have been to Borough Market so many times and it NEVER fails to disappoint. Great food, atmosphere and everything about it!!!!Have been in the day and evening.....LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Borough :-)Is perfect for couples, friends and families alike||June 13, 2018
PJBolivar||50||This is a must when in London. Heaven for food enthusiasts. Everything you can think of. The fresh cheeses, seafood and breads are great. Highly recommend a visit. ||June 12, 2018
Navigator779539||50||Visited here not long after the unfortunate attack. Got to say it’s a absolute gem. The varied choice on offer is amazing. It’s not too big but not small either and every inch is filled with a different stall. I had the seafood paella, bratwurst, coffee, brownie and carrot cake. There was so much more but my waistline wouldn’t accept it haha. Visit this place, you will not be disappointed.||June 12, 2018
MonicaC5478||50||Walking along the BANKSIDE, when you get to LONDON BRIDGE, turn to the right and after 5 minute walk you will find this great market, where you can eat finger food, have drinks, do shopping and get the strangest and unusual food products. My favorite, great variety of curries, spices and related products in SPICE MOUNTAIN, UNIQUE SHOP!!During the last three years I have been to THE UK, this market is one of my priorities! I have recommended to all my friends and acquaintances and everybody agreed. Before going, check opening and closing timetable- they may vary according to day. But please, DON'T MISS IT!!!!||June 12, 2018
leanne m||30||We walked by and thought we should look inside but there was nothing open just before midday on a Sunday. There were signs to "toilets" but following those signs led nowhere. There didn't seem to be any public facilities in the area, even at the nearby London Bridge station. If you do visit here be prepared first!||June 11, 2018
Slow-travel||40||We stayed in Southwark on our recent trip to London and absolutely loved the market for breakfast and lunch. The coffee is excellent, and there are many ethnic food cards from which to choose. There is also a large covered area so you can sit down to eat.||June 11, 2018
abaitinger||50||A great place to visit mid morning and lunch time. Many great and reasonable places to have lunch. Large variety of food and drink. We ate at the Argentina cafe, very good. Also a good place to shop for various food goods including fruits and veggies. ||June 11, 2018
Cheryl729||50||The Borough Market is a good place to taste different food. We visited there in early June 2018. We had some raw fresh oysters, taste very good, and the price is reasonable. There are many different variety of food there. Also, many kinds of cheese, spices, meat and fresh fruit. You should go.||June 11, 2018

wcb79||50||The market is a great place to grab a quick bite. They've got a variety of different cuisines there and there's also plenty of drinks. If you want there's also a number of stalls where you can buy produce, baked goods, seafood, cheese and meats so you can prepare your own meals.||June 10, 2018
WittsyBittsy||50||You need to go. Give yourself no less than 4hours to be there, take cash card to get a bunch of different foods, and go with a group so that you all can try a bunch of different awesome foods!||June 10, 2018
J9760PKjohnm||40||Nice venue and lots of obscure products at reasonable prices. All vendors seem very friendly and helpful with good product knowledge. Overall a good place to visit if a little busy on the Saturday morning we visited. Would definitely recommend a visit.||June 10, 2018
jantee12||50||Excellent visit again, lots of food stalls, nothing to disappoint, had the curry just by the entrance, hubby had the paella, huge big pans cooking away, can recommend both, feast for the eyes, with lots of gourmet food for sale to take home. Amazing to see what you can get there, and cant wait to revisit soon again. A truly London atmosphere you cant get anywhere else.||June 9, 2018
Leilei_Victoria||50||I wish I had discovered this market during my previous trips to London. The busy market was filled with pleasant displays of fresh fruits and vegetables, small eateries, and happy visitors. Prices were reasonable and the food was authentic from various vendors.||June 9, 2018
ericm823||40||A neat place under the tracks above to buy a lunch or some real English food! So many vendors, bakers, fruit, fish etc. Definitely worth a visit to see the hustle and bustle. Try not to go during lunch hour during the week as it tends to be a bit more crowded as the surrounding workers come here for lunches. ||June 9, 2018
ceetom1||40||Lots of places to eat around here. Should not have a problem finding something you like. Keep in mind though that most places close early evening so need to visit during the daytime. Convenient to the Thames River walk.||June 8, 2018
AngieJune||40||It's a great place where all kind of cuisines/nationalities work together in a typical London kind of market. There's so much choice of food I am sure anyone can find something that will suit their taste and diet. It's also very good value usually. However, you have to like being surrounded by strangers: it's overcrowded !||June 8, 2018
magsrich||50||loved the sights sounds and smells and wished we had longer to linger. Bought some great food, and really enjoyed the atmosphere. Easy to get to||June 7, 2018
Nifty51||30||We visited midweek and it was extremely crowded. Great if you are a foodie as there are lots of food stalls selling meats, cheeses, breads, seafood, etc. And one side has a lot of prepared food to take away and eat. There is very limited seating which you will have to hunt for. Most likely you will eat standing if you buy food. I was impressed with the variety but prices were high. I would visit if in the area but not sure I would make a special trip to visit.||June 7, 2018
Persephone_Sussex||50||This is one of my favourite places to get lunch in London - so much to choose from! As well as the hot savouries (particularly like the scotch egg and roast hog stalls), there's also some amazing bakeries and coffee stalls. It's really good if you are looking for a casual lunch for a small group with different tastes too. The only downside is very limited seating.||June 6, 2018
Annette M||50||After a 10 hour plane ride, I arrived in London craving some good food. I found the right place to go - Borough Market!! This market has been here hundreds of years. It is both a market and a gourmet food court. You can shop for later or you can get hot food for immediate consumption. The choices are international - Egyptian, Moroccan, French, English, etc. etc. Expect crowds, expect lines. Once you taste the food, you will understand why. Before you make your choice, walk around the market portion. There are lots of free samples to whet your appetite. ||June 5, 2018
teomaneris||40||Various food stands from different nationalities, with opportunities to buy and consume locally, particularly cheeses, fruits, meats||June 5, 2018
U4046FUdebbiem||50||We had an hour to kill before visiting the Shard so decided to pop into Borough market! It was about 12 noon and the place was heaving!!! So many people queuing for food at every stall but the atmosphere and aromas were amazing! We decided that we needed to revisit when it was quieter and so got there for 8am on Saturday and we were not disappointed!!There were a few early birds like us but it definitely is the right time to go! We were treated to tasters at numerous stalls and had the pleasure of watching a lot of the food being cooked ready for lunchtime! There were plenty of places to eat at that time in the morning but obviously lots of the stalls would not have food ready that early!The variety of foods and produce is amazing, fresh fish, meat, fruit, veg, preserves, Spanish, French, Austrian, Greek ..... you name it you can probably buy it!!!! It’s a foodies heaven!!!! We spent over an hour just browsing (and shopping) but regretfully had to leave to catch our train home!We will definitely be making a return visit but give ourselves longer next time! ||June 5, 2018
s0lil0quet||40||Love it here. I can get what I want to eat and boyfriend can get what he wants - we are always trying new things!! Love this place, it’s become ritual every fortnight. We don’t always choose we’ll, but that’s part of the fun!||June 4, 2018
140fionag||50||Its definitely worth a visit here. Lots of eating and drinking stalls as well as ones selling produce. Some do samples.of what they are selling.Wee bit more expensive but that's London prices for you.||June 3, 2018
Drsam1||40||I went to this place on a walking tour and it was really amazing. Unfortunately when I went , I was a bit late and shops /carts were closing and going.But still I managed to get some chocolate brownie which was really good and to be honest better than some high cost stores. You can get 3 pieces at like 5 pounds if I can remember correctly. It’s also a great place to buy groceries, cheese of different kinds as well. You should go there atleast once if u are in London. In London , you don’t see a lot of places where gentrification hasn’t happened yet and yet this is a place where it has started but hasn’t progressed that much. So you should definitely have a check around the place. You will also see an old pirate ship nearby. Ps- Try sampling different things. I wasn’t successful in finding a lot of food things to sample. ||June 3, 2018
horizons1200||50||The food options are amazing, and there’s definitely something for everyone. We had fantastic Ethiopian food, which was well worth waiting in line for. Come here with an empty stomach so you can sample all of the cheeses before eating your actual meal! ||June 3, 2018
Apamperedtraveler||50||What a fun foodie experience! We visited on a Saturday afternoon and enjoyed many a sample! There are plenty of stalls to choose from but few places to sit down and eat. The crowds are expected on a Saturday but the vendors all seem ready. I saw Ethiopian food to oysters to goat ice cream to yummy breads and cheeses. Above the Roast on the Go is an expensive restaurant called the Roast, it is ok but the view of the market is the best from up here! If you go away hungry I do not know if we can be friends.||June 2, 2018
David W||40||Go to the market hungry. There are so many great things to taste and snack on from a duck confit sandwich to delicious deli meats to fresh seafood and more. Also have a drink or two and keep trying different things. As for logistics, the market is a 5min walk from a tube stop and most of it is covered which came in handy when we visited given that there was a light rain.||June 2, 2018
honestdoug1||50||We went to just see all the stalls and food it was just so good so much choice with lots of people but so easy to get to if you go early it's best as when we were leaving at 1.30 it got so over crowed||June 2, 2018
Bobbyfarrell||50||Visited the Market on a Friday Afternoon, it is a very vibrant Market, well worth a visit.Loads of street food and drink available.Need to walk round first before eating, as soon as you have something to eat you’ll find something else you wanted.Definitely returning.||June 1, 2018
Feather_Red||50||We had a wander around Borough Market on a warm Thursday afternoon and we were very impressed by the choice of food and drink on offer! Unfortunately we had already eaten lunch before we got there so we just treated ourselves to a dessert from Ion Patisserie - I had the tiramisu cheesecake and it was unbelievable!! I would go back just to eat from there again! We then had a couple of drinks at the Cider House which had a great selection of ciders ranging from a lovely light elderflower one for me to a hearty and very strong dry one for him! We also tried some excellent nut butters from a stall called Butter Nut but unfortunately realised we wouldn't be able to buy any to bring home as we were flying and only had hand luggage! I would definitely recommend going hungry (and thirsty!) as there was an incredible amount of choice and something for every palate!||June 1, 2018
petersH3019QV||30||A standard tourist trap. Some interesting stalls....but most selling the usual farmers market food stuffs. Highlight for our visit was one of the fresh oyster bars...£5:00 for 6 which was good value. I would return but probably just for the oysters and not much else.||May 31, 2018
sandmanz||50||Came to this market after a lot of people recommended it to us, and we weren't disappointed. So many options, that I'd have to stay a few days before I could have tried everything I wanted to. There are foods from all.over the world. They have veggies, meats, cheese, drinks etc. You name it, they got it. The atmosphere was very eclectic, everyone was enjoying this lovely market. ||May 31, 2018
inged59||40||Wonderful fresh fruit and vege, fish, bread, cheese you name it fabulous. Great pasta as well. Had some lovely food from the stalls.||May 30, 2018
stingytownman||50||Visited the market for lunch before going up the shard. Absolutely loved the place with its many stalls of ethic food all looking so delicious it was almost impossible to decide what to eat. In addition to the hot and cold food on offer it was a market for fruit, veg, meat, fish, cheese, wine and any other fresh food sensation you could wish for. We eventually settled on the shellfish paella we had seen on the way in that was a few quid for a delicious plate full. Well worth the visit if you get the chance. ||May 30, 2018
jobnd||50||Borough Market is a foodie market. We try to get there every time we are in London and stop at our favourite stalls. The ones that come to mind are Greenfield Fam Organic Life Teas and Bread Ahead (specifically for the jelly Doughnuts - I love Jelly Doughnuts and look for them everywhere we go, and with the possible exception of the ones you can find at the Granville St. Market in Vancouver Canada, these are the best I have found!). Also check out the Richard Bramble stall selling whimsical dishes and cards - I bought a mussel bowl which I love to bring out when, well, we are having mussels! If you are in a hotel perhaps just pick up lunch at one of the outdoor stalls and some sweets for the theatre, and if you have rented an apartment, then go there first to forage for fruit, veg cheese and anything else that takes your fancy. Yes it is possible that the prices may be a bit higher than Tesco but the freshness and the choices more than make up for it. Or if you prefer a sit down lunch there are many good restaurants in the area. If you have a few extra minutes pop next door to see Southwark Cathedral - a pretty church and lovely and quiet. When we were there the organist was practicing so we were able to sit and enjoy a recital of sorts which just added to the day.||May 30, 2018
Colleen H||50||Dropped into this market on the way to the East last Friday morning. It was bustling and chock full of some of the best foodie stalls e.g. baked goods, hot foods, fresh fruit and veg, jams, cheese, fudge etc. Forget Fortnum and Mason. The produce is fresh and better priced and every stall holder was keen to provide a generous sampling of their goods. We bought liquorice fudge, chocolate truffles, jam and a couple of punnets of raspberries and blackberries. If we had room we would have bought the beef dripping hot chips with rosemary. Yummo.||May 30, 2018
867ians||50||Tremendous range of foods on sale for immediate consumption or to take home. Wonderful selection of cheeses, butchery,fish, wines and spices.Could easily spend a fortune here! Great experience though!Found lots of little Christmas gifts too!||May 30, 2018
896mickw||40||If you go to London then this place is a must so many food stalls and so much choice,My wife and myself visited the Gourmet Goat ( see pic) and had the Goat wrap and slow roast Veal wrap and they were amazing well worth a try.||May 29, 2018
mgaax||50||Young fun place to visit. Lots of little eateries. We ate at Wright Brothers. Difficult to find but oh my, food fantastic. Staff made the dinner so much fun. You watch your dinner being made! Great evening and area. ||May 29, 2018

Y6198XDpaulh||30||50 years ago I was a young police officer here. Then this was a working fruit and veg market. After all this time I wanted to see how it was altered. The wholesale market has gone but the original buildings are still here. Now there are little stalls doing food and craftwork. Sadly, despite it being a bank holiday, nothing was open but was worth a visit to see the old buildings ||May 28, 2018
Nathalie H||20||We asked for Cesar Salad. One of us has made it loads of times in her work life. It lacked anchovies, the cheese was cheddar and not Parmesan. Therefore it was mis-advertised. The staff were askance when we asked them to hurry up as we had been waiting for ages. However the girl at the bar and the waiter were quick to help and well mannered.||May 28, 2018
travellilworm||50||Love this market! My favourite in London. However, I don’t advise going on a Saturday. Go during the week. You will see mainly tourists but it’s easier if you want to go shopping something specific! And the products are amazing! ||May 28, 2018
heatherhK1017OG||20||Went Bank holiday weekend it was very busy and not a pleasant experience plenty of choice of food when you could see the stalls. Probably better going midweek might be less busy||May 28, 2018
PJay2412||50||awesome markets, definitely worth a visit. The only downside is that a lot of other people think so too. Can be crowded , but the food vendors, the produce; and just amazing.||May 27, 2018
AussiesBallarat||50||As tourists, visiting the Borough Market presents great challenges - rarely is one able to taste the many tempting foods on display, and without the impact of food-law red tape to block the view. Sometimes it is necessary to make do with just a free sample, and then dream the "if only". It is worth walking to the back of the market, to Stoney Street, to see the great piece of street art created on the wall under the railway bridge, in memory of last year's terrorist attack. It is a sobering reminder of recent events in this area. Then have a drink at Monmouth Coffee, queue permitting.||May 27, 2018
c-racer-2000||30||The Borough’s Market is a interesting place to visit. They have places to eat and places to buy produce too. We are here twice but the problem here is there is no place to sit and eat. You end up standing up eating. Not very good. Yes, there are tables and chairs but not anywhere near enough. We bought some nice fresh strawberries here too. There are all kinds of places to choose from. I recommend visiting here. ||May 27, 2018
strawjames7||50||Visited last Tuesday afternoon, it was fascinating marketplace. We enjoyed our visit as there were varieties of selection of street foods, pub and restaurant..a must visit place if you are in London. Do not miss it and i bet you enjoy a lot particularly in sunny summer afternoon...the downside is it closes little early in the evening.||May 27, 2018
Beanie257||50||Visited this week and off I wish there were markets like this up and down the country. Quality of the produce was spot on and the selection was impressive.Great atmosphere and vibe running through the whole place. ||May 26, 2018
djw1955||50||Really enjoyed my morning visit to Borough Market, taking in the different foods, vegetables and other products that the Market offer. Very friendly atmosphere and the produce and foods on sale were great, just wish I lived nearby to visit daily. Really worth a visit and see the produce available and I sure enjoyed the Oyster with a little lemon also available in the market.Great Place.||May 26, 2018
221hennypenny||40||Busy market place selling various foods from around the world. Good place for food on the go. Cheeses, sweets, coffees, teas, burgers, street foods etc.||May 25, 2018
Alan S||40||Borough Market is a large area with food kiosks galore.Come hungry and adventurous. Pasta, meat, cheeses, wine, desserts, and much more.Enjoy!||May 25, 2018
kwagmeister||50||This historic market has a small role in Harry Potter — in one of the movies Harry looks out of his window and the camera pans the market below — this market. It’s a fabulous place. Foods from everywhere are here and ready for consumption. Fresh produce, wines, flowers, spices, meats — holy cow it is a foodie’s dream come true. Sit at one of the restaurants and watch the people go by. It’s a great way to spend n hour or so. If I lived here this would be a regular hangout. It’s never the same place from week to week as produce changes with the seasons, and according to our guide new food stalls come and go with the seasons, too. WOW.Worth even a walk through!||May 25, 2018
W1797ILjackied||40||A great place just to wander around and sit and eat and drink. Lots of true London atmosphere. Be aware that the market is closed on a Sunday. ||May 23, 2018
959brianh||50||We came here for breakfast one morning and were overwhelmed by the amount of food vendors selling really good looking food. I had a bap and a Turkish coffee and both were incredible. It was also very cool to walk around. I highly recommend visiting.||May 23, 2018
Linda L||50||This place is amazing! Every kind of cheeses, olive oils, smoke meats, seafood, fresh veggies. If you have time this is a must see. I was in heaven. ||May 23, 2018
th0masellam||50||I wish I had something like this on my door step. My personal highlights where the ginger pig butcher and the cannon and cannon British chacutery. The oysters and sea urchin place is also worth a mention along with Neil's yard for cheese just round the corner. Simply put this place is amazing and I will definatley visit every time I visit london||May 22, 2018
535mageds||40||it is a big market , you can find so many things to buy specially food , you can taste from all kitchens all over the world .||May 22, 2018
SerCh11||50||The place is easy to reach by metro, at London bridge and within a short walk. I was there around 10am and there are not many people there. The oysters are very fresh, we bought some bottles of truffles, some nice ceramic plates, had delicious burger, wine and also bangers and mash. I would definitely go again when I am next in London.||May 22, 2018
agnesck||40||This is not a place to dine being seated but the produce was fresh and I like taking a walk there then stopped for two oysters ha||May 22, 2018
Laurel G||50||I recently had a long layover at LHR and decided to take in the sites instead of sit in the airport. I almost didn’t go to the borough market due to the walking distance but am so glad I did. Go hungry! Fish and chips were delicious. Lots of artisanal items. ||May 21, 2018
DMVEAL||50||Never been before but will be back. We decided on an impromptu picnic so went and got bread cheese pate and strawberries from here. Different suppliers but all I can say is it was scrummy. Will go back if in the area. Suppliers are from all over U.K. and many different pop up food places from across the world ... A must if you want an experience ||May 21, 2018
John H||50||Visit this market with an empty stomach and leave happy! So many great food vendors - we had a pork belly and cracklin sandwich from Roast To Go, and also ate falafel, a scotch egg, and Spanish ham and cheese. Just walk around a bit and you will find something you like!||May 20, 2018
veronicajepsen85||50||Great vibe Great food. Great products. It is one of the best markets in the world. You should visit this place if you are in London. Very short walk to London bridge and Tower bridge .||May 20, 2018
jomuckle66||50||So many stalks most offered a small taster. Just wondering round taking in the colours and aroma is interesting. Prices are reasonable and stall holders friendly.Coffee shops and pub also available ||May 20, 2018
Bryan C||50||We visited on a Monday and was still full of vendors and food to enjoy. Do not miss!! So good for lunch and so many different types of foods to enjoy.||May 18, 2018
JayneH718||50||We absolutely love this market. The food choices are plentiful. Everything we tasted was delicious. I highly recommend the chorizo sandwich at Brindisa Grill, cheeses and olives, prosecco spritzer, and for dessert-a caramel sea salt doughnut with a honeycomb. Taste testing flavored honeys before purchasing was sweet. It was a great first day lunch in London. For your planning, the market is closed on Sundays.||May 17, 2018
997vickyh||50||We were out walking around near London bridge and happened on this market by chance. It was awesome. Cheese, wine, baked goods, nuts, olives, meats, vegetable/fruits. Just so much to see—and taste. Vendors were really nice and helpful. Bring a shopping bag for what you buy! And an empty stomach. ||May 17, 2018
Sussi G||40||I only ran thru the market. But it was a lot of things to eat. Looked nice and price worth. Free wi-fi also||May 16, 2018
allenfromsf||40||We stopped by Borough Market on a Monday around noon and there was still plenty of things to see and eat even though it was a "Limited Market" day. If you're a foodie, then this is a must-visit in London.||May 16, 2018
Gwynneth H||40||Loved having a look round the market. Some of the prices were high but things were fresh, colourful and beautifully presented. Take an hour and have a gander round the market.||May 16, 2018
craigmacleod8||50||The smells captivate you, from-entering the market from any direction, you are consumed by the multitude of aromas and colors of all the produce. Take time to taste as much as you can, a truly amazing place, highly recommended for a visit.||May 16, 2018
Oldstayer||50||One of the most compresive markets I have ever seen. The traders are of every consevable country and are helpful to all customers.Prices are variable but reasonable. The herb stall is the best I have seen anywhere and the mushroom stall has every type of mushroom you could need .This market is the best!!||May 15, 2018
Zigett||40||What's not to love about Borough Market....well perhaps maybe the crowds on a busy weekend! But overall it's a great experience, with lots of interesting stalls selling a superb range of cheeses, charcuterie, fruit & veg, and fresh fish. Most of the stalls - especially those dedicated to all things cheese - will happily let you sample their produce. And if you like shellfish, there are a couple of very good stalls selling a range of fresh oysters which you can slip down at the stall.||May 15, 2018
Yogananthini||50||Make yourself really hungry before going here! So many variety of cheeses and interesting to see many different types of food. Enjoy walking and hunt for your favourite food!||May 14, 2018
sarahtravelled3||30||I was a little bit underwhelmed by these markets with all the hype they get. This was mainly a food market with goods to take home or eat there, I'd recommend going for lunch.Avoid Mondays, they advertise they are open but really only about 50% of the stalls are. Still worth a visit if your in the area and have spare time late in the week, but if your pushed for time, perhaps give this one a miss. ||May 14, 2018
vasilissiomos2323||50||The best place to eat,shop and drink....so many people...The Borough Market displays good old fresh English products as well as products from around the world.||May 14, 2018
Satish C||50||Loads of tiny shops, stalls and eateries close to one another under a railway line. Festive atmosphere. Wide variety of foods to try including some fab coffee. We felt a little spoilt for choice. Credit cards accepted. Highly recommended. ||May 14, 2018
Saintlysinner||40||My Boyfriend took me here for our lunch break. It was a nightmare deciding where we wanted to eat. As he has recently turned vegetarian we decided to go to a vegan stall where they do three times of interesting burgers and a salad. It was yummy. However, a word of warning... as Borough market has become somewhat of a tourist attraction prices are high, in fact some are on par as you would find in a sit down place.||May 14, 2018
Rolfies||30||Headed here to peruse the great number of stalls for lunch as we have done before but it was absolutely packed, chugged around steadily, had a fairly bland spinach and cheese pastry and wished we had visited the indian food stall instead. Nearby Southwark Cathedral look impressive. Nice to have travelled that far and seen two stalls run by local companies (well done Mountains Sausage and Teds Veg for educating the palates of our friends down south)Perhaps we're just too long in the tooth to be crammed in this type of hustle and bustle!||May 13, 2018
steve d||50||A large choice of food stalls and cafés at which to eat and drink, well worth more than one visit. Could spend several hours looking round sampling the large variety of products, difficult not to spend a fortune!||May 13, 2018
kathryno172||50||What a wonderful buzz and marvellous atmosphere. Lots of fabulous produce...fresh wild garlic and asparagus ...herbs spices, cakes, every possible variety of fast food takeouts....you must make the time to visit ...give yourself a few hours at least! ||May 13, 2018
615stuartm615||40||We came here just to look around and see what the fuss was about.Massive market with countless original stalls, plenty of food choices to eat and what a choice of things to buy!!!!Unfortunately we didn’t purchase any goods from here but we know we will next time as all looked amazing.||May 12, 2018
UweH284||40||The Borough Market displays good old fresh English products as well as products from around the world. There is plenty of cheese stalls, fishmongers and baking stalls selling fresh produce. You can purchase fresh raw ingredients, something prepared or just stroll through admiring what is on offer, with a little taste here and there. It is a short walk from the London Bridge tube station. Entrance is free. ||May 12, 2018
615traveller||30|| A bit disappointing and certainly not cheap. Better places in London to eat without going out of your way||May 11, 2018
_Rocket-Raccoon_2017||50||Borough Market is truly magnificent. A huge market with lots of ingredients and fresh food. You can buy and taste good meals as well. Lot of cool photo locations. I’d really recommend this place. A must see!! ||May 11, 2018
meryembelke||50||I like the places where you can walk around and try small things. This market is just created for that. A must visit place if you are into exotic food||May 11, 2018
hem0116||50||Open air market with very many speciality food stalls from all over the world. Lots of tasting available with food that is difficult to source elsewhere ||May 11, 2018
Meerkat_Man||50||Such an interesting market to visit, look around, buy produce or just have some food, drinks or a snack. Certainly popular and appeals to the tourists. A very cosmopolitan array of foods on display. Perhaps not the cheapest.||May 10, 2018
gabrielciuchi||50||It is a place to eat Street food from all around the world, or buy it, and cook it yourself. From meat to vegetarian, fruits, and drinks. I had some great cider, draft. ||May 9, 2018
MULCASTER2||50||its fabulous, love the little stalls selling many different and specialist foods, love to call here on an evening for a drink and on our last days for food to take back home. Never disappointed||May 9, 2018
Dannithegirll||40||We had a wonder through Borough Market as my friends and I were visiting a few museums. Its such a nice place to wonder round, there is loads to see, such a wide variety of food, there was a lovely stall that sold really nice cakes and I had a chocolate brownie. Another stall sold really nice Indian food. There are also stalls selling seafood and meat. I visited in January which I think was a good time as it wasn't too busy, but my friends visited again the other week (may) and said it was really hectic. I would like to visit again.||May 9, 2018
Dobbydobs||50||Great place, lots to see lovely fresh smelling aromas of food everywhere. Found a bar and had drinks whilst awaiting the girls midafternoon tea Groupon deal. Never been before but I loved the place. It was a baking hot day so may be different if cold or rain. Give it a go||May 9, 2018
nyotista||40||This place is amazing. So many choices of food and beverages. The atmosphere is amazing and it's perfect for foodies! When in Borough Market, please visit Monmouth Coffee for their amazing coffee and don't let the long line fools you because the staff works fast and you'll have your coffee in no time :) Borough Market is definitely a must-visit when in London!||May 8, 2018
Agnija D||50||Borough market is not just another place for sightseeing in London. It can be also a great and affordable place for lunch where everyone can find something - oysters with some sparkling wine, exotic meat burger (kangaroo, ostrich, crocodile), traditional English fish and chips are just a few options to mention.||May 8, 2018
Danuta321||50||Fresh juices, fruits, meat and delicious wrap with duck meat in the heart of London. It's within walking distance of HMS Belfast, the Tower Bridge and the London Bridge.||May 8, 2018
427viktorh||50||Amazing street food market, highly recommend! Every time we visited London, we have to come to visit Borough Market. ||May 8, 2018
Poohbear91||50||A must for any foodie in London. Lots of stalls and food stands selling a variety of different cuisines. Especially busy in spring/summer weekends so be warned of crowds and lots of people. Most recently had a burger and beef dripping chips from the farm stand in the main enclosed part and was delicious. Would recommend you take cash!||May 7, 2018
Tlsbenson||40||Been wanting to visit here for years, managed to fit it in to a 'special day out' to London - amazing range of foods from all over the world to buy and take home. Also great opportunities to dine out (standing up) with all sorts of cuisine - between us we had a tray of deep fried calamari, paella and the most gorgeous Malayan chicken curry I've ever had! Oh and treated ourselves to a glass of prosecco from the stall opposite! It was a bit on the pricey side, but very good quality, and got our day out off to a great start- very crowded but great ambience.||May 6, 2018
Cheshie||50||Love the vibe of Borough Market. There's a huge range of food available which is great as I'm veggie....but my son loves the hog roast. The seating area is a lovely break from the hustle and bustle of central London. Surprisingly clean and, although always busy, never feels chaotic.||May 6, 2018
6jennies||40||Really lovely market with plenty to see and eat. There is an abundance of fresh food stands in lots of different types of cuisines and even places for cakes and cookies and ice cream. Can’t believe we had never been even after going to London so often. Hidden Gem ||May 6, 2018
kellyrochford||30||Quite interesting, lots of food products and street food and items not seen in the general foodstores. BUT it is a tourist attraction promoted by tv chefs. Prices are through the roof, look, sample then leave. My 3star rating based on prices of produce on sale.||May 6, 2018
chrispytew||50||Went early morning to pick up breakfastSelection of cheeses and meats with some great breadFantastic selection of everything you could think ofWell recommended ||May 6, 2018
Fuz1701||50||Back up to the old smoke again! Today I decided to visit Borough Market for the first time in a couple of years.. nothing changes, for which I’m thankful as most of London is changing rapidly and not always for the better.Anyway, Borough is a place all foodies should visit, there are a interesting range of produce here to consume. Stalls of bread, assorted oils, vinegars and sauces are all available. Fresh fruit and veg occupy a good section of the area along with meats and fish. If there is a need to feast NOW!, you’ll find a great selection of stalls plying their trade... burgers to paella, cold cuts to vegetarian are all available. You could almost eat for free by the time you’ve take a sip or chew from the available samples, but this should be you goal... find something new, embellish you meals. Beyond the market you’ll find a good range of eateries, serving the area, take a break from the packed crowds to linger before reentering the fray once more! Enjoy!One last thing if you love liquorice (and I do) you will find some interesting selection here!||May 5, 2018
equinnjr56||50||Visited Hobbs Barber Shop on recent trip to London and got a great haircut from Mark, who was very friendly.Will definitely stop back on my next visit.||May 5, 2018
TrevorHall||50||If you're interested in foods from the UK and across the world, this is an absolute must-see in London. We cannot help but be drawn towards it every time we visit, filling our rucksacks with delightful foods for home. The diversity is huge and there's plenty of stands selling meals 'on the go'. Always a winner.||May 5, 2018
LaneyM88||50||Oh my!! Food is my favourite, what I like more than anything is having little bits of lots of things so somewhere like Borough market is like heaven for me!! Where else can you have ... a salted beef bagel, a bratwurst a burger and an empanada for your lunch?! Now the empanada I have not stopped talking about since I came home!! AMAZING to be honest we didn’t have anything that wasn’t nice and it was so cool to walk about and then stand about eating we’ll come here every time we go to London if we can!!||May 4, 2018
jeffr69||50||Fantastic place with a vibrant atmosphere, showcasing some of the worlds best foods and tastes....brilliant!!!||May 4, 2018
Norosk||50||This market is located under London Bridge. The access from the Tube is London Bridge station. The market offers variety of world food in stalls outside and inside as well. One can get a nice fish there. The place is a must for visitors of London.||May 2, 2018
282emmab||40||This market is a must go on a first trip to London; it has an abundance of food options and trinkets, it's clean, and it's also filled with people. Borough market definitely caters to tourists but also has some authentic stands. It's also close to London Bridge and the Flat Iron Flea Market which can be added to your market tour for a nice afternoon of browsing (and boozing if you so desire.)||May 2, 2018
nabbthis||50||I met some friends from California who thought the market was characterful and great for breakfast. They enjoyed good strong Turkish coffee and brunch from Maria's cafe. There are basic toilet facilities in the precincts of the market too.It's very close to the London Bridge underground station and easy walking along to the Golden hind and the Globe so you could start a day trip here and see quite a lot in a small area. Also close to Southwark cathedral. ||May 2, 2018
Karen M||30||We just had to experience this market on the way to site seeing in the area. Hustle and bustle galore! We did a walk around once to see everything they had to offer. We then sampled some foods from different booths. My husband was more adventurous than I was. The market was crowded, a bit littered and we spent more than we thought. All and all, another London thing to try.||April 30, 2018
simon128090||50||I had my first visit to Borough Market last Thursday morning. I arrived as the market was just opening. It wasn't too busy then. However, it was filling up by the time i left just before midday. It is a food lover's paradise. The choice of stalls is mind boggling. There's something for everyone. It's a real assault on the senses. If it wasn't for the fact that I had to catch a train I would have been there all day. A fabulous place. Highly recommended.||April 30, 2018
PJWallyrock||50||I tend to pride myself on knowing what to do when I travel. This is one where I dropped the ball. I don't mean just the market, but the entire neighborhood. We spent time at the Christmas Market, and planned on walking through the market, since we have seen hundreds of markets in other towns. However, when we turned into the first opening of this market, it all flooded me with a crazy, bustling, great smelling place to be. Like in Harrods.....but in a different way. I could have turned in any direction and found somewhere that I wanted to spend time and shop and eat and repeat. Unfortunately, it was around lunch time and I must have been the only one who didn't respect this place in my plans, since it was crowded. Since we had to get lunch and get my daughter to the bus station, we couldn't even wait to get a bite here (plus it would have taken me an hour to narrow it down to what I would have wanted to eat). Please don't underestimate this place if you like hustling and bustling marketplaces. We will be back....||April 30, 2018
darrena806||40||First time visit to the market on an off peak Monday when some of the stalls were closed. Still plenty to see and do with lots of options for street food all typically around £5 to £7 per meal.We enjoyed salt and pepper squid (£7), a vegetarian curry box (£6.50) and a salt beef sandwich (£6.50). All the food was superb. Even for an off peak day the crowds were quite heavy but not unbearable.As you walk around look for free food samples to try!Well worth a visit.||April 30, 2018
Robert R||10||Walked through the market on our way to visit the Shard. It was noisy, smelly, grubby, heaving with people not my scene at all. Might be ok if you are young. ||April 30, 2018

989ricke||50||Incredible experience for the senses - everything smells delicious and looks mouth-watering! It’s crowded and tight, but to me it only added to the experience. A huge variety of food from different countries, fresh fish, meat and produce, cheeses, desserts... Went there on our way to a show at the Globe and did not regret it. My recommendation is to go there hungry with a bunch of friends, pick a few things each, and taste it all!||April 29, 2018
DJVR1867||50||Brilliant place if you want to have street food. So much to choose from, so many different varieties. We went on a Saturday which probably is the busiest time! We had a falafel wrap and a salt beef bagel both were fabulous.||April 29, 2018
MikeChfx||50||I visited twice in one day! I was so impressed from the morning visit (and an amazing pretzel) I returned for lunch. It is very diverse, very mouthwatering and very busy. The German Deli with its Bratwurst and Frankfurters is awesome. The Cheesecake lady was amazing. The coffee okay and of course the second visit to the pretzel lady was great again. This is a super use of dead space under bridges and public infrastructure. It shows what farmers and outdoor markets should be - slightly unplanned, self-erected and not multi-million dollar mausoleums! It connects a great walk from London Bridge to Waterloo Road along the riverbank.||April 29, 2018
EMMA-VIAJAR||50||This market is special, charming, live, with good products, always crowded. You can taste many things before purchasing and to me it’s one of the best places for street food in Europe. It has been a pleasure to come back 10 years later, now with my little one, and seeing that the essence remains the same! Awesome! A place for foodies!||April 28, 2018
Ramsbottomrjr||50||What an amazing place could walk round for hours !! Went on a Saturday so was super busy would love to wonder round when slightly quieter .... if that ever happens !! Def worth a visit if ure a foodie just make sure you check out all the food before u make a decision !! ||April 28, 2018
aminaa798||50||Spent a couple of hours wandering through, trying the food and drinks. Children were mesmerised by the seafood stalls. Love the banter from the traders: very entertaining! Will be back||April 28, 2018
Davide G||50||Maybe the best, together with Camden. If the weather allows you, I also advise to eat here, you will get variety at a good price.||April 27, 2018
Anthony Van B||50||Whether you are looking for a meal, a pint, a take-away, or ingredients for your next meal at home, you can't leave this place disappointed. Fresh cooking, pubs, restsurants with table service or dozens of vendors selling anything from vegetables to meat, from appetizers to desert, from beer to wine - a food shoppers paradise.||April 27, 2018
Pamela M||40||We stumbled upon the Borough Market while walking along the waterfront area! What a great place to stop for lunch! We had the best meat pies there! I would definitely suggest this as a stop to try some of their famous pies! There were so many vendors and stands to choose from and lots of place to sit and eat!||April 27, 2018
Mana5280||50||This place was incredible. You can find just about anything here, from fine teas, to all varieties of cheeses, charcuterie, flowers....you name it. I loved the feel of the place. It’s hip, happening and so colorful. Great fish and chips too! ||April 26, 2018
kerriroseleigh||50||If you want to try the best food, fresh food, food from everywhere and anywhere, amazing creations and weird and wonderful ingredients then this is the place for you. Borough Market has a wonderful vibe - market stools, restaurants and coffee shops are never ending so if you cannot find something you like you must be crazy! You can grab great bill tong - try fresh fish - even weird ones like sea urchins if your brave enough! We have bought some lovely meats, cheeses, honey...really the list goes on. It can get extremely busy on weekends - and I do wonder why people bring their dogs here on a hot summers day because it really is not suitable! BUT on a weekday it should be fine - and is a better option if you are not so keen on crowds.||April 26, 2018
vickic16||50||We were off to visit Shakespeare’s globe theatre and came across the markets. Gosh I wish we had not eaten breakfast first. So many choices and seemingly the markets have been on that same spot for just on 1000 years! We loved it and would highly recommend anyone to visit. ||April 25, 2018
MorayLorraine||50||What a fantastic place.Great atmosphere, amazing smells and products, we ate here and the quality of the food was excellent. We bought some items to take home with us as well.Can't wait to come back again.||April 24, 2018
375jillb||50||Went through Borough Market and stopped for lunch 23/4 we decided on the Ethiopian stand, the food was so good all freshly cooked and so tasty, we have beef with rice and two veg side med portion which was plenty for £5:50 sure good value. There so many food places no matter what your taste or dietary needs you will not be disappointed we saw vegan, gluten free, vegetarian, the cheesecake stall is amazing as well, try not to go during work lunchtime as the queues are manic we went just before 12 and was served straight away.||April 24, 2018
shenizm||40||I visit a lot of markets and there are lots of options available here to eat, drink and even buy fresh meat, fish or vegetables. Some organic and some locally sourcedGreat to come to and even see everything in the area. Such a great picture opportunity too ||April 23, 2018
Wendysav||50||This is just an amazing place with an array of colourful and delicious looking foods presented so well, they are almost sculptures!We went for a little wander through after a night out and the sights are amazing. I wished we lived closer so I could buy lots of the wonderful things the market had to offer.||April 23, 2018
EADargue||40||Visited on a Saturday afternoon. This place was busy, lots of stalls selling every type of food - seafood, meat, veg, fruit etc plus lots of street food vendors with great selection of foods from all parts of the world. We bought some fab fruit and prosecco spritzers and great dairy free, gluten free cake. The layout is very chaotic and the atmosphere is bustling. Lots of tourists and shoppers. Not good for pushchairs. There were loos but quite a big queue. Great place to stop for a snack on the go or buy ingredients for a meal to cook at home.||April 23, 2018
DawnPritchard||50||If you like food then this is the place to visit. Amazing stalls selling a wonderful range of goods - Spanish food, cheeses, breads, meats, chocolates, drinks alcoholic and otherwise, fish, flowers. You can buy goodies to take home, eat/drink there or simply taste things as you walk around. Also surrounded by great bars and restaurants. Not cheap but is good quality produce and is in central London. The only downside is how crowded it gets on a Saturday afternoon when the weather is nice. Despite the crowds i really do recommend Borough market for a pleasant afternoon out||April 22, 2018
LoopyMG||50||Lovely market, great performance area too, amazing produce...if only this was my local shopping area ||April 22, 2018
Sophie3235||50||Furness Poultry and Game has a kiosk that serves venison burgers that are the very best ever! Big, juicy and full of flavour, accented with camelized onions, great cheddar cheese and a big smile. Then don’t forget a sweet or pastry. We had a wonderful banana cake but there were too many other choices to list.||April 22, 2018
TheRealGelatoGirl||40||...indeed, they have great stuff from local sources and from all around the world. From cheese to chocolate, from produce to paella, from ice-cream to almond brittle.Having said that, it is not recommended to go there on a weekend, as it is crazy full of people...||April 22, 2018
JasonJ88||30||Orgainsed chaos or a structred shambles. Take your pick.There is no doubt that this market is heavy with quality food both contemporary and street as well as old classics.....however there is an iadequatecy to fufill the basic need for both seating and toilet facilities. Does this add to the charm ? For myself....a big NOSpitalfields is a ton better both for foodies as well as for comfortiness.||April 22, 2018
We3luv2travel||50||What a fun place to go. So many yummy foods to buy. Fun to watch all the hustle and bustle of people. Well worth a visit. Near the Shakepeare Globe Theatre, so be sure to stop by when visiting that.||April 21, 2018
dupetersentravel||50||My wife and I visited Borough Market on a cold but Sunny day in early March. The stalls are so much fun to wander in and out of and the choices are varied and delicious. Favorites for us included the duck confit vendor, the variety of oysters that the sea mongers had, and the cheeses. Come hungry and enjoy walking around – we washed the food down with a stop at one of the pubs for a wonderful afternoon.||April 20, 2018
Legamania||50||Yes, yes, yes! This was a must for me while my wife & I were in London and we're glad we did. We stopped by during lunch knowing we would have a great time sampling and purchasing specialties from all of the vendors...and WE DID! Pulled pork sandwich, cheese, focaccia, fruit, sangrias, truffles. We were very happy and very stuffed when we left. Time well spent if you don't mind negotiating through crowds although it wasn't cheap overall. It adds up quick! Disappointing too because there were still so many other dishes that I wanted to try! Oh well, I guess it'll have to wait for next time we're in London which I would definitely do again. Quite the experience! Recommend you do the same.||April 20, 2018
Mansel K||50||A absolute must if you enjoy street food and if you are looking for ingredients, you are spoilt for choice, quantity and quality.||April 19, 2018
Kelly V||50||While exploring London, we happened upon Borough Market, we knew this was an area we wanted to visit, but we weren't looking for it at the time. We turned down a street, walked down some stairs and right there in front of us was the market...it was so pleasing to the senses! The sights, the noise, and let's not forget the wonderful smells! We walked around and sought out places to eat, we tried the different cheese shops, sampled some paella, and tried to figure out what we wanted for nourishment to continue our sightseeing.  We finally decided on fish and chips and a chicken wrap, everything was delicious!This was not our only visit, we went back two more times during our week in London.  Each time we tried something new, found a shop we didn't notice on a previous trip, and each visit was a wonder for the senses! I can't wait to make a return trip to Borough Market!||April 19, 2018
Pedal R||50||Admittedly, there are plenty of food markets around London, but Borough market has the widest range of foods, the longest opening hours and even occasional live music. Who doesn't find his taste here is a hopeless case. Meat-lovers enjoy the steak-and-ale-pie or the chorizo-pie, vegetarians the filled injera flatbread, vegans the amazing vegan burgers. For the sweet tooth there are genuine british brownies, fudge and cake as well as sweet little coconut pancakes. The range of cheeses on offer might be somewhat limited but as far as my knowledge goes, this is usually the case in Great Britain. On the other hand, Cheddar, Stilton and Co. are extremely tasty.Make sure to check out the hot chocolate café and give the 100% dark chocolate a try, it's the most amazing beverage I've tried in a long time.||April 18, 2018
rodgernm||10||After a day of touring London we were ready for some fish and chips. We found the stall in Borough market and despite being a tourist area, we decided to try the restaurant- 1. Because it was cold out and there was very limited seating and 2. Because the restaurant boasts 2017 best fish and chips.Despite the restaurant being nearly empty service was very slow and not troubled by the details of the order (2 of our sides were forgotten- could not find the waiter, etc) but moreover, the food was really bland. Fish was fine, but no flavor. Chips were scant (a little annoying since this was not a cheap entree) but again no flavor. Mushy peas needed salt, other sides never showed. We also went without water and beer- tho, our waiter asked if we wanted another round-- as he was clearing our plates.I'm sure tourists are tiring, but this place just didn't measure up. Better off for a cheap takaway place.||April 18, 2018
635RachelO||50||A busy, bustling ambiance. Lots of tasters. Great place to wander and look and maybe buy if you want something different for lunch or don’t mind carrying your purchases around with you! Definitely worth a visit. ||April 17, 2018
ryanh92||50||We were lucky to visit the market on a lovely day in April with the sun poking through the clouds every now and again. The market is located under the bridges of the underground and the trains so you will have some noise but it is nothing more than the bustle of business going on around you. The amount of local venders is dizzying. From local cheese, wine, and meat, to venders from nearby country’s France, Germany, and Italy etc. Everyone we talked to was super friendly and helpful to figure out any ingredients for dishes. Their are some outstanding restaurants around the area that use ingredients from the local venders. Great fun for the whole family!||April 17, 2018
1961GaryC||50||We only had time for a quick wander round the market on a Monday (when not all stalls are open).There was still an almost unlimited choice of things to eat and drink and plenty of atmosphere in the market. Had a quick snack and a tour of the place which left me wanting to go back and try other food (Paella, Malaysian Chicken Curry, Hog Roast, etc etc).||April 17, 2018
Hollow101||40||Group: 5 (Ages 8-41)Time of Visit: Morning/LunchtimeDay of Visit: Saturday I have been to Borough Market a few times now and so whilst it's not new to me, as s massive foodie it has still not lost any of its shine.The whole place is a buzz of excitement, noise, smell and sights. If you like food you will love this place, with stalls selling everything you could almost think of to eat, both to enjoy now and to take home and cook (or cook with).We had ensured that we were there for lunch, enabling us to savour some of the great food on offer, from one of the many stalls, offering food from around the world.You can easily spend a good few hours wandering round and enjoying the samples on offer, in addition to being so easy to get too with s tube stop right outside the door.||April 16, 2018
sivmee||50||Great food, sweets, drink.. From around the world++. Avoid around lunchtime.. Best to have time and space to wander around and enjoy .......... ...................................||April 16, 2018
act0813||50||Foodies heaven. Go hungry and leave stuffed. Get there before 11am as it gets busy fast. We happened to be walking from Tower Bridge towards Westminster Abby location, east to west. The venders vary from produce stores ( veggies & fruits to meat and fish) with tons of food carts and stores that sell baked goods to cheeses and breads. We got muscles in a white wine sauce and some bread to go with it. And some baked goods to take along the rest of the walk. Delish. ||April 15, 2018
Bonnie-hello||40||Even in a weekday morning, there were quite a lot of shops opened. People are friendly. Can easily spend few hours to stroll around and simple food. The fresh oysters and sea urchins were opened in front of you. And there are public seating for you to sit down and enjoy the food. ||April 15, 2018
307cliver||40||Finding places to go for free with a 12 year old in London is difficult. However this market is interesting for all ages, so many different stalls to look at makes it special.We spent well over an hour wandering around taking in sights, sounds and smells that are on offer. We tasted lots of free samples, always a hit with kids and bought a couple of things for nibbling for the rest of the day.Worth a visit.||April 15, 2018
italy085||50||We visited the market on a Saturday morning.. the place is amazing. The atmosphere is truly wonderful. such a variety of produce. every type of cooked food stall there..definitely worth a visit when in London.||April 14, 2018
Lundygirl||40||We had a lovely walk down over the Millennium Bridge and down the riverside to the market. There was so much on offer - some to eat straight away, some to take away. We sampled lots and had a fab time. The quality was superb. The only disappointment was the lack of seats / benches to sit down and eat - think there might have been some tables somewhere but it wasn’t signposted. It was busy but a great atmosphere. We will definitely visit again. ||April 14, 2018
has74||40||Whilst this is essentially a market the setting and the quality of the food make it worth a visit - often free samples on the stalls ||April 14, 2018
MelBobRedux||30||Maybe our expectations were too high, but this was not what we thought it would be. Basically, a big covered market with a large number of specialty vendors - some quite good. Had some good pasta and lamb lunch items and then hit a chocolate vendor. Good for a lunch stop on the go but not much more and perhaps not worth a special trip if not in the area.||April 14, 2018
Giraffe99Jackie||50||I absolutely love Borough Market . The atmosphere is electric. Amazing food stalls and shops that offer so much choice, spices, cheese, fish, meat, fruits and vegetables, artisan breads etc...then there is the food to eat . So many different types of food to choose from so a visit a few times a day every day would be needed to give them all a try... There are plenty of places where you can actually find a spot to sit down.... very useful if you have bought yourself a tray of mussels to eat....||April 13, 2018
tentgirl||50||Borough Market really is a feast for the eyes. With stalls selling every food conceivable, it's a great place to meander. I'm a very reluctant cook but I came away excited about food! I plan to go back.It's just a stone's throw away from London Bridge railway/underground and buses are plentiful.Also, if you're a Bridget Jones fan, don't forget to pop to The Globe Tavern right next door where the exterior of her flat was filmed. ||April 13, 2018
Lindybow||40||It was hellish - walking round looking at all those stalls with the most amazing food, cheeses, salamis, chocolates and sea food - oysters and lobster and knowing that we could not carry anything else back with us, because we were going onto a restaurant later that evening, We did stop for something to eat, six of us had something different, from pie and chips, to the most amazing grilled cheese sandwiches, to mac and cheese, we even found somewhere to sit and people watch whilst we were eating, it was heaven.Massively crowded, and you do need to nudge your way through parts of it but it all adds to the amosphere. Great place - will have to go again just to get to the bits i missed on this visit,||April 13, 2018
Poojagupta4246||50||We were so lucky to visit this place. It was a huge market with almost all type of food.Various type of cheese, bread, fruits, hot wine, fresh food and veggies. We munched in so many varieties of dishes from the food stalls and the best part was free tasting facility. Taste you food first and then buy. Must visit place. ||April 13, 2018
Ogi0||10||We visited it on Monday, according to the site, most booths had to work, but everything was closed and they only worked one or two booths and several restaurants.||April 12, 2018
POTTERS-LONDON||30||I really enjoyed walking around the Market but when I ordered food from a stall the money was taken and put in the till then change given with hands that were actually handling the food, no gloves no tongs just direct food handling. Please Borough Market ensure that food hands are not cash hands as well, it is so wrong and so unhygienic. I refused the food and got my money back, I shall eat elsewhere in future.||April 11, 2018
amadar||50||If we could give it a 10 we would! We have traveled to most European countries and these markets are just as good if not better! The selection of cheeses, salami, chocolate and endless of other fresh food including oysters, beautiful beef are just an endless choice for a foodie fan! Many of the stores have samples which is a great way to explore different foods. Very easy to get to, just take the London bridge tube and it's pretty much opposite the entrance.||April 11, 2018
G746XCdanielam||50||This place it is amazing to check some local and independent market. I take the opportunity to have lunch.I went on Saturday, it was crazy... maybe trying during the week would be much better!!!I ate a chicken hamburger $5 (WYNDHAM HOUSE POULTRY) it was delicious....Homemade chicken hamburger and there are options of chicken wrap and chicken wings... sweet chilli and mayo.Natural ($3) and detox ($5) juices are also good options, it is kind of expensive, but really worth . They are all made with real fruit.||April 11, 2018
keeshias||40||We came to visit Borough Market twice. We really liked the food here. The fish and chips, paella, cheese, pastries, cakes and hot chocolate! It was mouth watering! The place is really like a food mercato. No fancy tables and chairs. You can eat standing up or eat at the benches sharing with other people. We bought some London Cheese to be brought home to Philippines and it was kinda expensive still. I love it here! Definitely, recommended!||April 10, 2018
MummaFish48||50||Just be aware it is closed on a Sunday! We didn't even think about that as just assumed it would be open! So need to go back next time we are in London! Looked good from what we could see behind the shutters!! To be fair the website does state it is closed on a Sunday!||April 10, 2018
DIVINGPCOLA||50||This market is not only full with fruit and vegetables stands, this market houses a large variety of food stands too. From sweets, coffee, fish, meats, vegan, and just about every ethnic food out there in the world (Thai, Malaysian, German, Columbia’s, Spanish, etc...).I highly recommend the paella, muscles, and calamari at Furness Fish Market. It is only 7 GBP per plate and the quality is amazing. They also have oysters and sea urchins here. Oysters are 2 GBP each and urchins are 3 GBP each. They are very fresh. I also recommend the fish and chips here. I could find the name of the stand but I posted a picture here. It is 10 GBP for one order of Cod Fish and Chips. SECRET: I have been here twice now and the biggest problem I hear everyone saying is where can I sit down to eat. Well, at the front of the market, you will find an area to sit down and eat but is is always crowded and you would be lucky to find one seat. But close by the Furness Fish Market, you will see signs to the restroom. Follow those signs. Yes, they will lead you to the restroom but next to the restroom there is a wooden stadium style seats available for use. This place is rarely crowded because it is somehow hidden from the rest of the market. This market is with in. 15-20 walk from Tower of London so it is a great place to eat after visiting the Tower of London. Enjoy this place. Cheers!||April 10, 2018
Jimmyma2||50||Visited on a Monday, walked around first , tried a few tasters, very nice. Settled for Calamari with chilliest and a sweet chilli dipping sauce. Had a glass of bubbly for £6 to wash it down . ||April 10, 2018
cameragirl555||50||If you love exploring outdoor markets in other countries, this is a must see for London!Born in the year 1014 so lots of history. Many market stalls along with fresh food vendors cooking or grilling on site. Many unique items. This is not your typical small farmer's market, it is huge and includes both indoor and outdoor stalls. Many times there is live music as well.Try to avoid the weekend as it gets crowded but go anyway if that is your only option!Check the website too as there are weekdays not all vendors are open, Friday is the best day as most vendors are open but you don't have the weekend crowds.Take your camera, lots of great photo ops of both food, architecture and people!||April 9, 2018
Angela H||50||Myself and my son visited Borough Market for the first time and so glad we did. It has a great atmosphere and has loads of stalls to visit each selling a range of different produce. I had oysters and champagne and loved them both ! Unfortunately we were getting the train home otherwise I would have bought much more than I actually did! Will definitely return on our next visit to London. ||April 9, 2018
tommasopapini||40||Very cool market full of streed food stands, both of typical English cuisine and foreign cuisine from many countries around the world. The place is very characteristic and is worth for either a quick visit of for eating something. You can also buy many things, such as cheese, tea or fresh vegetables.||April 9, 2018
Laurie I||50||I came here on a chilly grey day after a morning at the Tate Modern. What a fun market! You can do your grocery shopping here and you are guaranteed to have fabulous meals. Or you can visit amazing food carts for a meal, which you are forced to eat standing up or take away with you. There is some seating in the fancy hall up front, though. I had a "lamb box" and wished I could try everything. Definitely visit the cheese guys. The cheese is not only delicious but also beautiful. Amazing pastries. Smoothies. Fresh-baked breads. Even good coffee (which can be hard to find in London).||April 9, 2018
rahuld140||40||If you are a foodie, you will love this place. We ended up here one afternoon at the end of a walking tour during our recent visit to London. The market was bustling with visitors, street food stalls, organic produce, baked delights, meat, sea food and a wide range of cheese that was both visually appealing as much as to the olfactory sense. The kids were hungry when we landed there and happily gorged on pastries that we picked up from one of the bakeries. We strolled around through the various colorful lanes with it's stack of produce and meat and cheese .I wanted to try Kappacasein diary and the wife and I shared a raclette (potatoes and grilled raclette cheese ) and though the cheese was fresh, the dish was ok. Wish I tried their sandwiches. The walking tour guide had also recommended to try Monmouth coffee which we ditched because of a long line outside. Instead we got the kids gelato and treated myself with a cappucino at the nearby Gelateria 3 Bis and it was awesome. ||April 8, 2018
katherineDerbyshire||50||Wow it's fabulous, smells lovely takes you on a journey with fresh bread fruit, street sellers with cup cakes cookies soups, everything you could imagine is there, don't think there are any bargains to be found but as s treat wow doesn't get much better. ||April 8, 2018
brentwoodmom48||50||Stopped by after the Tower of London for heavenly snacking! Although it was rainy and cold, the explosion of beautiful food displays kept us going. Fish & Chips, scallops, turkish delight, exotic meat burgers, croissants and fresh pressed juices. So yummy. Plenty of sampling to do. Our kids loved it. It could use more seating or bars to eat your food, but otherwise it was a wonderful pit stop.||April 8, 2018
blondiejezdevil||50||Now, I love my food. So for me this place was heaven. The colours, sights, smells...it was.pure sensory overload. There was so much to walk and look around, and huge amounts of street food to choose from. I imagine it would be packed of a lunchtime. Definitely worth a visit if it is your first time in london, however I can't imagine young children would particularly enjoy it. ||April 7, 2018
annavesela||40|| Very cool! A must visit for food lovers. Lost of high quality selection, free samples, and other wares to buy! The products are quite expensive, but the quality is there! However do be prepare for a crowd!||April 7, 2018
MalcolmW648||50||Our first visit to borough market, blown away with the quality and variety of produce and street food on offer, we absolutely loved it despite the torrential rain on good Friday afternoon, also a good choice of local pubs for a few drinksWe will definitely be visiting again when next in London, have to say I am somewhat jealous that locals have such amazing produce in their doorsteps||April 7, 2018
poisson2018||40||I went on a Friday around 14.00.The place was buzzing. The food was beautifully displayed. Huge variety of cheese, salami, sausage. Didn't give it 5 stars because I found it expensive. Try the different pâtés in the Spanish food stall and get some Greek olive oil. I also bought fish and lamb, both extrememy fresh. Will certainly visit again||April 7, 2018
shamellj5||50||Wonderful atmosphere with a huge variety of wonderful food. Hard to pass up. Went today and will be going on my final full day here tomorrow. ||April 6, 2018
Cyril J||50||If you are visiting london, you cannot miss the borough market, loads of choices of food, cheese, wine that you are spoilt.||April 6, 2018
683owens||50||So many artisan food stalls and so much to try. Had the Shetland crispy squid, bought some amazing nduja from Calabria and boar salami. Went to the Argentinian good place and had awesome empanadas. The steak sandwich however was a let down. Monmouth coffee is there too. Tip go to the buying coffee part of you want to get served quicker.||April 6, 2018
Charona3101||50||Great food and superb produce. A foodie heaven. I love La Boqueria in Barcelona but this is better given its international array of choice and flavours. A lovely, cosmopolitan feel to the place and choice for anybody. A must visit if you like food! ||April 6, 2018
SamAdamstown||40||So much great food and drink in a relaxed and friendly location. You can wander and graze - enjoy the sights and smells and discover new tastes. Fab place for individuals, couples or groups - something for everyone to eat and not at rip off London prices. Well worth a look on your lunch break or a longer roam if you have the time. You can buy everything from hand picked tea to fresh seafood or butchered hares and mushrooms - plus plenty of tea, coffee, beer and cider to wash it down. For those not keen eating on the move still plenty of places to sit down, or you can pop into the grounds of Southwark Cathedral for a rest. Minutes from the Thames but a little world of its own. Will definitely go back again, and again...||April 5, 2018
B1136NNmelissac||50||I absolutely love this place.The market is amazing. When it comes to food they offer everything you can think of and even more. There is a lot of international cuisine but also amazing cakes and pastries as well as an actual farmer‘s market. I recommend to go there with an empty stomach. ||April 5, 2018
carly433344||50||This place is something I had never heard of and am so glad I visited. Was worth it and Definatly if you go try some of the food! It tastes amazing! ||April 5, 2018
tgsandy||50||Our niece took us here and we just loved the place. The place has everything! It huge and all vendors seem to be top quality. We ate a lot and purchased cheese, truffles and truffle oil from Croatia , craft beer from Ireland, etc. This place will be at the top of our “must do list” the next time we visit London. ||April 4, 2018
DoozeUK||50||This is a must to visit for any foodie in London. Whilst it is an iconic market, the food stalls offer such a wide variety of different cuisines and street foods to eat. A definite for lunch with the family as there is always something to satisfy everyone’s taste at a great price for London too.Also if you want to buy cheese, meats or veg/salad then there is some great products to choose from. ||April 4, 2018
827martinob||40||This place offers food from all countries and the quality is superb . It get very busy here so expect loads of people . The best ice cream parlour is also round the corner and loads of good eateries ||April 3, 2018
esteban18_89||40||Been there on a gloomy Saturday morning thinking that it's not going to be packed as there was a bit of rain outside. Been wrong of course, the place was bustling with locals and tourists each trying to get a bite. A lot of things to enjoy here but do try the pulled pork sandwiches as they're really a highlight of the market. Would definitely go back! Prices a bit steep but nothing that'd seem way too expensive anyway. Go try it out!||April 3, 2018
Rupert D||40||My wife and I absolutely love wandering around the market trying different foods..... having breakfast and buying great cheese or other wonderful produce to take home for the weekend. Lots of choice and delicious food......can get a bit crowded but that's part of the experience||April 3, 2018
ian_dempster||40||Visited before and went straight after going to Maltby market. It now just seems to busy to really enjoy. Still a great market but enjoyed Maltby more this visit.||April 3, 2018
Chasingdreamscape||50||A great selection of stalls , street food providers , interesting shops and top quality eateries . The range of food styles available , in such a small area is remarkable. Levantine food, Tapas, street food, traditional pub, cafe style , grills or oysters to name a few — marvellous ! It’s a busy area so if you do want to eat at a specific restaurant either decide to sit down early or book. Either that or be prepared to queue. ||April 3, 2018
Pinksteph369||50||Always so enjoy this whole market . Brilliant just brilliant . Always buy some reality interesting bits . This time it was fabulous cheese from Neil’s Yard . Spanish pimento and saffron from the Spanish shop . Always fun always so good !! ||April 1, 2018
luvroma2||50||Saturday is the busiest day at this market. It is the day that most of the food stalls and restaurants are open. The selection of fruit, cheese, meats, vegetables, produce, seafood, bread, pastries and prepared food items is extensive and of the highest quality. There are many vendors who come from France and Italy for the market. There are organic and hydroponic offerings. It is an incredible market but it can get very crowded - especially on a Saturday so be prepared.||April 1, 2018
guv54||50||Great street food. Very busy be prepared to queue. Highly recommend great all round for a visit and for tourist to experience The globe tavern for liquid refreshments ||April 1, 2018
Mark_eastman||50||If you love artisanal food then the borough market is for you. There is a huge range on offer from fruit & Veg to meat, fish ,Cheese bread, the list goes on. Every seller has a real passion for there products and this makes it a real hub for cooks and chefs to find great ingredients from around the world . So if you love food you will be in heaven here.||March 31, 2018
Matt_5891||40||Have you ever imagined a place where you can order an Italian starter, an Ethiopian main and a Thai dessert? Well, if yes, you just thought about Borough Market.In this place there are stands literally representing many different cuisines and the variety of food is just impressive. This should be a ‘must see’ for every person or tourist walking down Southwark.||March 31, 2018
xyz4484604||50||We ate here for lunch 3 times during our visit. So much British and international food to choose from. I really enjoyed the sandwich from Roast Hog and the bratwurst place at the front although just fare warning the mustard is very Dijon like so get ketchup only if you don’t like Dijon. The pastry shops here are also all good. I didn’t love the sandwich from Boston Sausage. British sausage is terrible if you compare to that seen in the USA. ||March 31, 2018
lisahO3311YH||50||The market is a maze of several streets of glorious food venders. The cheese and mulled wine are my favorite. Great place to shop, eat and drink. ||March 31, 2018
Peter B||40||Great buzz to the place and incredibly aromas! Lots of food to admire / eat! Well worth a Visit. Also take in the Shard views.||March 31, 2018
Alison A||40||Vast selection of things to eat,many vegan friendly options. Worth the visit for Spice Mountain alone! best selection of herbs and spices!! Very reasonably priced. ||March 31, 2018
jenniferlJ9069NM||50||Perfect lunch spot. I was so overwhelmed in the best way possible. Come hungry and bring cash. Amazing food!!! It's all outside and there is limited seating.||March 30, 2018
Preston88||50||Love this place but be careful as you can spend a fortune in minutes!! So many lovely meats, cheeses, breads, fish, cakes etc. Gets really busy around lunchtime. Def recommend the paella & burgers!! ||March 30, 2018
hayleebernstein||50||The food is made right in front of you and is all so good. Our kids enjoyed the seafood and chicken paella, my husband had some pork sandwich and I had a falafel sandwich. I only wish I was still hungry so I could have tried something else. Yummy!!||March 30, 2018
jogibbo||50||I cannot tell you how much I love this place. 48 hours in London and we ate here twice. The first day we chose Ethiopian stew. It was simply incredible and amongst the best food we’ve ever tasted. So much choice makes it tricky but a tip is to look for the longest queue. The next day we went back and had venison burger and lamb burgers. Simple yet delicious once again. It’s a must visit in London. Already looking forward to the next time ||March 30, 2018
Kaitlyn A||40||A great place to walk around and try a lot of different food! Come hungry and leave full! Definitely a must to experience the people and culture of London. ||March 29, 2018
onedaythreetimes||40||A must visit when you are in London.The freshly shuck oysters are very tasty.The fish and chips are very tasty.Not to forget Monmouth , where many say is the best coffee in London .||March 29, 2018
LovesLastShift||50||Give here a visit for sure! The smells, atmosphere and choices are truely astonishing. Something to suit everyones individual taste buds A+||March 28, 2018
SchmidtBerliner||50||Borough Market is a fantastic outdoor food stall market near to the London Bridge. We were told my our friends that we were staying with to go & it was lots of fun. So many different food types, we all tried different things. I had some wonderful salt beef which was out of this world and then we take cup cakes home with us. If you are hungry go here and you will eat like a king or queen ||March 27, 2018
Robert E||50||Slow down for a bit and take your time as you stroll through the market salivating over the delicious smells wafting through the air. Tons of free samples and plenty of options.||March 26, 2018
Alicia M||50||Came for lunch and hard to make a choice where to eat there was such a huge variety to choose from. Fresh oysters, urchins, Thai, Spanish, breads OMG! We ended up eating at BROOD Cafe and it was delicious.||March 26, 2018
Kim G||50||What a variety of fresh and prepared foods for any taste.!! This market is incredible Great prices . Lots of areas to sit and savour your purchases||March 25, 2018
Kelvin76||50||Colorful, vibrant and very busy. Great to just take in the atmosphere while tucking in to some of the great grub. The duck confit sandwich was good. As was the mushroom soup. Paella was decent. ||March 23, 2018
CheleDoubleU||40||Whether you're buying ingredients to cook with or wanting to pick up something already prepared Borough Market has something for everyone.It's a real treat of food stalls lots of small independent traders offering a selection of raw ingredients or freshly prepared bread, cakes and meals from around the world.||March 23, 2018
Daniel A||40||Great open air, covered market with street food, snacks, wine etc. Definitely grab a sangria and walk around eating to your hearts desire. Not ideal for dinner as everything closes early. Run through for lunch or snacks, get a pie, raclettes, scotch egg, or some fish and chips. Fun for about an hour or so.||March 22, 2018
Tommy G||50||Myself and my girlfriend are both huge foodies and this place was like our heaven! Amazing street food and an equally amazing atmosphere ||March 22, 2018
tracy p||50||We love it here. Good quality food, from bakery, fruit, spices etc. Fantastic street food. We visited on a Tuesday. We could move around easily, as unlike the weekend it wasn't crowded. Heaven ! We purchased cheeses, bread, doughnuts and kitchenware. Also had a breakfast of dhal, rice and a cauliflower dish.It was washed down with a latte from Monmouth.||March 22, 2018
AugustoN475||50||Take two hours once in London, and one of the days, go there.You will find plenty of stalls, offering food, at a very reasonable prices.Food, from a lot of countries, meat, fish, oysters,vegetables, cheese, breads, pork, rice. sushi. etc...Buy your dish and then go to another stall where to buy your drink; juice, wine, sparkling, beer, cava ...Feel the atmosphere and look up to the roof as well, discover how beautiful the construction is.One of the oldest markets in London, refurbished to the new times and new generations, where many locals spend part of their time to eat something.Enjoy !!||March 21, 2018
RyanO1462||50||This was our first stop on our London trip. It was a great way to start off seeing the city between the food and the atmosphere we loved it.||March 21, 2018
bgs20086||50||We went on our way to Shakespeare’s Globe and looked at all the wonderful foodie stalls. Expensive but SO appealing, the stall holders take such care and pride in their displays. Any supermarket in UK is completely outclassed. Some of the produce may be sampled. We ate samosas, bhajis (spelling?) and thali (sp?) from a Gujarati stall, and all of them were utterly delicious and filling.And well done to them for their paper packaging and wooden spoons: no plastic. ||March 20, 2018
185neily||50||Borough Market is said to be several hundred years old. You’ll find it at the south end of London Bridge ( NOT Tower Bridge) a short walk from London Bridge railway/underground station. There is a fantastic collection of stalls from fresh fish and sea food to fresh and cured meats and game, chocolate to cakes & bread. There are exotic foods (meats and cooked street-food), numerous cheese stalls, vegetable, fungi and spices stalls, vegan food stalls and restaurants and a fish & chip shop.Closed on SundayPartial market - some shops openMonday & Tuesday 10:00 - 17:00Full market - all shops openWednesday & Thursday 10:00 - 17:00Friday 10:00 - 18:00Saturday 08:00 - 17:00You can happily spend a couple of hours here - and much too much money if you are easily tempted by fabulous food.||March 20, 2018
sydneyhooley||50||The market has a hot food section and a bigger market section. The hot foods are all pretty eclectic but delicious. Vegan and vegetarian options are available. Pad Thai, meat pies, samosas, Mac and cheese, etc. I’ve been everytime I come to London because it’s so good and you can try a bit of everything!! Try a sausage roll or samosa if you haven’t yet in London||March 20, 2018
yannick b||40||Hello,I went to London with school and we saw a lot of things. But the thing I liked the most was Borough Market. Borough Market is a market where they serve food from around the whole world.When I walked there, I just didn’t knew what I had to eat.Everything I could imagine, I’ve found there. From fries to pancakes, from Chinese food to Italian food, etc.If you walk there, you just eat way to much because everything just smells way to good.By the time I’ve got there I wasn’t hungry but strange enough I ate very much.I ate from the Chinese food, I ate brownies and I ate fish and chips.My favorite was the brownie, I’ve never ever eaten a brownie as tasteful as that one!I hope that when you visit Borough Market, you like it as much as I did!Yannick Bastiaensen© 20/03/2018 9:30||March 20, 2018
Agneszena||50||There is something for everyone here, whether you’re looking for a quick breakfast or lunch, something to take home for later, a gift, or ingredients for cooking. Such a wide variety of stalls, and queues go down very fast. Perfect place for trying new foods. ||March 19, 2018
Dan D||50||This was my first time to England and this was a gem. We had just ate lunch and regret we did that before we got there. What a great place and I would have loved to eat here. In the end we got some cheese, some bread and some donuts. While I was there I got a latte from the coffee place there and a cannoli from the Italian pastry shop around the corner. Great food, great place I would love to go here again!||March 19, 2018
Matt S||50||As a tourist couple, even in a nice hotel, one lives a sort of rationed existence. One bathroom, comically teeny wastebaskets. Even the all-you-can-eat concierge level breakfasts lean on the same four or five items morn after mourn. So an embarrassment of choice and plenty as is found at Borough Market is nothing less than a welcome delight. We strolled around for close to an hour, identifying twenty or thirty strong possibilities, before finally zeroing in on a few winners. There are pigeons, limited bench seating and it's under some dirty, old bridge, so it might not work for Ivanka Trump, but I think most visitors will enjoy themselves here. Feels very London, old and new, and wastebaskets are appropriately sized.||March 19, 2018
alorahble||40||We first went to the Borough Market on our first day in London (A Monday) to find it unfortunately closed. We returned a second time on Tuesday to find it abuzz with many different people and products. We all had a freshly squeezed juice from a local vendor and enjoyed sampling many different types of food like fried squid and freshly made bread. If you love food this is definitely a place to visit in London while you're there!||March 19, 2018
Netty1313||50||Really enjoyed having a look around the market- even on a Monday when a fair few outlets closed there was still plenty to see, buy and taste!The country needs more of this type of place - many (town) markets are’ soulless’ with a few good proper market stalls the rest cheap and nasty imported stuff but not here - make sure you visit and town planners incorporate such things around the country!||March 19, 2018
EY1972||40||love to visit when in London. always great interesting options to try, from restaurants, to bars, to food stands.did come mid-week, so was not so crowded.note that the food stand area is only partly covered, so if raining you can find yourself standing in lines in the rain for some stands.||March 19, 2018
claudiasmf||40||The place is lovely. You can find really interesting street food stands and the place is full of lifeWarning: tends to be quite crowded!||March 19, 2018
Omi869||50||Great day out had some friends visiting and took them to see the market and was very surprised. The food smell so fresh and looks so great. Must visit again soon! ||March 18, 2018
ian5552019||50||One of my favourite markets. Try different food from all over the world. Always busy with a lively buzz. Eat drink and be merry. A must see and do if you are in London.||March 18, 2018
catch222||40||Loved it.... Went early on a Saturday morning, 9ish, when it wasn't too crowded. A lot more people when I left a couple of hours later. London is one of them places, if you want to see something, see it early..I thought a quick look around would be all I'd want to do as I hate markets. This market is actually a lot of modern stalls, all looking good, selling their goods. Expect to spend.One thing I must comment on - the stall holders are excellent. They were so helpful, so willing to explain their goods and all done without a growl.||March 18, 2018
justalittlebitocd||40||This market is worth a visit to. It has such a great atmosphere and has a plethora of food stall choices that your senses will be overwhelmed. I suggest you have a walk around and work out what you desire the most. OR try a few different places ;)Located near London Bridge Train station||March 16, 2018
Benjamin H||50||I am a regular in the market. Exploring the delights of the market is one of the most excellent things one can do in London. The finest produce from all over the globe is here. My favourites are the Borough Cheese Company's Comté, absolutely exquisite; and the fine hams at Varley and Crouch around the corner. There are many fine bakeries but Olivier's takes my custom. For coffee I wonder over to the Monmouth coffee company on the edge of the market where you must have the pour-over filter coffee. The market can be busy, and the bustle is one of the attractions, however respite is welcome. I was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon The Haywood Gallery artist-run project space on my visit this week. An artist called Kit Trowbridge was exhibiting and her digital illustration work was pithy, humorous and ultimately engaging.||March 14, 2018
Nan H||50||I went to the market on a Wednesday and enjoyed the fresh seafood sold here. I think this market has the best street food in the uk .||March 13, 2018
QLD_Oz_Walkers||40||A great atmosphere, so many food stall choices to suit all gourmet tastes. Well worth a visit. I recommend having a good walk through till you see what appeals to you or try a few different stalls? I chose traditional lamb pie & my daughter went Asian noodles. Well priced & ample serves. Plenty of interesting sites nearby including the Shard, London Tower Bridge & Thames river front walking.||March 12, 2018
Les M||50||We all tried different foods- Ethiopian was fab, esp their vegetable dishes. The Indian street food was delicious. We also had some Balkan pastries - lovely! There's a great feel to the market. Although it's busy, doesn't feel too crushed and was good idea for lunch. Afterwards, we wandered through the stalls making a few purchase and enjoying food samples. Would definitely recommend||March 12, 2018
mtvgb||40||Really enjoyed our visit to Borough Market. We visited with friends one of whom has mobility problems. We booked parking at London Bridge NCP which worked perfectly. We then ate at Maria’s which was brilliant. Delicious old fashioned caff that was fantastic value. Our friends were regulars so could help with which stalls to visit as some are majorly overpriced. All in all great and we would go again.||March 11, 2018
Gwannis||50||Wow this was really an impressive visit. All types of street food stalls one different to the others and the food offered was very good. A must to visit when in london just under London bridge.||March 11, 2018
WILLIAM1066||50||One of my favourite places on earth. Prices can be a bit steep but the quality and variety and choice is staggering.Watch your pockets. Pick-pockets are a constant menace.||March 11, 2018
Frenchfay||40||Little too busy for me but enjoyed our brief visit. Amazing smells everywhere and variety of food. We didn't eat but bought cheese and chorizo from stalls . Worth a visit for sure .||March 10, 2018
MickeyJ21||50||It’s easy to spend an hour or two here. There is so many delicious food stands an it’s nearly impossible to choose. We tried a cheese sandwich which was one of the best I’ve ever have tasted. ||March 10, 2018
99Janet65||50||Great choice of food only problem is which do you decide to try first. Not very many places to sit so be prepared to eat on the move.||March 10, 2018
Spier999||30||Love it in Borough Market it’s a special place and has a good vibe.Lunch Times is a no no. Too many people and queues.Not a place where you could eat every day unless you had a good income!!Always good for a one off.. pubs good too.||March 10, 2018
Kerrivv||50||I found this market by accident when attending a conference near here. It is fantastic. Full of traditional English fare and french food and delicacies from all over the world at affordable prices. Wonderful little cafes throughout. Pop down there for breakfast and then go back at dinner time and it is totally different each time of the day.||March 9, 2018
camilasitonio||50||It truly is a huge gastronomic fair: you can find food from a lot of places in the world. The market space is also quite interesting, from sweets to meat, you can find it all.||March 8, 2018
JayPee2UK||50||We LOVED it here. So much choice of food drinks.The smells, people, atmopshere and vendors!Fabulous day out and so much to see eat and drink!!!We will deffinatley come back here. Even though it was cold and snowy it was still an amazing place to visit.Dont get me wrong the crowds were VAST but we still managed to have a mooch and buy some pastries :-D||March 8, 2018
Steve V||50||Whether you are carnivore, herbivore, vegan, or vegetarian, there is something here for you to enjoy. Lovely food from around the globe, a tad pricey, but well worth it. Sweet or savoury, its all here. Feed your face then walk off the exessess with a walk beside the Thames.All in all a great day out||March 7, 2018
myhappyplace85||50||I have to admit I love this place, as an amateur photographer its a little bit of heaven, people, produce, textures, smells... its awesome....||March 7, 2018
maggietracey1966||30||I would have rated this market 5 apart from the disturbing site of a whole pig being roasted and another stall naming itself "From Bullet to Borough".I found both these stalls to be offensive and in bad taste. Just before my visit to the market I visited the London Tombs, to everyone's horror we were given a brief history lesson about medieval times when they used to put the heads of criminals on spikes on London Bridge for everyone to see. We are all shocked at how barbaric we used to be, however, after a short walk from the Tombs I end up at Borough Market and see the above. I'm left wondering have we really progressed as much as we like to think we have!As I said at the start though, apart from the above, the rest of the market was a pleasant experience, with some fabulous food stalls.||March 6, 2018
DawnV238||50||We do consider ourselves amateur foodies and this was a great place to sample lots of things, the stall holders were very amenable and offered their wares without it being an issue whether you buy or not ||March 6, 2018
wanderlust4adventure||50||Definitely worth a visit! There are so many food stalls and everything looks/smells great. Would definitely recommend going her for lunch, a snack, or just a walk through. ||March 6, 2018
OzoneSpin||50||Borough Market is a short walk from London Bridge station and opens very early for people that want fresh veggies and fish and cannot wait for the ordinary shops. There is an enormous selection of fish you will not see on supermarket fish counters and a lot fresher, with better prices. Vegetable’s quality is second to none - plenty of street food and nookie places for early business breakfast.||March 6, 2018
910sued||50||Fascinating market selling every type of fresh food you could want. Wish we had not eaten before we went as the choice of places to eat was varied and looked delicious. Very old London style market. Informed that the market operates all week but told that the best days to visit are Thursday, Friday or Saturday.||March 5, 2018
NantwichFlatley||40||Fight your way through the crowds and join the queues for the food stalls as its well worth it. But which queue do you join as there is so much choice?! I finally went for a Herdwick lamb wrap which tasted fantastic. Recommended on any visit to London.||March 5, 2018
Beerbellyhelper||50||My wife and I live in Manchester and we both love this market so much that we’re genuinely planning to visit London again just for this market! The fresh food, cooked food stalls, the cake and sweet stands, it’s all phenomenal. We’re all about the food but there are other stalls there too, couldn’t tell you what they are though. ||March 4, 2018
valentinpotor||50||Must go when in London. Nice restaurants, pubs, street food with a impressive variety and lots of local and imported vegetable, fruits, dairy and meats available. More than one visit is required :)||March 4, 2018
l_ono138||50||Try to enter the market from the smaller streetside entrance right after passing london bridge from the north side. The traditional farmers market and food stalls have delicious food (slightly at a high price). We shared some empanada and Balkan sweets. A romantic place for a hungry couple on Saturday.||March 4, 2018
871arifk||50||This is a must visit place for all the foodies! Varieties of Cheese, Organic foods, i even found Indian food stall there.||March 3, 2018

FZTG||40||Lots of stalls with different types of bread, cakes, biscuits, sweets, nuts etc. Different types of food to cater for all. A special mention to the vegan cafe ‘big V’ - the Valloumi Burger was delicious! ||March 3, 2018
marceldu||50||We were amazed by the great food options at this market! From fresh fish to wild game, fresh local produce to shops dedicated to honey or licorice, and numerous cheese shops, it had a wide variety of food options. The prepared foods were also delicious looking! Very, very big sandwiches, breads, desserts, etc. It's all there! We were there on a Saturday early afternoon and it was quite crowded. Definitely will come back the next time we come to London!||March 3, 2018
veronicavolpe96||40||I'm currently living alone in London for studying and I love moving around in search of markets about food or else. I'm going there to find something to eat as a Vegan, and fortunately I found some upmarket and street food really nice. This is one of my fav Market ever in London. It's romantic and for family as well. No entry fee and a lot of healty stuff.It's a bit small, but it's worth it!||March 3, 2018
Mark P||50||Well worth checking out, this is a HUGE food market with all kinds of tasty things to sample. There are also wine stalls, exotic spices etc etc. Mostly undercover under victorian railway arches which adds to the atmosphere.||March 3, 2018
Nikita0402||50||This place is definitely must visit if you are a food lover. Food stall from so many countries at the same place. There is no entry fee for this but it’s crowded on Saturday afternoon and closed on Sunday.||March 1, 2018
loisd784||50||Foodies Heaven, a mixture of street food and upmarket ingredients , went on a Saturday and it was wall to wall people but well worth the visit, the 344 bus gets you right there||February 28, 2018
464JulieC464||50||Located just outside London Bridge station this is so worth a visit the food stalls are fabulous, cheese, fish, chocolate. The street food is top notch, burgers, frankfurters, Egyptian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, fish and chips. 2 mins from the Shard so you can pop up there for a drink after your visit! ||February 28, 2018
PaulFeist||50||I visited Borough Market on a cool February day (and again on a freezing one), and I have to say that it was one of the highlights of my trip! I visited Thursday Feb 22, and was greeted by so many choices for cheese, bread, various and assorted baked goods, sandwiches, burgers, produce, and charcuterie that I though I'd died and gone to heaven!I spend more than four hours sampling, browsing, and returning repeatedly to the Forest Cider stand for a half-pint of Cider and a lovely chat with Mary Ann. I'd wander off, grab a salt-beef (corned beef to us Americans) sandwich, or some more little samples of cheeses our USDA won't let us have, or a taste of serrano ham or cured sausage, and then return for another half-pint.I am embarrassed to admit, since I live where a large percentage of the U.S. West Coast's oysters are produced, that the English Rock Oysters at Borough market were BETTER than what comes out of Humboldt Bay. It pains me greatly to admit this!I enjoyed this day so much, I returned on Saturday around opening time for a couple quick bites, as I had nothing planned until later in the day.Saturday was bitterly cold, and a cup of hot mulled cider (again from Forest Cider) was welcome! So was a Wild Boar hot dog and the other embarrassing quantity of food I purchased. My suggestion? Fast for a day before visiting and pace yourself! And if you see Mary Ann, the great Irish lady at Forest Cider, tell her you'd like to try the Elderflower cider - Trust me!||February 28, 2018
950NikkiB||50||Visited here again, it’s a great food market where you can get all sorts of different food. I got a vegetarian curry to take away for a quick lunch, it was absolutely fab. My friends got a duck ciabatta which they told me was fab! ||February 28, 2018
Ted G||40||This place is definitely worth a visit (Pies and Mash were great!), but it's way too crowded on Saturday afternoons. So many delicious places to eat and drink. Wish we'd walked through at a calmer time.||February 27, 2018
Kirkham9||50||The food here is out of this world. Definitely come here if you are in London. An Incredible variety of different dishes all of which are amazing. Also just a great place to wonder around as it has a great buzzing atmosphere too.||February 27, 2018
Rebecca M||30||I found this disappointing as I was expecting your standard London street market, but instead it was geared more towards the tourist and the prices are quite steep. Still it's interesting to have a wander around and perhaps buy some street food if your budget will stretch||February 27, 2018
capan2017||50||I really love this market. There are a lot of options of food. And everything is delicious. I reccommend this place!!||February 27, 2018
Matt T||50||This place is awesome, so many different foods to look at and sample. Cheese cheese cheese is everywhere, loads of different meats, the most amazing looking vegetables, wines, pies etc etc. I could spend a whole day looking around here. Loved it!!!||February 26, 2018
sicng||50||We visited the market on a Thursday morning. It was not too crowded. I had the best mushroom soup there. My sister had fresh oysters ...everything is really yummy. The best meat and kidney pie as well. Most booths will give you samples of food also. Really nice place to grab local food and the prices are really affordable ||February 25, 2018
Atu90||50||How anyone goes to London without visiting the market is beyond me. We grabbed a cab from Piccadilly with our children so they weren’t tired of walking, and sampled food for a few hours. How fantastic! Olives, cheeses, salami, curries, roast and potatoes, middle eastern. Wine is available if you like as well. Maybe the best thing we saw during the trip.||February 25, 2018
596clivec||40||If you are a food fan or a photographer, then this place is a must. A huge variety of foods, particularly fruit and vegetables, are beautifully presented in visually stunning displays, within a lovely old market setting.Go earlier in the day to avoid the somewhat stifling crowds that fill all the walkways later in the day, particularly if you are a photographer as you will have much more scope to get the excellent shots that are possible.||February 25, 2018
Jarro||50||We stumbled on this market whilst looking for the Golden Hind and its busy with narrow walkways but the food was amazing, I believe but not 100% sure that Borrow market is the Fruit and Veg side and then its been expanded by hundreds of stalls cooking all types of cuisines and just too many to list but after walking through we believe that you could find almost any type of food you wanted and most smelt lovely. It does get busy and this is compounded with people eating food in every available space around the market. Its great to see and we was not overly worried about the hygiene as it must be over seen by the council and we eat and everyone was fine||February 25, 2018
davidfW7773HH||40||Best to come here late on a Saturday as the stalls are shutting up and want to get rid of their fresh produce at knock down prices. Paid £1 for two large punnets of blueberries. Not a place to come at peak time on a Saturday to do your regular shopping because of the crowds. The confectionary is homemade, some on site and is amazing. ||February 25, 2018
bumblepeas_garden||40||Trendy food market with lots of produce loosely arranged into items such as cheese/cheese, meat, fresh fruit/veg and fish. Not very organised and very crowded. Zoos range of stalls and samples to try but a bit disorienting. Not as good as the markets you get abroad - barcelona’s is far better as it’s less organised and linden era are generally more grumpy/in a hurry. Expect queues at popular food stalls. Lack of places to stand and eat when having purchased the food. If going in winter week up as it can get cold. Look out for the Argentinean empanada stall - the empanadas were really tasty and there was w deal to get two with s glass of wine for around £8. ||February 25, 2018
rdelaine||40||Visited the market on a cold wet day and was welcomed by the warm smells of delicious varieties of food, cheeses, Spanish, Chinese, Thai, baked goods and fishmonger. Worth a visit if you are a foodie.||February 24, 2018
Grace B||20||Walked in this market....too crowed...not the best of hygiene...could be more organised. Everyone tasting different food but when buying too expensive for a market.A doughnut very poor in taste 3 sterlings||February 23, 2018
charlies798||40||This is a must for any London visit.Great bars, restaurants and a market packed with variety.Right next to the River Thames, with the newly refurbished London Bridge station alongside its easy to get to.An absolute must.||February 22, 2018
nicolecherry||50||After a visit to Southwark Cathedral and Garden walk around Borough Market to savour the sites and the smells - then eat amazing Lebanese food at Arabica bar and kitchen - the best babaghanoush/ moutabal in town! Not cheap but authentic and an interesting site under the railway.....||February 22, 2018
shaunmW7433CH||50||I wanted to take spices, particularly curries home to friends. Spice Mountain has a booth here and I scored. Just wish I was hungry! So many tempting foods and gorgeous displays. Most sellers are friendly and happy to chat. Bought pies to take home for dinner.||February 22, 2018
Amanda A||50||It is such a great visit. There are so many options to choose from, something for everyone. Just walking around is so exciting and I wish I could have come back several times. ||February 21, 2018
Eshna C||50||This is like a farmer's market on steroids. While you can find the cheeses, jams, and baked goods, you can also find some amazing food. The prices vary from inexpensive to a tad surprising for food-from-a-stall, but it is usually worth it! I've been here a few times and there has always been something new to try, to taste, and to enjoy.||February 21, 2018
laurie1342||50||I have been buying blood oranges at Teds veg for a number of years. They are zesty, sharp and leave you feeling like Peter Andre in that video when he is chilling under the waterfall. I am never surprised by their excellent customer service and attention to detail but when I went this Saturday the lady behind the counter was particularly kind and helpful. We bought 1 blood orange and a coconut for an extremely reasonable price. Trying to open consume a coconut on the streets of Southwark is not the easiest task but once cracked that did not detract from fact it was refreshing and nourishing beyond belief, much like a cold flannel lain across your brow by Peter Andre on a hot summers day.Ted's veg is an oasis of calm in the turbulent environment that is borough market. I salute you Teds veg, and Peter Andre.||February 20, 2018
chapman-chloe||50||Brought market is good heaven. The only problem is with so many amazing choices it’s hard to pick where to eat! I would highly recommend the Mac and cheese with pulled pork from HASH||February 20, 2018

dynamic14||50||Awesomely interesting market with all sorts of food and huge variety of bread and cheeses. This is one of the oldest and largest food markets in London. One of Britain’s most renown market, Borough Market is located in the centre of London and easily accessible by public transport. Highly recommended. We had the Richard Haward oysters which were simply lovely. ||February 18, 2018
Flaips||40||Great to wander around, taking advantage of free tasters and seeing a range and variety of quality and artisan producers of good food and drink. Sometimes though, you have to decide if the quality is really worth the price or is it hyped up for the tourist ||February 18, 2018
mariamalanzoor||40||Loved this local market, everything was so good and fresh, fruits; vegetables, dates, cheese; and amazing olives Must visit if you are in London ||February 18, 2018
Dave C||50||Bustling on a Saturday, great range of streetfood stalls, plenty of free samples from the cheese/meat stalls, but please do spend money and buy some of their wares. Plenty of pubs on the side streets too.Most stalls accept credit/debit cards now.Free water fountains dotted around, so refill your bottle, toilets and limited seating areas also there.||February 18, 2018
Drumaqueen_MW||40||If I lived in London I would come here early morning, grab some of the amazing breads and cheeses and then hide away all day - eating my way through it The market is absolutely jam packed full of people standing, eating You need to be patient as there are long queues for everything but well worth the wait. ||February 17, 2018
mamouni768||50||I sincerely recommend everyone coming to London to fit a visit to Borough Market in your schedule. There is plenty of food to try and great products to buy such as cheese, tea. In our last visit we tried so much and most of it was delicious such as the cheese sandwiches from Kappacasein, olive breadsticks and doughnuts from bread ahead and malaysian chicken curry. We also bought parmesan cheese of high quality and some greek honey. I’m pretty sure you would enjoy your time there as a foodie.||February 17, 2018
Davos8n8||50||I love this place. The quality and diversity of food is amazing. Go with an appetite and pick your way around the market. I’ve visited many food markets around the world but this is right up there with the very best. ||February 17, 2018
Toyah1||50||Also start here whilst out in London! Love the atmosphere and vibes here! Came here Friday lunchtime with friends who hadn’t been before and they were amazed! So many delicious stalls to choose from! Friend tried a hot salt beef sandwich and said it was delicious! I had hog roast roll but wasn’t to impressed just smothered in rosemary honestly didn’t taste like pork! Just come here to chill and taste and but it’s an amazing market you won’t be disappointed! ||February 16, 2018
lisejangard||50||A wide range of different foods and Small shops with a lot of delicious foods. One just have to remember cash. ||February 16, 2018

Mykuri||50||The day was rainy and cold but we got warm and cozy tasting drinks and Foods of all kinds, colours and flavors. All fresh and inviting to all. ||February 15, 2018
G-J-T-AND-K||50||If ever I find myself in this part of London I must have a poke around here but it's not fully open every day . Go Wednesday through Saturday between 10 and 5 for a complete experience.There are maybe a hundred stalls here serving everything from Apple's to zucchini.Cooked food to eat in or take away, breads, cured meat, honey ,tea,flowers everything actually.When i came here yesterday with my daughter we bought gorgeous dried mango to munch on,we also bought figs. Cheese and spent ages tasting 15 different honeys b4 choosing Orange blossom as our favorite.Get here early as we found the great choice of bread were limited at 4pm.We did see some gorgeous donuts with brilliant fillings at £3 each. But decide to wait for our meal later!There are also retail and eating opportunities around the market so do venture outside to the markets history goes back 1000 years so lap it upNB it's not cheap here. But you knew that would be the case.Nicely it's under cover so even if it's raining you'll be ok.||February 15, 2018
Llubi||40||Love this market have a variety of fruits and vegetables not counting the amount of diversity of food from different places around the world. Is very multicultural Also is located a few minutes walking distance from the heart of the city. Sometimes I find the market messy but I think that is idea of a market right? Fruit and vegetables are very overpriced but you find quality ||February 15, 2018
tripsterDonegal||40||Great place to visit . Stalls had great selection of goods. Food stalls are varied and have lots of interesting food to take away, Very lively place||February 15, 2018

Boro_Steve||50||Borough Market is opposite London Bridge and has to be on every tourists must visit list. You can buy so much top qualoty food there from cheese, spices, olives, fruit, meat, juices, cakes and other sweet goodies and of course hot n cold street food. There are so many stalls selling all kinds of dishes from around the world. You can have traditional fish and chips, roast meats in wraps, grilled cheese sandwiches, Ethiopian and Asian dishes all made fresh in front of you for a fraction of the price you would pay in a restaurant. My favourite is the German deli which serves deliciously huge german bratwurst in a fresh baked roll with mustard, ketchup and sauerkraut. It was £5.50 which may seem dear but the quality of the food makes it worth every penny!||February 13, 2018
Puja T||50||A trip to Borough Market is heady for the senses and a treat for the palate! A motley mix of aromas , gastronome delights donot miss the bakery esp the Fudge and Chocolate stalls . Fresh farm pate’s , cheese and almond brittles. ||February 13, 2018
AgnesH21||50||What a wonderful market, very friendly, happy and helpful people. Amazing smells and sights. The spice stall was like nothing i've ever seen before. Lots of samples on all the stalls. Couldn't make up my mind for brunch, the stall offered paella or chicken curry @ £7 per tray so the gentleman suggested half and half which i did and boy was i glad.||February 13, 2018
bandip||50||Markets narrate the character of cities. Cities are known by the markets that they host.A visit to the Borough Market opposite the London Bridge Station depicts the dynamics of a popular market frequented by locals and tourists alike. U name it and will get. Right from meat to Mexican mirchi, cheese to chocolates,cashews to crocodile meat burger, essence to exotic meats etc etc. When food is there can India be not there,??. Gujarati food and moongdal dosa jostle with Thai pancakes and meat and fish preparations by the side of with huge logs of breads, juices,soups so on so forth. A great place to buy speciality food as also a wonderful place to spend time with friends looking for things from easy to get to exotic. A must visit when one is in London.||February 13, 2018
LauraN135||50||If you’re a tourist I would recommend you visit these markets. We loved walking around and seeing the different food suppliers and of course enjoying the food!||February 12, 2018
James T||40||This place is really a food market. there are a lot of authentic local product, home product (i think), go there when you are hungry.. tips, don't go there by your self, go there with your wife, kids, friends, so you could taste and share more food. near the market there is a local cheese store and it is really tasty. a lot of options and this place is super crowded, and it is outdoor, so beware of the weather..||February 12, 2018
Skeney57||40||I'm not a big shopper or market person but the wife & daughter were adamant so off we went ! Plus I ended up enjoying it ! Plenty of different stalls of all sorts and there is something for everyone , cheese tasting, port, meat etc a lot to enjoy !!||February 11, 2018

825niamhm||50||Have been many times with friends and family. Good way to find interesting or exotic food. Got 12 year old to try kangaroo for the first time. However can get extremely busy in tourist season and food is more expensive. ||February 9, 2018

490grants||50||If you enjoy food then this is a must for your ‘To Do List’.A variety of foods to eat and it’s great just meandering amongst the cheese, seafood and cake stalls amongst others.||February 8, 2018
Jordon H||30||I had a full dressed venison burger here on 6/2/18. This was amazing and worth the £7. Plenty of cured meats on the shelves.||February 7, 2018
EllenChr||40||Definitely a Place to visit on a saturday - but get here early to avoid the lagre crowds. Wether you come to shop or just to look around you´ll be tempted to taste some of the goods. Several nice cafees and a lot of food stalls where you can get all kinds of treats if you`re hungry.||February 7, 2018
ront68||30||This was an evening event that my family and I did just before Christmas. I was amazed by the different types of cheeses and pastries and wined available. There was also fresh fruit and vegetables as well as prepared foods at local restaurants.This would be an awesome opportunity for families, couples, or any individual.||February 7, 2018
Eyekaytoo||40||A number of friends and colleagues had told me that if I was in the area of London Bridge then I should visit the Borough Market. I'm glad that they did. I wasn't really sure what to expect but in reality this is a fascinating cockney market with emphasis of exotic and many organic food stands. In fact you can shop and eat to your hearts content here and, in doing so visit almost all four corners of the world. I really liked exploring the boutique Spanish & Italian stalls and the Cider House was a special treat that needed sampling even late morning. When I discovered the Richard Haward's oyster store I really kicked myself that it was really too early in the day to start eating these delightful luxuries from the shallow creeks of the River Blackwater in Essex. And, as I was only in London for 24 hours or so, it wasn't practical to buy any to take home to Germany. I was intrigued to see how popular this stall was with Asians who had formed an orderly queue to get their fresh weekend shellfish shopping here. If I lived in London this would certainly be a place to head to for that exotic culinary experience.||February 7, 2018
NanaCanicali||50||I loved this small yet charming market. There is fresh goodies and food made locally along with bread and other delicacies. Take your time and enjoy some fresh and local food. I highly recommend eating here.||February 7, 2018
YorkshireTraveller14||50||It’s not possible to work in the area and not have lunch at Borough Market. The street food stalls are amazing - look out for the Indian veggie stand selling dosas and the huge cinder toffee doughnuts from the local bakery.||February 6, 2018
haticee2013||40||If you love food, you definitlly go. Somedays, limited opening for the stores. Soo colorfull, lots of food to try. Deserts, bakery, fish, meat, chinese, noodle....even workshops avalaible ||February 6, 2018

They also have a great selection of food tents which foods from all over the world!On this trip we decided on a roast duck sandwich for myself and my wife had Raclette - the smile on her face told me how much she was enjoying it!! The duck sandwich was unbelievably good - I wish I could go back and get one now!!We spent a small fortune on cheese and chorizo - Cannon & Cannon have the most amazing selection of Chorizo and some of the flavours are so tasty!If you’re in London, go here and sample the atmosphere and try some of the great foods on offer - you’ll not be disappointed!!||February 5, 2018

Alliejc||50||What a great place to visit. After a slightly disappointing trip up the Shard, we thought we’d check the market out. It really didn’t disappoint, despite the pouring rain. So much choice of food, from all the corners of the globe. Yummy! ||February 4, 2018
LeeLee883||50||Best advice I can give is arrive hungry!! There is so much food of all types here that you find yourself salvating at the selection available. Hot food and desserts covered but also amazing fruit and veg stalls. First visit and I can't wait to return, perhaps in the summer for a picnic selection of goodies ||February 3, 2018
887faizak||40||Ok if you are foodie so this is the place to be. From everyday essential raw fruits, vegs and cheese to some deliciously cooked street food, you will find almost everything there. Its an open market so it also gives you a feel of old times and you can envision how London was in its glorious times. Advice: Nerver go there on full stomach.||February 3, 2018
Pete O||50||My wife and I stayed nearby for a business meeting with the RBL and had a look round what we think is an amazing market. The atmosphere is brilliant and all the stalls a joy to browse. We had dinner at Appleby's which was fantastic and breakfast upstairs in a restaurant who's name I can't remember which was the only disappointment as the food was cold which was a shame as it was really good quality produce. We will definitely go back to this market again. ||February 2, 2018
lyndaab1||50||What a delightful selection of food ! Everything you can think of and more. Can be quite busy but this only adds to the atmosphere. Definitely a worthwhile visit.||February 2, 2018

Woodster554||50||Loved walking round here and looking at all the food. I also enjoyed the cider stand. We where tempted to eat here both nights of our stay due to the wide selection of food that they sell. Will definitely return next time I'm in London ||February 1, 2018
Agustina O||50||I went to Borough Market with some friends and them came back with my family, it’s really really good! There’s food to suit every taste, you could really go everyday and eat a different meal because there’s a huge variety. Definitely try the raclette and cheese sandwich from the shop at one of the entrances (there’s always a queue but worth it). You can also buy spices, cheese, bread, pretty much everything. ||February 1, 2018
dant920||50||Wide selection of foods and drink, can get very crowded. Would recommend the donuts at bread ahead bakers||January 31, 2018
alexandracoults||40||This was my second visit to London, and second visit to the Borough Market. I was with my boyfriend and we actually had to come back to check out more of the stalls since it was just closing the first time we went. SO check hours (10-4 usually) before visiting! I came for the raclette stand on the outside, but it is also fun checking out the different booths and stands they have here!||January 31, 2018
heatherogburn||50||You just have to visit this market. It is full of wonderful artisan produce, fresh vegetables, fruit and fish.

Kai-HT||50||Whenever we come to London, we always make time to come to this very busy and bustling market to try something new to eat. Although Saturday is the main market day with the greatest choice, it does get extremely crowded and lines are long. Best to come Wednesday through Friday.||January 30, 2018
diadour||50||Wow, there were endless rows of food, drinks, market fresh fruits and veggies and music. We throughly enjoyed an entire day there.||January 30, 2018
484yvettew||50||Since we'd visited Borough Market on our previous visit, we were sure to pop in again. The desserts and cakes we had were delicious, and we were pleasantly surprised to find biltong at one of the stalls! The market can be a bit pricy, but as a treat it is well worth it and there is something to please every taste.||January 29, 2018
JoshB999||50||This market has foods for every type of person. It is a very quaint open food market, with foods from around the world accommodating vegans, vegetarians and carnivores.||January 29, 2018
allyr0ss||50||Love this place. Will pop in even if I don't need a haircut. Great music on the radio as well. You're treated like a friend rather than a customer. Very reasonably priced as well, for London. Just £19 for a haircut, which is what I was paying in Aberdeen nearly 30 years ago. And I had just as much hair.||January 29, 2018
Rachel W||40||We had a great wander around Borough market on a Saturday lunchtime. Lots of foods to try and we walked around with a glass of prosecco. We has an amazing burger, yummy doughnuts, tried lots of bread and cheese and had a yummy brownie. It was very busy and not many places to sit to eat but overall a great afternoon. ||January 29, 2018
MarOReilly||50||From London Bridge down by the Thames underneath the train tracks, the borough market is a warren of stalls heaving with all manner of food cooked on the spot. What a heady mix of aromas colours and food for the eyes to enjoy! Fresh food stalls are in one area as you walk through and surrounded by small eateries. Foodie heaven! ||January 28, 2018
PEAnderson21||50||We went to Black and blue for lunch and while visiting the area we popped into the market for its exciting range of produce and flavours. Worth visiting for its nostalgic London atmosphere and views of the shard too, a great market full of hustle and bustle and global taste sensation. Street food at its best. A great way to start the New Year of 2018!||January 28, 2018
Angie K||50||Went early in the morning so was just setting up, fascinating array of weird and wonderful food to be had, would’ve loved to go back when it was in full swing and made a purchase or two. Lovely old historic buildings too.||January 28, 2018
MichalisP||50||We found Borough Market by accident during our walk on southbank. Wonderful market which worths the visit. Very nice and a variety of food is served on the market. Nice to see people cooking fresh food. ||January 28, 2018
Patricia C||40||Borough market has changed dramatically over the last years. No lomnger the free for all busy market of old, it has now been gentrified and become one of the main tourist attractions in the ar3a. Snacking stalls, Devon beef and French cheeses are some of the things for sale. One of the best stalls at the moment must be the Spice Mountain. Their knowledge and enthusiasm are amazing.||January 28, 2018
michrobs71||50||This place is amazing. A real assault on your senses but in a good way. The produce is so fantastic and the stall holders very friendly and helpful. There is such a variety of foods to try you really don’t know where to start. I only wish that the weather had been better and I would have happily stayed for hours just grazing.||January 28, 2018

SamNSara||50||Im a huge foodie, this was heaven for me! I had to come by 2 days in a row as there were just sooooo many things I wanted to eat but couldn't fit in my stomach all at once.Venison pie, bread pudding, salted beef sandwich, roast hog, scotch eggs, donut, cheese, bread, sausages, Turkish delight, you name it, I ate it!||January 27, 2018
CheekyLondon||40||Went here to Padella for lunch and had a wander round the market. Always interesting! There are lots of choices for 'street food' and a huge variety of specialist stalls including bread, fish, meat, fruit and veg, wine, cheese, cakes etc etc. Anything to do with food you can fine here - except for the wild boar that we were looking for!! It is expensive but exactly what you would expect in a London market with specialist and high end products. A very good atmosphere.||January 26, 2018
L_K1509||50||We visited for lunch, there is so much choice. Take your time to look around the whole market before making your choice, we had chicken wraps Wyndham house poultry which were delicious and filling.There are foods from around the world and after the savoury there is plenty of options for desserts. It’s does get busy so take your time and look after your belongings.||January 26, 2018
YogaMarianne||50||Something for everyone. Take your time and stroll around until you find something of your liking. Food from all over the world. Busu, crowded and friendly. Great produce to take home. Dont miss the pasta stall or the scallops served on wok vegetables. Finish of with coffee from Mamouth coffee across the street.||January 25, 2018
Lobster84||40||Looking around for somewhere for lunch and stumbled through. Well the food stalls where fantastic and fresh. Public toilet were free and well kept.||January 24, 2018
Ken M||40||Having been to the Shard, I took my wife to see Borough Market. I've always been fascinated with the number of different nationalities and foodstuff contained in this place. An atmosphere of delightful delicacies from herbs to complete foreign dishes creates an amazing aroma to make the mouth water. This place alone can take a couple of hours to wander through and another hour or so to enjoy the Tastes Flavours and Highlights of the food bargains. Really good for cheeses and honey. ||January 24, 2018
sabinoz||50||Just a great place with wonderful stallholders with an amazing variety of foods..enjoyed a plate of raclette for lunch as treat/...will be going back as there are some other food places to visit within the market which were just too busy when I visited||January 22, 2018
absuhr||40||We visited on the worst possible time, there were soo many people so we went and had lunch somewhere else. However all of the shops seemed very nice, and I am sure that you can get some great food. ||January 22, 2018
nwbeach||50||Stumbled across this market accidentally and am glad I did. Great selection of street foods - I ate a pulled pork wrap which had Mac and Cheese and ColdSlaw which was incredible! I also had a chickpea and potato quesadilla. Will defiantly be returning when I am back in London! ||January 22, 2018
ceciliac881||50||It’s a nice market to stroll along and fresh fruits and vegetables. If my hotel has a kitchen it will be no brainer to cook these fruits veggies. They recently opened a bakery School at the end of the market and they have every kind of bread to buy. Very inexpensive and fresh. Right across they have a clam chowder place with a long line. We were told it’s the best but since we were hungry we didn’t wait. Lovely place to visit and easy to get to with the tube||January 21, 2018
DTCNj||50||Everything looks so appetizing and the samples were flowing. Get the onion and chili chutney at pimento hill, so good we went back for more. Got duck sausage with 5 spice, so good. In warmer weather would be here every day!||January 21, 2018
ogri||50||Called in to Borough market on our way home from a few days in London, Fabulous selection of street food from all over the world. Beautiful displays of veg and breads, wish we lived local to this I would visit it regular ||January 21, 2018
P4239YHmariap||50||We love Borough Market, there is always something new to see here.The smell is always really tempting as you walk around.Great stalls for cheese, meat, fish, bread, vegetables.... Everything you could possibly want! ||January 20, 2018
John S||40||Saturday is the day the entire market is open. Everything from fresh, raw, oysters to roast duck salad; grilled scallops; specialty pasta, Singapore noodles, and paella; burgers with beef, lamb, venison, or ostrich; roast pork with crackling; raw sea urchin on the shell; fresh fruits, juices, vegetables, and fish and game; pastry, chocolates, and Turkish Delight; sausages and saucissons; white truffles, wine, cheese, and wine aged cheese; specialty teas and coffees including barraquito; plus a whole lot more.You can also have your hair cut as well although I will admit I haven’t gotten around to that yet.The market opens in the late morning on Saturday and if it is your first time, it is a good idea to go early because once the crowds arrive, your movement will slow to approximately zero miles an hour. If you are coming via London Bridge or the tube station, chances are you will walk through the pastry and sweets area first. There are some grillls and Indian options near the church but there are also many savoury and meatier options further back towards the river (ie heading North). I have been going for years and still have not tried everything. While most of the food seems good, one should still practice good hygiene. Resist the urge to eat picked fruit until you have washed it. Assume cheese is unpasteurised. And avoid the vendors that have no customers (one stall with meat pies in the back in particular - terrible stuff).Also, do yourself and the other visitors a favour and leave the trolleys, suitcases, big backpacks, baby strollers, and small children at home. This is not a kid friendly place as occasionally adults do rush through the crowd bumping into people and the children will never be able to see anything other than adult legs and backs. Also, leave the open toed high heels at home. Your feet will get stepped on. Plus, if you plan to nibble the wares there, most folks just find a corner and eat standing up. This is a jeans and trainers (sneakers) kind of place.As well, if you are pregnant, not only is this not a good place from a stress point of view, this may pretty much be full of inedibles in your condition.But otherwise, enjoy the adventure. Tip: go with someone you don’t mind sharing food with and get just one portion to share. You can try more dishes and stalls this way.||January 20, 2018
GlenG636||50||What a varied stunning array of goods on display, So many cheeses, such a choice of fish,great coffees to buy and on top of that a great greasy spoon traditional London cafe with Tea and a Bacon Roll to die for. Grandchildren loved it to, although had to put up with " Buy buy it Grandad ". Spent a vet lazy pleasant three strolling round the market and left with three carrier bags of goods. Would recommend and will return||January 20, 2018
michaloss||50||I really enjoy places like this. It has awesome atmosphere, mixing all these flavors, variaty of foods and drinks and masses of people. Despite of so many people there you can walk around kind of freely and there are almost no queues. ||January 19, 2018
djw1955||50||Visited on a Tuesday, so the Market was not in full swing, but still really enjoyable to walk around, see the many different produces on sale and trying some which were on offer.Wonderful market to visit, friendly staff and nice friendly atmosphere.||January 19, 2018
Rooftop_Beach||40||We were here on Monday during lunchtime. Nearly half of the food stalls were closed but still a bit busy. Not easy to find a seat to have our food but we prefered walking around while we were eating. Not very cheap but nice to try a bit of everything. ||January 19, 2018
Lexincats||50||Borough Market is a definite hotspot for all foodies out there! It's an indoor venue with a collection of both take-and-go street foods / snacks, packaged foods and fresh produce stalls. The atmosphere is amazing and all the vendors are really cheerful. Even if you aren't keen on getting a bite, the bustling atmosphere of the market and the beauty of the fresh produce are still worth a visit. Definitely wish I had more time to spend there and to properly try all the food available! They are known for selling cheese, olive oil, vinegar, ham... Snacks include goat milk ice-cream, breads & pastries, paella, food from different cuisines... Fresh produce is great in variety with all the common vegetables and fruits to micro herbs and seafood.||January 17, 2018
tony_brown08||40||had a few hours going around the market lots to see and do some of the stalls are a bit pricey but many others very good value also is close to more attractions...||January 16, 2018
bankruptcy||50||What was going to be a short stroll turned into a 4 hour food fest. This market is amazing with many many kinds of foods for sale in stalls. You name it and it appears to be here from mid-eastern to oriental to British. Retail stalls are mixed with food stalls and I defy anyone to walk through this market without purchasing several kinds of foods to eat on the spot. We enjoyed paella, mixed seafood wraps, Thai and a beef burrito not to mention numerous samples of meat and cheese. My favorite was a stall of Turkish foods. The merchants are very friendly and will answer questions.After ruining dinner, we went back to the hotel amazed at the variety in this market and the quality.Please do not miss this market.||January 15, 2018
RomenaFZ||50||Amazing place to know, to eat, to shop.Store tips. I don’t remember the names but you can easily find.- peppers around the world- cheese- pasta (fresh pasta to eat in or take away. Really well made and taste)||January 15, 2018

Tim C||50||I visited with friends as part of a day out in London. The place buzzes with atmosphere, a brilliant range of food on offer, the smells are amazing and stall holders always good for a chat. Great for street photography too. There are lots of good bars local to the area too and a short walk from the Thames and other main attractions such as the Shard||January 15, 2018
307cliver||40||Finding places to go for free with a 12 year old in London is difficult. However this market is interesting for all ages, so many different stalls to look at makes it special.We spent well over an hour wandering around taking in the sights, sounds and smells that are on offer. We tasted lots of free samples, always a hit with kids and bought a couple of things for nibbling on for the rest of the day.Worth a visit.||January 13, 2018
judik||30||Really excited to go here based on the recommendations of friends and the Rick Steves guidebook Since the market was closed on Sunday, went on Sat and sorry to say it was so crowded that we could barely move around and see stuff. Lots of overpriced( IMO) food- well this is London-and interesting stuff but the crowds made me leave after 15 minutes. Too bad I didn’t have a chance to go mid week, my experience may have been different. But maybe not- it’s pretty trendy ||January 13, 2018
196yinyinc||40||Very good place for you to discover cheap but good quality fruit.:) a wide range of food for you to choose, international tasting. Recommend Singapore stand and German sausage one. ||January 13, 2018
McAnnie1||50||W were so sadenned with everything that happened at Borough Market earlier in the year so we were keen to return to show our support. What an amazing food place. We always stop for a glass of rose prosecco & an empenada, it's our tradition & enjoy wandering around looking at the amazing produce wishing we could take more of it home. ||January 11, 2018
Miguel_Sison||30||I was all hyped going to Borough Market since i was reading great reviews of it that when i got there it was a bit disappointing. Food and products were repetative. Found the food that we got there bland and very expensive. Its a rgood expierence but nothing special. ||January 11, 2018
906pd||50||We passed by the market on our way to the tower bridge. It was an amazing surprise to discover a market with such a vast variety of street food and gourmet delicacies. After walking around we decided to try out the Ethiopian food (Ethiopian flavours) and it was AMAZING. We recommend trying the combo of meats you won’t be disappointed. ||January 9, 2018
cassey456||40||Fabulous place if you enjoy variety of foods. Prices are quite expensive but no harm in a little treat. ||January 8, 2018
teoweme||50||Great food, great feel. Love the pork baguette with apple sauce. Used to go all the time. After some food, walk over to Tate modern museum and the river side to walk off the calories. Highly recommend.||January 8, 2018
alicewX2289HO||50||The passageways are filled with cheese, fudge and international foods. Cheap and flavorful food! Enjoyed myself very much ||January 7, 2018
Mavsters||50||We stayed about 2 hours 2-4pm on a Thursday afternoon. As it was quite windy most stalls were packing up at 4pm. Street food was reasonably priced and we visited the on-site pub. ATM if you need cash. ||January 6, 2018
carawasthere||50||Borough Market is one of my favorite places in all of London. Walk around, sampling food and drink... what could be better?! Some of the best food, drink, and dessert is here so don’t miss this market!||January 6, 2018
Red_Bus_Zeal||50||If you are in the London Bridge area, then do stop by Borough Market. You can spend as long or as little as you like, but just walking through is a treat for the senses. If you want to eat? Even better. You can find everything from truffles to jellied eels here.||January 6, 2018
hadasbn||50||I cannot believe the fact that all recommendations I received about london from my friends, did not include this Jem. If it hadn't been for our uber driver that took us from the airport, I would have probably missed it. It's all cuisines from worldwide, very authentic vibe, the food counters or shops are outside but nonetheless and in spite of the cold weather, people buy their meals and eat them outside. Either standing or sitting in some scattered tables. Inside there are also deli stalls selling cheese, bakeries, charcotries. Every kind of food basically! It's really a fun place to come and eat lunch and find an original desert too||January 5, 2018
alhamdank||30||Great market with range of stalls and goods . Freshest food such as cheese, meat, spices, cakes, vinegar, oil and breads.There is something for everyone just take around and try little bit of everything.One thing I don’t like ( crowded)||January 5, 2018
queensrow||50||Amazingly good and I challenge you just to eat only one kind of food!! Salt beef, noodles, cheese, patisserie and everything in between. Also buy stuff to take away and go to the pubs there too.||January 4, 2018
nafisab||40||To me no trip is complete until I get a bit of local flavor. If this is your thing then do make 2-3 hours preferably around lunch time so you can taste/ try & also buy loads of home made produce and other goodies. Besides there are lots of vendors selling food - a total melting pot of cultures. There were English , Greek, Thai , African food stalls and what dazzled me was a stall with two westerners making fresh Dosa’s( a very Indian savory crepe). Highlight - there was a vegan burger stall and something for the sweet tooth! In short something to suit every palate. Tip: carry your own eco friendly bag to take home your purchases. ||January 4, 2018
13Si-Sharon13||50||Huge selection of food stalls just about all offer samples, meat, fish, veg, wine, oil, vinegar, cheese, bread, baked goodies.A variety of food stalls & there is something for everyone.Gets busy lunchtime onwards but its not a problem.Several bars & restaurants around for food & drinks.Go hungry & try lots of everything, buy your fave things some are not cheap but the quality of everything is absolutely top drawer.||January 3, 2018
BelgianKiwi||50||From the beautifully displayed breads, cheeses and veg, to the smells of cheese, fresh seafood or pulled pork. This has place has something for everyone, whether it's just a bite to eat or just shopping. Don't forget to have a chat with the stall holders, its so much fun. ||January 3, 2018
Morticia P||50||Wide variety of foods from different cultures available. Absolutely amazing! Will definitely return!||January 3, 2018
Alexandra L||50||Borough market is a foodies heaven. From the desserts to the olive spreads and empanadas and alcohol--borough market has it all. The crowded streets and amazing smells are welcoming and fun. Try a little bit of everything. ||January 3, 2018
The_Wanderlusty||40||We always come to Borough Market when we're in London. Why? The food here is so good its worth fighting the crowds. Go for the Confit Duck (available on full market days) it is so good it will haunt your dreams. Some other treats not to miss are: Scotch Tails for Scotch Eggs, Pie Minister for tasty Pies (get them Mothership style!) and Bread Ahead Bakery for their DELICIOUS Doughnuts. Bring some cash as some places don't take cards and be sure to mind your valuables as there are mobs of people around. Its worth a visit if you love good food.||January 2, 2018
Biddy50||50||Amazing visit to this famous foodie heaven. it was very crowded. But there is nowhere to sit to enjoy the wonderful variety of cooked foods from around the world. So we did not buy. There are also many tradional meat. fruit & veg market stalls.||January 2, 2018
LucyKate||50||There are bigger markets, and markets with a greater range of stalls and goods, but if what you are after is London's best and freshest food, then nothing beats Borough.From the amazing Neal's Yard Dairy cheese shop just down the street, to the stalls under the giant roof selling fresh berries, opening oysters as you buy them, roasting a whole pig on a spit or displaying their mouth watering donuts and pastries, this is the place to come for a picnic, a feast, the evening meal, or to just sample London's best and freshest.||January 1, 2018
michellerU5526VH||50||This is the perfect place to browse on a lazy, hungry morning. I’ve never seen so much delicious food in one place. It comprises of both street food and food market stalls. Cheese, meats, spices, breads, cakes, drinks - a foodies dream!5 stars without a doubt! ||January 1, 2018
Mel P||50||Second time visiting the Borough Market and it was great because this time we had more time to look around. Shared a curry from one of the food stalls, which was fantastic and also visited the spice stall and came away with quite a few spices Love to go again sometime this year...||January 1, 2018
phagerup||40||I was looking for pork belly to be used in a Norwegian dish, but next year I will bring one from the country of the Vikings. There are plenty of places to take a coffe of a beer. I would have liked to spent more time here, but the porkhide became "the one that got away".||December 31, 2017
kathleen k||50||Had a lovely day rummaging around the stalls despite the rain/ sleet the confit duck wrap was to die for and got to try sea urchin and oysters, my partner got to try London’s famous jellied eels not his favourite but I liked them. It is defiantly foodie heaven and a great place to spend a morning. ||December 31, 2017
mikemcdowell2014||50||Our friends rave about this market so it was first on our Must Do list during our visit to LondonThe place was buzzing with touristsOur friends were seasoned veterans and guided us around with skillFruit Bread Fish Cheese and meat were in abundance from independent suppliersMy Wife particularly enjoyed the Balsamic Vinegars and Olive oil that was on offer to try with bread.The choice of food available was too long to list catering for every culture and tasteVegan and Veggies were also well catered for. We had a juicy handmade burger and were not disappointed at allArtisan products from all over were on offer including Gin and CiderWe were in the Markets for over an hour and thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would definitely return ||December 30, 2017
badmintontim||50||Although this is traditional, the market has changed to meet the needs of the population such as selling Eastern European wares as well as local foodAn eclectic mix of food and other goods especially at Christmastime ||December 30, 2017
mwooduk||40||Just visited Borough market during the Christmas holidays and it was so beautiful. Everybody was in a good mood, tons of stalls, loads of people great food - I just wish there were places to sit down and enjoy the food. Some of the smaller restaurants do have seating areas but the actual stalls could really use an outdoor food court or something along those lines. The pie shop is fabulous as is the cheese and loads of fresh veggies too.||December 30, 2017
TACOB0B||40||We love the market... I mean what's not to love? However, during our visit this weekend our main reason for visiting was the vegetable samosas by Gujarati Rosoi. Yet they seem to be no longer there, very disappointing. We tried the chicken and egg noodles from another booth and although they looked good, skip it! Would we return, absolutely, Borough Market is Great!||December 30, 2017
michellez2016||50||From bakeries to butchers , oysters to game meats , cakes and pastries , olive oil and vinegars, paella and burgers , chocolates and honey. You could taste food all day and experience all of London delights ||December 30, 2017
Nicola P||50||The market was extremely interesting and diverse. I could not believe the visual displays of specialty meats ,vegetables and food to eat there! The market is over 1000 years old but fresh and vibrant!||December 29, 2017
Bellum S||50||This is a busy market. It seems to have a lot of cheese stalls, but also some excellent meat and veg places as well. There are also a lot of street food places selling all kinds of food, from Vegan to German! Highly recommended to visit.||December 29, 2017
Onlyplacesilike||50||I can’t begin to think of how many years I have been to-ing and fro-ing Borough Market. Certainly in the early years there wasn’t much there at all apart from a couple of niche vegetarian restaurants. And now it is a thriving hustle and bustle mainly artisan food market, tucked away just south of London Bridge and with the odd flower shop and apothecary on the side. A unique place where locals rub alongside tourists, picking up a nice loaf of sour dough bread or stopping off for a drink. A classic piece of London not to be missed. ||December 29, 2017
joaobentocn||50||Such an interesting place to visit during your stay in London. It offers a big variety of different options of food from all around the world. It is something really important to see during your stay in London. ||December 28, 2017
katiet165||50||The variety of foods available here is amazing. There is such a variety of different foods from different cultures and all are delicious. From pastries to savoury dishes and also hand made arts and crafts. A great way to spend the day and try out different things. My only regret was booking dinner in a restaurant as I would have happily stayed for longer trying out more food! ||December 28, 2017
wendyurquia||50||An absolute must for any foodie in London. I would suggest going during the week so you don’t have to battle the huge weekend crowds. Put aside at least half a day and plan to have brunch/lunch there. Come with high expectations for quality cheeses and delicatessens, pastries and baked goods, wine, juices, olive oils and of course fresh produce. ||December 28, 2017
matty_norman||50||A perfect place for foodies. There's something for everyone, all types of cuisines with a range of sweet and savoury options. Could spend a long time wandering around and sampling everything here.||December 27, 2017
Trinaandgarry||50||Incredible atmosphere Happy people all around The different types of food on offer is amazing- pure passion in each seller :)Just a lovely vibe any time of the year- however, Christmas felt magical ||December 27, 2017
123maggie1945||40||I live very near Borough Market and always love my visits there. Not the nicest place when it’s very busy ,but otherwise it’s just “ FAB. All the stalls sell very good food ,to eat or take away. Wonderful cheese , fruit,veg.meat and the best mulled wine.||December 27, 2017
Wee Teck T||50||My third trip in 2 years but first trip after the terror attack this year. We were there around 1015 AM and many of the shops were just preparing to open. Got my coffee from Monmouth at 3.10 Pounds and my medium oysters from Richard Howard oyster bar.||December 27, 2017
steph_anndm||50||Great quick bite option. Hard to eat under the rain though glad there are little shades. Options of food and drinks are great.||December 27, 2017
AgentBlonde||40||Borough Market deserves the great reputation it has for fresh produce and unusual or interesting consumables. I love the vibe here. Everyone is so passionate about what they produce and that spills over into good quality. I always find special cheeses here, delicious breads and oddities like award-winning Gin & Tonic Marmalade (great gift for gin aficionados). It's a perfect place to spend an hour or two just wandering around and soaking up a little part of London's big heart.||December 26, 2017
Hatyaiman||50||If you love FOOD, you will enjoy this place for sure. Take a tube to London Bridge station is a good choice for tourist.||December 25, 2017
Daisy L||40||Stop by to take a browse through and plan on trying an assortment of food for lunch. Similar to food carts in Canada but food stands. ||December 25, 2017
Adele S||40||This is a great place to visi if you're in London. It's a market full of great produce from England, and there's also some stalls selling Croatian, Spanish, French local delicacies. But the cheese! Oh my god, I'm in heaven! They sell items to accompany your cheese of course, such as wonderful fresh seafood, cured meats, fresh veg, freshly baked bread, and more cheese. There's also places to get locally produced alcohol which of course goes well with cheese, and they sell fresh paella, soups, and other food which pales in comparison to the cheese. There's some great local pubs surrounding the market too. But they don't sell cheese.||December 24, 2017
Marilyn25CapeTown||50||Great experience. Fabulous atmosphere and the most delicious food to choose from. From hot beef on rye, fried fish and chips to falafel and wraps. You can’t go wrong.||December 24, 2017
MommaAmp||40||So many stalls of food to stand around and eat! Wear comfortable shoes, the floor is uneven cement. A little overwhelming at first, my suggestion is to buy a drink like mulled wine and walk around before deciding what to eat. The options are endless. We had the paella which was delicious. Definitely a must do! Good for all ages but it is very crowded.||December 23, 2017
Reisby||40||It is a great experience to walk around in the market. We had some fresh juice and mullen apple. For lunch I had Wokit, it had a wide selection of ingredients and was delicious. The market is busy but has a great vibe. Worth a visit.||December 23, 2017
nilintentum_reliquit||40||Full of colour, character and charm and you get the feel of a London market. Grab yourself a tea and hot snack. Wander down where the film 'Lock Stock' was filmed plus the Globe pub from Bridget Jones diaries. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.||December 23, 2017
andy s||50||It is always great to be in this place and experience its atmosphere, people, food, the pubs around the area, the river, the great cheese shop ( a must go if you love cheese).This time we booked lunch in a place overlooking the market and its architecture. Will definitely stop again here next time I’m around.||December 22, 2017
bwhyatt88||50||I love food and Borough Markets didn’t disappoint. So many stalls with so many delicious foods, drinks and produce. We stayed around 45 minutes but could have easily stayed longer. Just jump on the tube to London Bridge which is clearly sign posted. To walk off your calories, go and visit London Bridge. ||December 22, 2017

S4549YSdanielb||50||Have visited many times. This time for a pre Xmas treat. You’d be hard pushed to find a better selection of food in London. An amazing selection of fresh produce and with some careful shopping some good value to be had.However overall it won’t be cheap, but quality isn’t.Lots of great food stalls that offer all sorts of interesting and unusual food if you’re hungry.||December 22, 2017
jru2013||50||There is a variety of food from all over Europe and more. There are stalls to buy ingredients as well as cooked food. Very enjoyable||December 22, 2017
Irene M||50||This is possibly one of the most enchanting farmer markets in London. Hidden under the railway you will discover a vibrant island of fresh produce, international gourmet stands and street food. Saturday mornings at its very best. Avoid if you hate colourful, diverse, inclusive places.Slightly pricy, but worth one stop.||December 22, 2017
X8085XIalanf||40||This market is quite unlike those of Goa or Zanzibar. It’s a curious mix of real product sales, often with long queues, and fast food outlets. It’s very busy at most times but well worth seeing. Yes, you can manoeuvres push chairs here with difficulty but hang on to small children. Parking is chronic and toilets hard to find.||December 22, 2017
Hrh68||50||A proper treasure trove,, great buzzing atmosphere, amazing cheeses and spices, great place to buy alternative gifts. All tastes catered for with the amazing food stalls.. mmm.||December 22, 2017
solaodumosu||50||My visit to Borough market was a Deight.It was full of organic and fresh foodstuff.Luscious looking paella , fish and chips etc.It was bustling and busy and had a very exciting atmosphere. It also has a number of good restaurants. It should be a stop on one's visit to London.||December 22, 2017
Peachey333||50||Every sense is delighted and excited with the variety of foods...drinks and people.Spent an hour here today and felt very comfortable just looking and meandering.||December 22, 2017
SirJ0||40||Probably the most interesting market in London, where you can find original and precious food, from truffles to oysters, and ingredients for any kind of cuisine.well worth a visit, next to London Bridge. I suggest to do it after the nearby View from The Shard and eat at Applebee (fish) or Tacos El Pastor (Mexican).||December 22, 2017
bindletravels||50||We came here on our first day in London and we loved the charm of this market. Lots of food selection and is a great place to hang out!||December 22, 2017
fyiow89||50||One of the best market in London with all kinds of local, traditional and fresh food. There are also many good cheese stores sell unique and winning award cheese. I specially like the one made with wine. ||December 21, 2017
MillyMoo03||50||This market is amazing!!! Visited about two days ago with the whole family. We all went in at around 1 without eating the whole day, in anticipation. We all came out like rolling wheel barrows!! The food was incredible - there was so much to offer. The market was incredibly extensive in size both food and range wise. A definite must-see for any food lover out there!P.s. the pork crackling at roast to-go is the best I've ever had!!||December 21, 2017
Suezy2001||50||I've been here a few times now and always for a coffee and brunch.Don't go earlier than 10am (during the week, unsure about the weekend) as people are still setting up their stalls. Maybe dont go there if you are trying to diet because there is just so much good food like cheese, pies, sausage rolls, crepes, paella, seafood, fudge, scotch eggs, cakes, donuts, fresh juices and so much more! A great place to visit. ||December 21, 2017
Jeremy H||50||Our first time to this very old open air market. Wow! If you're a food lover, this is an essential visit. There are hundreds of stalls, featuring prepared foods, produce, meats, poultry, fish, baked goods and sweets. We had a sausage sandwich (oh my, it was delish), pad thai with prawns (also delish), and sampled many items, such as the paella. The vendors were all very generous with samples. (My younger daughter especially appreciated this when we were amidst the sweets... fudge, cakes, pies, candies... yum...) There's also a huge variety of produce, charcuterie, meats, poultry, fish, and baked items. Lots of exotica -- one vendor that specialized in mushrooms was a favorite of our visit, as well as a stall that sold fruits from all over the world. We will definitely return!||December 21, 2017
micdo1||50||Although the dishes are not very cheap, there is a great selection of dishes and types and almost everything that is eaten is very, very tasty. It is best to arrive on an empty stomach on Friday or Saturday morning and just start walking and tasting||December 21, 2017
999LauraP582||50||Got here before the stalls opened, so poor spouse had to hunt for coffee! It was misting so a little cold and damp. We had planned on spending two to three hours here but many of the stalls weren’t openThere are some of the most beautifully displayed fruits and vegetables you have ever seen, makes you want to buy one of everything!Some beautiful mushrooms, truffles and dates along with stalls of fish, oysters, etcMeat departments made you wish for the time and means to roast!Fresh flowers and fresh bread and fresh baked goods at your pleasure!Lucky Londoners for having this market available!||December 20, 2017
820katiee||50||Great place to go even if it is raining as it is mostly undercover. Went on a pretty miserable Sunday and was cheered by the market traders, the bustle and immense variety of produce and differing foods. Partook of some mulled cider which was delicious. We had booked a restaurant otherwise would have eaten there. So much going on!||December 20, 2017
MoritzStiefel||50||Borough Market is one of my favorite places to eat in London. My two favorite stalls, which for me no trip is complete without, are Kappacasein (for delicious toasted cheese sandwiches) and Bread Ahead (for incredible cream filled doughnuts). Neither of those will do much good for your waistline, but at least your taste buds will be happy. And if you're lactose intolerant or gluten free, fret not, there are dozens of other stalls to choose from. I generally travel by myself, but I imagine this would be a good place to go with a family that can never agree on what to eat, since there are so many choices. Just note that it's outdoors (though most areas are covered), and there aren't that many places to sit, so you may have to walk and eat, and depending on the weather, you may be cold. Also, if you have a choice, you might consider visiting on a day other than Saturday, which seems to be the day of the week when it's most crowded.||December 20, 2017
sleepster||50||I have planned trips to London around going here. In fact I have on a number of visits made it a point to stay in accommodations that provided food storage and preparation facilities. This is a place to purchase wonderful fresh foods and well as prepared foods. Stroll around and eat from vendors selling various delightful foods or purchase meats, fish, oysters, breads, vegetables, wine, olive oil, etc from stalls selling local and fresh foods. I have often bought great bred, unpasturized butter and a bottle of wine for a personal feast. I could go on and on about the sensory delights available. If you like food it is a place not to miss. Close to the Tate Modern so eat and walk off some calories by looking at art.||December 20, 2017
867ians||50||Tremendous range of foods on sale for immediate consumption or to take home. Wonderful selection of cheeses, butchery,fish, wines and spices.Could easily spend a fortune here! Great experience though!||December 20, 2017
lozzapie1||50||Borough market is great for all food lovers. If you're looking for something for lunch there are plenty of stalls offering different types of of cuisine. I particularly recommend the fish & chips, scotch eggs and pie stands, but there's also lots of veggie options as well.If you're not after lunch there are plenty of baking, cheese, meat, fish stalls to purchase from, as well as coffee bars and pubs surrounding the market.||December 20, 2017
jonsapon121||50||If yo r a foodie then go on an empty stomach and a partner, so you can taste as much as you can. Thursday and Fridays are the best days ||December 18, 2017
IslandMichele007||50||Great choice of food especially foreign cuisine. I opted for vegetarian thali which was very tasty & reasonably priced. Very busy as it was Christmas. Good atmosphere. Would have stayed longer for mulled wine but had a booking at the Shard.||December 17, 2017
laurieh965||50||Great little outdoor market with lots of choices for all palates and budgets. My family (including kids ages 7 and 9) enjoyed a smorgasbord consisting of freshly made pastas, kangaroo burger, Turkish delights, and baklava all from different vendors we found from our walk. Not a crumb left!||December 16, 2017
fappa_123||50||Borough market is a short walk from the tube station and well worth the visit! London Bridge is the best station to get off at. Some apps will tell you otherwise.The market is teeming with fabulous fresh hot food stalls from all over the globe! Spanish paella? No worries! Thai curry? It’s gotcha covered! Not to mention all you vegan, veggie lovers in between. Wonderful to see over Christmas with all the fabulous lights and garland! A great alternative to the tourist traps!||December 16, 2017
psr1220||50||I did a food tour of Borough Market using a company called Secret Food Tours. It was fantastic. The food was phenomenal. Fish and chips, scotch eggs, sausage rolls. So much good stuff. A must visit while in London.||December 16, 2017
Leon M||50||This was my favourite place in London. The variety of vendors, the quality of the food... a must go.The Brindis Chorizo bun, thr kappacasein cheese toastie and the 'Roast' pork roll were the standouts.Add in mulled wine and it's a winner.A lot of places didn't take card or had a £5 minimum so might be worth bringing cash.||December 15, 2017
fweldon12||50||Do not eat anything before you come here because you need to try anything and everything you possibly can. I’m so happy I took the opportunity to visit this place and explore some brilliant food! ||December 15, 2017
ranchoo||40||You can immediately feel the energy that stirs the foodie in you to dart each market section to take in the sights & smells. We started off with paella & shetland squid ... followed by jellied eel, ostrich burger, tortellini lobster, gourmet goat rice & vegetable bowl ... all were yummy. Other attractions included fresh oysters, mussels, duck confit to name a few. Then there was the full range of cheese from everywhere on full display. You are encouraged to experience for yourself.||December 15, 2017
mr_nor||40||You will be spoilt for choice over in Borough Market. I cant decide anything either and am too full with all the food sold here. Go and have a try!||December 14, 2017
pretty_mtc||40||There are just too many choices around that you need a big stomach to enjoy!We visited this place twice during our 6 days trip!Food are just too yummy!||December 14, 2017
emkandis||50||We have been to this market twice. It is unbelievable. There are so many food stalls and fresh food sellers to pick from. We usually get some fresh fruits and cheese and make that a meal. You could spend a few hours here exploring. Close to Shard, Southwark Cathedral ||December 13, 2017
melissag326||50||Come hungry. Leave happy. Make sure you walk all the way through so that you don’t commit to anything too early. So many types of food from Asian to Egyptian to French. Lots of duck and sausage options. Didn’t see many drink vendors but there were water fountains. Plenty of bakeries and treats. On the outskirts you will find more sit down restaurants and non food vendors. Limited seating but most people are standing and stuffing their faces. No judgment zone. ||December 12, 2017
Andy N||50||Love Borough Market, always busy, better to go a little late on as the crowds die down a little, lots of food stalls really amazing, so much near by,lots of pubs to !! easy to get to, this is a must visit for anyone going into London !!!||December 11, 2017
jen1629||50||A nice walking place by any buses (depending where do you stay) and by tube. Once you have arrived the bus station, walk across the bridge and on your left, you can see London Bridge Tower and right is Borough Market by walking down the stairs. It was amazing seeing so much of different kind of food. Taste it with your friends and family. Coffee, meat, bun, juices, cakes, & etc. Variety and some cute. Besides is a church. Visit it!Go to Borough Market in the morning as it will closes at noon. I love the food and choose wisely on F&B you wanted. You can never go wrong. Seafood cook on the spot after you select it and pay for it. Quite an experience here. Safety is the key too. From this place you can walk to many places. Watch out my other places post in TripAdvisor that could help you explore more. ||December 10, 2017
Helen B||40||Such a mixture of amazing sights, sounds and tastes. Bustling, energetic and a grest variety of food to please all tastes.||December 10, 2017
dartmoor-pony||50||I could have spent so much here. Amazing selection of food, drink and flowers.The few bits I did try were of such good quality I look forward to returning. ||December 10, 2017
944benjaminh||40||Super nice place with lots of different shops to visit. Great to taste different cuisines. Tested vegan burger that might be the best I've tried so far. The crackling suckling pig you might avoid looks great but when you get it is not that great.Would recommend to visit ||December 9, 2017
Bruce J||40||Looking for somewhere relatively cheap to eat on a rare visit to London. Borough Market is a really good place to find a broad choice of cuisines. Queues can be long at the obvious times but the aromas are enticing and in my limited experience the food is tasty and portions generous. The atmosphere is cosmopolitan and friendly. Lots to do within 15 minutes walk. Easy to get to from the big mainline stations.||December 8, 2017
568ashleyr||50||Such a great variety of food! Wish we could have tried so many more things but we were stuffed! Close to London Bride underground station. ||December 8, 2017
Carlton R||40||We visited Borough Market when we were in London. I loved walking around this market and enjoying the sights and sounds not to mention all the samples. It's right next to the Thames river. Well worth the walk around to see all the vendors and enjoy the vendors.||December 7, 2017
Ted K||50||This market is incredible, it's been around since 1756 and there are loads of booths where you can check out anything from gifts to food to beer. Also many restaurants and pubs around. Loved just walking though and checking everything out. Very interesting!||December 7, 2017
PatrickCA15||50||Came here numerous times during my one week visit to London. You can definitely enjoy cheap and delicious lunch here! Sooooo much variety to choose from! The must tries are: 1) meat pies from Pieminister; 2) Scotch Eggs from ScotchTails; and 3) Fish & Chips! Highly recommended!||December 6, 2017
Esme T||40||Had a great afternoon walking round the market, very casual and fun. Loads of interesting food and drink stalls as well as a few trinkets/clothes stalls. The only thing I would say is that it says it closes at 5 but most of the stalls had stopped selling stuff at 4:30.||December 6, 2017
Hols2014||50||A really interesting market- not cheap but unusual produce and excellent quality. Plenty of freshly cooked food too. Lovely cheese stalls and the 'Tea Man' was very helpful. Great breads and preserves. An excellent spice stall is located at the edge of the market - even found lemon salt! A great place to spend a couple of hours.||December 6, 2017
seanworc||40||Borough Market is a widely popular market for food and drink just over the London Bridge in South London, Southwark. It is often packed with both locals and tourists. Many, many kinds of foods to choice from. Visitors can pick and choose their favs from a long list of candidates. There has been a market here for close to 1,000 years. Nearby Southwalk Cathedral goes back to 606. The Market has had a real renaissance with the resurgence and prosperity of London. A must do. Easy walk to the Tate Modern or the Globe from here.||December 5, 2017
elizapitcairn||50||Markets are so fun and exciting. I love the sounds and smells and hustle and bustle. This market did not disappoint. It has everything. And everyone was so nice!! I will definitely return. ||December 4, 2017

Starfish6659||40||Great little market, selling mostly food. Stopped off for a sandwich, which I must say was possible the best sandwich in the world. Also stopped off for a hot cider which was fantastic. Worth a visit if you like fresh produce of all kinds.||December 4, 2017
streakey||50||This is well worth a visit both day and night. Beautiful architecture. Lots of nice restaurants at night. Easy to find.||December 4, 2017
HR8283||40||You can enjoy several treats by jumping from one store to another from different countries and tastes. There are also some benches if you want to eat your food. A good idea if you were in the area and wants a quick bite||December 3, 2017
Helen T||50||I wish we had longer to spend here on our trip to London. We were there about half hour before closing time on a Thursday but we still managed to sample a fair few things. Just a joy to wander round and smell all the smells and see all the spectacular foody sights.||December 3, 2017
Rachel M||40||Stall holders are friendly and often willing to let you taste their wares and also very knowledgable about them. Especially if you like cheese, there are lots of stalls. It is a busy market so tricky if you have a stroller or luggage, and it isn't dog friendly.||December 3, 2017
dannhev||50||We went just for a walk around to pass some time. Amazing place for. Food lovers endless choice and amazing selection of meats, fish, cheese and sweet treats! ||December 2, 2017
Chris B||50||great pre-Xmas atmosphere in this bustly london market. Great street food, we had ethiopian pulled lamb with rice and slaw, yum!||December 2, 2017
DoctorVonCueBall||30||12.2.17Went here today from Gatwick and must say compared to Reading Terminal Market in Philly, Pike in Seattle this one is interesting to walk around but simply average. Worth it for exercise but food, wares, goodies are simply not at the level of Philadelphia.the Doctor hit me with some LOVE ❤️ and a helpful VOTE!||December 2, 2017
profjoypc||50||This is definitely a 'must visit' place in London if you like the atmpsphere of markets and trying all manner of ethnic foods and produce. It is a large, lively, vibrant place which houses stalls selling every kind of food and ingredient you could imagine from diverse places. It is also a good place to sample street food, and to acquire gifts of interest. Apparently the market has existed in some form or another for over a thousand years and today it is one of the most famous food markets (one could argue the most famous) in the UK. It is right by London Bridge and the Shard so there is plenty to do and see in the vicinity. With so much food available here it can be the centre of a wonderful day out on the South Bank.||December 2, 2017
324semia||50||Cool market a lot of different foods from almost all over the world. Can highly recommend this place. Make sure u have a lot of hunger when u go they. They market ist separated by a a street one side is more quiet and easy to miss.||December 2, 2017
Curious742836||50||Small but amazing market in the middle of London. Lot of food from all over the world, just in front of London Bridge station, next to the shard. Wow!||December 1, 2017
mansireddy||50||Borough market has so many stalls selling fresh food and drink. There is cheese, meat, roast pork, pastas, ice cream to name a few. Go with an appetite and a big wallet as temptation can get the better of you.||November 30, 2017
sweetservice||50||Great place to pick up unusual Christmas gifts this time of year, can recommend the stall that sells all the spices if you are into cooking. Loads of great street food on offer and some great little bars too. ||November 30, 2017
Onedogonthebeach||50||First time visit to this very special London market.However we made a basic error by booking in for lunch at a nearby restaurant. There is so much variety of good food on offer to buy taste or eat you should go to this market hungry to enjoy fully The full range of international produce is available under one roof. Next time we will know that and go ready to sample the delights on offer.Highly recommended ||November 29, 2017
JTW202||50||Borough market is a must for foodies. There are numerous stalls from various countries selling cheeses, fresh fish and meats, delicatessens etc. There is also a large number of hot food vendors with an almost impossible choice of offerings. Nana Fannys offer a salt beef sandwich which is awesome and very nice. Eateries abound with various choices from fish and chips to pizza and just about everything in between. Very close by is the Globe theatre and Golden Hindu which are also worth a visit. ||November 29, 2017
lovebeach7878||40||A market for food. You can sample the cheese, meat and olive oil. Wide selection of olive oil and cheese. Caramel salted honeycomb doughnut £3 was great. Fresh oysters at £10 for 5.||November 29, 2017
Cheryl B||50||Passed through on a walking tour, returned for lunch. Could've stayed longer, lots of browsing to be had. Atmospheric location under bridges. Lots of food choices and shopping stalls. Fish and chips voted Londons best. Free restrooms but not near enough seating.||November 28, 2017
Dani718||50||This is the most fun you will have with food. There are so many offerings to sample that it is wise to make a tour of the whole place before you start eating your way through the market...There is not much seating available, but most of the food you will buy can be consumed while walking.Our favorite were the oysters, middle eastern and Asian. The French food offerings left us unimpressed.We enjoyed trying the goat milk ice cream that proved to be very tasty and light.We left with cheese and bread to feed a little army....||November 28, 2017
PanosPPP||40||The Borough Market is right next to Soutwark station. It is a collection of stalls mostly offering food from all sorts of cuisines but also offering some fresh meat cuts, vegetables and other stuff. A very vibrant and packed place located at the foot of the Shard tower. Definitely an experience to be had in London and would recommend trying out something from the food stalls. Very tasty street food.||November 28, 2017
northants90||40||Even when closed this place has a real nice feel to it and a pleasant smell that lingers. The market is indoors and has a lot of stalls offering a range of goods. Even if not shopping it is well worth visiting. The old market is a real Southwark feature. ||November 27, 2017
Johnnycool1954||50||Hustle and bustle, all kinds of street food cooked and assembled in front of you. Great fun and an experience.||November 26, 2017
JKMackem1974||50||Had been planning to visit this on my many visits to London. Glad I finally made it. Well worth it, busy, loads of fab stalls, the atmosphere and smells just wow.

Eileen049||50||We stumbled here after visiting the View from the Shard and wondered around the deliciously fresh produce for sale here. We had a take away lunch from the Ethiopian stall which was mouth watering could eat there every time. There is so much more to choose from and all unbelievably cheap. ||November 24, 2017
Geoffrey S||40||What a market! every corner you turn there is a mouthwatering temptation, from the fruit and veg to the fish and meats, wine and ales, what a variety to choose from. Then there is the street food area with a vast array of tastes from around the world. The whole area is a hidden gem! With cafes restaurants and pubs in abundance. A must visit!||November 23, 2017
joolzroz||50||Never been before, after walking miles around London sightseeing - we headed to Borough Market - what a fab place, so many food stalls - we had a great breakfast at our hotel & wish we hadn’t because we weren’t hungry which meant we couldn’t sample any of the gorgeous food being sold! Atmosphere was electric, so many great restaurants I would defo look to stay in that area for a change when we go to London again, plus the Shard is just around the corner for a visit too!||November 22, 2017
DebSum||50||A lovely place to spend time finding delightful foods in great surroundings. Tasters galore too. Recommend a visit! ||November 22, 2017
Puneite_10||40||This market has an old world feel where the butchers, cheese and fish sellers offer you freshest of their wares. We sampled different cuisines and also had mulled wine while watching various shops.||November 22, 2017
paguar||50||Had a lovely afternoon walking around the market, everyone who visits London and loves food should go. Friendly and welcoming every stall we visited was a delight.Had a lovely glass of wine at Bedales, highly recommend. Also had an awesome duck confit sandwich.||November 21, 2017
jeffb293||50||I've made a visit to the Borough Market a required activity on each of my visits to London. It sure has changed over the past 10 years, shifting more from a traditional market to adding more artisanal stalls to loads of great restaurant stands. All versions are still there as the market and surrounding neighborhood seems to continue to expand. We visited for lunch twice, exploring the market one day and just swinging by for some grub the other time. Incredibly popular and a true experience of the cool part of London.||November 20, 2017
mizmir||50||We stumbled over this Market on our way from our hotel tho the Shard for an event. Our curiosity was awaken by all the smells and also the buzzing of all the people. Wagyu burgers veggie marked and exotic cheeses and meets. The pastries was another story. Heaven for foodies :)||November 20, 2017
KMR139||40||You’ll get jostled and knocked but it all adds to the eclectic mix of people going to the market. Could really do with more places to sit down even at a bar or whatever as a lot of the food is difficult to eat while holding the container (I appreciate there is always the option of the spectacularly over-priced food at Roast).There really is something for just about every dietary preference going. Many of the stalls don’t serve drinks so that’s a bit frustrating.Lovely place to go but I think better when it’s a little warmer out.||November 20, 2017
Trailblazer07||40||A large area of all different vendors and types of foods. Enjoyed looking and sampling. Stand and eat. Plenty of options. Plenty of atmosphere. Glad we visited. ||November 18, 2017

Henry W||40||- Friendly shop keepers- Good and comforting food- Very reasonable prices- Great variety from across the world||November 18, 2017
Marcos M||50||Let's start by saying yes this place is a foodie heaven,they have indian,lebanese,french,british,chinese,cuisines and many more,you can spend 1.5-2 hrs just looking around,plenty of free samples,only drawback is very limited seating,easy too find,near London bridge||November 17, 2017
Blessed06||50||Immediately after ensconcing myself in my hotel, I took the tube to the London bridge station to get food for my room while on my London holiday. I purchased cheeses, bread, cookies and olives. Great quality and very tasty, though not inexpensive. The cheeses where exceptional. I spent only 45 minutes there, but should have been there earlier and purchased more variety.||November 17, 2017
Robbie125||50||Stunning market, the smells greet you walking down the street, the setting is amazing, the freshest seafood, vegetables, stunning butchers, cheese stalls, a must visit for foodies! Had a chilli squid meal , it was divine, difficult choice with the selection on offer.||November 17, 2017
Jim R||40||A trip to borough market was something we always wanted to do but never seemed to get there until last Monday. The whole flowing, bustling atmosphere creates a rush that makes you want to sample everything there and then.You stroll from stall to stall trying to take it all in,So much choice so round and round you go. Wonderful.||November 16, 2017
Karen S||50||The ambience, aroma and atmosphere make Borough Market such a special place. We could've spent a fortune!! (The cheese toastie from Kappacasein was gorgeous). There's an element of refurbishment happening. It'll be interest to see the finished product.||November 16, 2017
Steve L||50||Having just spent three weeks in Spain, it was interesting to visit this particular part of London... a food-lovers paradise, plus good coffee and chai!Unfortunately flying back to Canada tomorrow and no place to cook otherwise I would have stocked up on lamb, sausages, and artisanal cheeses.||November 16, 2017
cdkassotis||50||This is a must-do when visiting London, in my opinion. Head there when hungry, and you'll be greeted with a whole bustling market of craft food vendors selling everything under the sun - fish and chips to pies and pasties to international fare, etc. Grab some food to eat while you wander, and then check out the various shops and stalls selling quality meats, cheeses, pastries, sweets, beer/wine, etc. Grab a glass of Sangria to enjoy while you wander. Loved this place, you could easily spend a few hours there. Make sure you check it out!||November 15, 2017
Fvj52||50||I had heared about borough market by all my favourite chefs on tvAnd when I wen there with my daughter thought I would catch atleast one !Borough market is decorated so beautifully But there are other great markets which also are good in london Worth seeing what the fuss is about on tv ||November 15, 2017
May9938||50||When in London, this place is a must stop for me. The produce from seafood, meat, cheese, breads, vegetables and fruits are a feast to the eye. There's lots to sample from as well so go with an empty stomach if you can. The mussels are fantastic!||November 15, 2017
kevinret13||50||Food. Food everywhere. Tasty food everywhere. That's all there is to say about this market. Should just rename it to Glutton Market. ||November 13, 2017
DangerousPaddy||50||What a lively and exciting market place with so many great traders. I was so impressed with the offerings. If I only I could afford the products. Great place.||November 12, 2017
jack m||50||A trip to borough market was something always been recommended and it was for good reason. The whole flowing, bustling atmosphere creates a happiness that makes you want to sample everything there and that's an almost achieveable goal with the amount of people sharing their wares from cured meats, to cheese and anchovies.Myself and my cousin went for the Ethiopian mixed dish, the bright veg sides adding a nice cool taste. The split pea Dahl is to be sought after.So much for your money too, very big portions. I would turn down every burger there to eat this again. ||November 12, 2017
hevax||50||We popped through as we were staying in the hotel one road away and I was a very good market. If you love good food go here, there is a subway stop right in front of it.||November 11, 2017
Andrew F||40||I find most South on London Bridge news Borough Market has a cut through got something good to eat on the way through all those a little expensive and it can be a bit of a tourist trap it is now recovering quite nicely after the London van incident near London Bridge||November 11, 2017
henchcook||40||Having seen this place in the tv and it having been recommended to us we thought it was worth a visit whilst in London, especially as we are foodies.Lots of choice especially cheeses and hams and specialty foods. A bit touristy for us although there are some little gems in there and the folks are all pleasant and welcoming. If I were to recommend one thing it would be the small cheese place as you enter the market that does cheese toasties and raclette. Oh my word how good they are. Very decadent and full of calories but oh so good especially on a cold day. Try them I dare you!||November 11, 2017
siobhanm855||50||I don’t think I have the words to explain just how good Borough Market is!!! From locally sourced food and drink, to the finest quality European produce. Cheeses, meats, vegetables, beers, wines, breads, cakes... OMG how I managed to leave the market without spending my whole months salary ... I just don’t know! The USP of the place, are the stall holders and staff... all so friendly, knowledgeable about their products and provenance of the items on their stalls... Always willing to offer a sample! Just brilliant ... really brilliant!Take the family Take friends Go enjoy ||November 10, 2017
LisaC241||50||Signed up for a walking tour of this wonderful market on our last day in London. It was great. We sampled bacon egg sandwiches, fish and chips, cheeses, wine, and ended with dessert and tea. I would love to visit again with no time restraints to actually do some shopping. It was by the London bridge and easy to navigate. ||November 10, 2017
Dressagegirl73||50||Stumbled upon this food market (mainly) on the way back from The Shard. Totally interesting with all kinds of food and drink - wish I had been more hungry because the breads looked FANTASTIC. A must - super fun to browse!||November 9, 2017
ruthvl1971||50||Yes it can be busy, yes it is expensive compared to your local market but the experience of visiting is amazing. A wide variety of food is to be found here, some local, some from further afield but all adding to the overall sights and sounds of the market.||November 9, 2017
TravelBrianCO||50||Great market selling fresh and local foods. Just about everything you can think of to eat. They are right off the London Bridge tube station so easy to get to. Definitely suggest eating a meal here. ||November 8, 2017
Troy M||40||Don't visit here if you are hungry. Everything that you can imagine is for sale here. Very busy place. A bit hard to navigate with the amount of foot traffic. Everything looked great, and the food is amazing. Definitely can cure your cravings here.||November 8, 2017
imathi||50||A big market with an international offer. Do not miss tasty street food. So yummy.The largest selection of fresh fruit and vegetables from all over the world, as well as meat and fish.I recommend a small shop Taste Croatia.‍||November 8, 2017
SueN0501||50||We were taken here by a couple of friends that we were staying with for the weekend. A great experience. So much to see and plenty of food to sample especially gorgeous cheese. One of our party had a plate of oysters and I can honestly say I have never seen somewhere like this before. They only sold oysters of various sizes and numbers and there was a long queue so if you like oysters try here. Plenty of places to eat and drink. Plenty of stalls to buy fresh produce from cheese to fish to fruit and vegetables. Definitely worth a visit and I will go back.||November 8, 2017
KuanWai||40||There is a wide range of food to choose from and it's quite quirky how it's all laid out. It's a covered market but come lunch time it is bustling and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable. Even if you don't go for food just go and have a look round. It's an attraction as well as a food market.||November 8, 2017
Albert G||50||Walking around Tower of London and then over London Bridge. We stopped for a quick bite at this stall. A great paella with Chorizo and a steak baguette that was divine. Very reasonable prices and a glass of mulled wine made it a memorable interlude before trekking across the Millenium Bridge to St Paul's.||November 7, 2017
Michael B||40||Our first visit here on a very busy Sunday morning. The range of food stalls selling every kind of street food is amazing but it is a bit of a tourist attraction and some of the prices are very expensive. There are lots of quality produce stalls as well, meat, fish, vegetables, cheese etc. but it’s a great place just to wander around, have a coffee, and soak up the atmosphere.||November 7, 2017

Tractorbeeb||50||Another visit to borough market just ahead of lunch. Perfect day - pop into the Monmouth for best latte for miles, nip over to gastronomical for the best piadina ever!!Then bakers for a giant pain aux raisin to wash up.Delish....Can’t wait til next time||November 6, 2017

David P||50||Took my 14 year old son for the 1st time and he loved the cosmopolitan feel of the market. So many stalls selling street food at reasonable prices also bought a quarter loaf of bread which cost £3.50(£14.00 whole loaf) bit expensive but tasted great.||November 6, 2017
Eilidh M||50||I visited Borough Market on a Friday afternoon in September. The market is vast and hosts a mix of street food stalls and fresh food produce to buy. We went down for lunch and were impressed by the interesting array of options on offer – Thai, Ethiopian, Spanish, Indian, Barbeque etc – there was something to suit all tastes and palates. In the end we opted to try the paella from the Spanish stall and Macaroni Cheese from the cheese stall. Both were hands down some of the best street food we have had – so would definitely recommend. We were able to grab a small table outside as the weather was nice and ate our food over a couple of beers – a very relaxing (despite the crowds!) way to spend an afternoon in London. Would also recommend having a wander around the market as a whole – overall a great atmosphere and a good place to pick up some interesting food to take home with you too.||November 6, 2017
Seena_Joy||50||An amazing place to be for a good lover. One will simply fall in love with the vibrant vibe of third place. Variety of food ware is on sale. Would recommend any visitor to London to try it out. Keep in mind most of these markets in London shut down at 5pm||November 6, 2017
kerckhofj||50||Love this place. Food is always delicious. Would definitely recommend the hummus and olives! As well as the bread. It all looks and taste delicious. It is mostly very busy, but even then it is nice and you just have to go and check it our for yourself!!! ||November 5, 2017
twoknowtheway||50||Busy doesn't even begin to describe this market. Definitely worth to walk around and see the differ t food stalls. The stalls of fresh fruit and vegetables were beautiful! Walk around and sample things and go back for what you want. Best to avoid mid day, too many people! ||November 5, 2017
Alittlebitdaisy||40||There's so many different types of delicious food to try. Make sure you grab a Turkish coffee and a few cubes of Turkish Delight. We always stop by to stock up on Christmas gifts. ||November 4, 2017
827martinob||50||This place is always buzzing with a great variety of stalls and beautiful produce from all over the world and what makes it special is all the eateries and nice pubs all around it .||November 4, 2017
gmbklm||50||Despite the tourists & hot takeaway food, Borough Market is just about hanging onto some great fresh produce stalls, albeit dwindling - Fab fresh fish from Paul @ Sussex Fish, Wyndham House for wonderful poultry and game, Furness for great venison & game, Ginger Pig & Rhug Estate butchers, Oliviers bread, Bread Ahead donuts, Konditor & Cook for delicious brownies and cakes, Monmouth coffee, Isle of Wight tomatoes and Chegworth Farm grown soft fruit & veg. Plus lots of lovely cheese at Mons, Neals Yard and others, plus cured meats.Very sadly, the fresh produce market is being slowly killed off by tourists plus local office workers wanting easy to buy (and high margin for the stall) takeaway food. Has become particularly bad in the last 3-5 years. We've been shopping here for 15-20yrs. Many visitors don't seem to appreciate that most stallholders are small businesses that need to make a profit. They're not Civil Servants. Taking food samples with no intention of buying, or just taking photographs won't pay their rent ! I'm afraid its called freeloading. And Borough Market management don't help, doing their very best to discourage fresh produce customers from shopping at the market. Will there be much fresh produce in 5-10yrs ? I'm not hopeful. As Borough Market becomes a hot food and photo opportunity tourist mecca, we increasingly shop for fresh produce Saturday 9am-2pm Spa Terminus (Nathan's The Butchery, England Preserves, Mons & Neals Yard cheese, Bread Peddler, Monmouth Coffee), & some Druid St stalls / shops, plus every Sunday morning there is a very good fresh produce market off Marylebone High Street (in front of the Ginger Pig shop). Better places for hot food takeaways are the stalls down Ropewalk / Maltby St (off Tower Bri Rd) on Saturdays and Sundays, plus lots of under arches breweries. Maybe also try nearby Mercato Metropolitano down Borough High St or Flat Iron Square on Union St ? Both very nearby.||November 4, 2017
tony c||50||You can't come to London and not experience walking around the Borough Market. This has been around for over 500 years apparently and is likely the inspiration for farmers markets throughout North America. You could spend weeks sampling all of the fare offered here from farm goods to seafoods to restaurants and pubs of all stripes. It's very busy on the weekends, but well worth a visit and a fantastic way to wander a day away. Imagine that kings, queens and commoners have all set foot here over the centuries. Very cool.||November 4, 2017
Kendra D||40||Visited around 1pm on a Friday afternoon, it was very busy but moveable and still enjoyable. We came to have some lunch and look about before going off to St Paul's Cathedral. So much choice of food, it's unbelievable, lovely smells coming from everywhere. It was so hard to make a decision of what to eat. After walking around a few times and finally deciding on a Lebanese wrap it was a good choice as it was delicious as I'm sure all the food was here. Worth visiting. ||November 4, 2017
Rachel B||50||Tons of fresh produce and cheese and bread stands galore as well as countless food shacks with every imaginable culture and cuisine present||November 3, 2017
keithlky||40||This is a really great market in London to shop for goods and to just food hunt for delicious cuisines.||November 3, 2017
LFG08||40||A very scenic market, with aerial railways over your head, easily accessible via London Bridge station, and a perfect start for a walk on Thames bank to either Tate Modern or Tower Bridge. Plenty of food shops, certainly beautiful and ideal for wandering in the past, but a bit overpriced if you aim to have lunch here. For this, prefer the George pub, a few meters outside and so typical. ||November 2, 2017
Snot_Finder||50||The food is of great variety and all that we tried was very good. This history of the place is also quite interesting and goes back centuries. I don't think we could go back to London without a visit.||November 2, 2017
Ksaket||50||Went today with my wife today the food selections were so much that we tried them like hungry animals. Really a must go place for street food & drinks ... i love it ||November 2, 2017
43sharon43||40||The market is not big so it can be cover in 2 hours The place will remind you old london You will find different sorts of food to all tastes from many origins Worth a visit and come hungry do not hesitate to grab small different dishes the price is not high at all||November 1, 2017
DP49||50||Borough Market is immediately south of the London Bridge and well marked. While this started as a market for produce, fish, meat, cheese, bread and more, the food stalls offer a fabulous selection of dishes from around the world. It took me around three circuits before I settled on a Thai Spicy Duck Wrap with Hoisin Sauce. The lunch-size portion was very generous and tasted great. Unable to resist dessert, I strolled past a variety of booths before selecting a tasty Cherry Crumb Square. I was almost tempted to have a second lunch but decided a return visit would be a better choice.||November 1, 2017
daschpitch||50||Borough Market is a large indoor-outdoor market with beautiful displays of local foods and flowers. The booths offer everything from local meats, cheeses, fruits and vegetables to baked and prepared goods. It is a must visit destination. Arrive hungry. So much to choose from. ||November 1, 2017
wexfordflyer||50||Highly recommend heading here to chill for a while and soak up the atmosphere. There's a fantastic array of food available, you really will have difficulty choosing what to eat. Plenty of fun, cool places to have a drink also. And it's just a really cool, chilled vibe in general so nice to spend some time here. Highly recommend!||October 31, 2017
siranthonyd||40||This is a good place to waste a few hours. It is mainly food dominated which if you are not into food could be a problem. However It has atmosphere and is enjoyable. I liked rambling round the stands and the smells and noises were great. It was busy and could be too busy for some. (This was a sunny December Saturday) However take your time. Don’t let yourself be jostled and simply enjoy the visit. It should be on your places to go when in London. ||October 30, 2017
markchesterton||50||This was our first, but most definitely, not our last visit to Borough Market. The smells of food cooking, ingredients, cakes and fresh produce were wonderful. The noise and hustle was that of a proper market. Perhaps not ideal if you had mobility issues, it is level but very busy and care would be needed. We went on a Saturday and were quite disappointed the next day at it is only open on a Sunday during December so lesson learnt there. All-in-all a new must visit for our next London trip.||October 30, 2017
Stevethesweets||40||Went a couple of times in august whilst in the area and as a market selling food it's hard to beat but the prices are very much on the high side but most of london is so you have to accept it . Very crowded but worth it||October 30, 2017
kristof2469||40||Walking from Tower Bridge to Westminster this is one of the 'must do' visits. A food market with tastes and smells from all around the world, the hustle and bustle of market traders and visitors makes for a lovely experience - recommended. ||October 30, 2017
pauljkiwi||50||As never have been to the Borough Markets we ventured over there & was pleasantly surprised on what was on offer.The best time is to come just before Lunch & try to beat the crowds.This place is very popular with the Tourists & Locals.There is every imaginable cuisine for the tasting.The Borough Market sits just below the Shard so make that the landmark to aim for & you will just follow the crowds.Closest Tube is "London Bridge"||October 30, 2017
jenny i||50||Great place for all types of food, something for everyone and plenty of freebies on offer to try something new. Proper London tradition and packed at lunch times. Great atmosphere and the stall holders are all knowledgeable and friendly||October 29, 2017

grandma648||50||This market just comes to life with its hustle and bustle and its lovely market traders. It has culture and food which is just gorgeous and something for everyone. I love it here but it was very busy today and so more difficult to manouver but its just such a lovely place to see. The market life is hard work but its also iconic......I bought lots of food and saw lots of things and will return to it as soon as possible||October 28, 2017

608taff||40||Whenever we have visited London, we have always seemed to get our days wrong and found the market closed so this was our first visit. We were there just before lunch.We will definitely return again. Spice shop was amazing and assistant was very helpful. Coffee was lovely and whole experience was a real delight for food lovers. Just having the option to wander In a pleasant atmosphere without being pressured by sellers is a real benefit. Thai street food was superb but all the food stalls looked appetising. Plan for at least an hour there.||October 27, 2017
TeamWard||50||If you are hungry and anywhere near Borough market and can find something you like then you are a fussy eater, there is so much variety and choice, all very reasonably priced and lovely charm to the place.||October 27, 2017
fionav_12||40||It's a small market. But loads of food to eat and to take away. Do come with an empty stomach.After eating you can take a nice long walk over the boardwalk towards the house of parlement and the big ben.||October 27, 2017
sirmark1956||40||Great place to walk around and take in the smells and sights of the food. What to buy , or try ......the choice is vast All stall holders where welcoming and friendly, just ask to try a sample and they will oblige ||October 27, 2017
Linda S||50||Couldn't get better. Fresh oysters chucked for you to eat at a standup bar table. Butchers meats cut to your liking. Baking school at a actual bakery where you can buy breads, cakes, etc. Fish served fresh from the ocean, great displays of vegetables, fruits, meats, restaurants galore. So exciting around every corner. All sorts of places to both eat at or take home. I could have gone there every day.||October 26, 2017
Lilli E||50||The first time we went here, it was by mistake. But oh my, so much delicious food and treats. Had to go back the last time we were there.||October 26, 2017
Tina N||40||We wandered around the market yesterday, it is a place we often go to. Being a Wednesday over half term it was very busy and a lot of the stalls were open. There are a number of places to eat in the market and a good selection of hot and cold food, The salted squid and paella are always a good bet. The off cuts of the iberico are worth getting in Brindisa (great in a pasta dish) and I also picked up some cheese from Neal's (which is just outside the market but always worth a visit). For a great xmas present the spice shop in the market do a fabulous deal on silver spice boxes and you can choose which spices to include at under £24 I thought this was a real bargain. Plus some of the spices are usually difficult to find in other shops so you have to order them on line normally,||October 26, 2017
Motley2112||50||BrilliantEverything is amazingMore fresh food than anywherePubs great, atmosphere superbCheck out the cheese shop||October 25, 2017
williamwilkie||30||Borough Market is not your standard town market and mainly caters for the London tourists. This is reflected in the prices you will encounter. If you are after a bargain then this is not quite the place for you. However if you are after a sensual experience then this will satisfy your needs. The market is awash with colours and smells that tantalise the taste buds and get the mouth watering. There are so many food stalls catering for any dietary type you can think of. The prices are high but think of where it is located. You are yards from "The Shard" and London Bridge. The market is covered and kept very clean, considering the hustle and bustle of the many visitors. There are toilets situated at various locations around the market and a map is available online. There is also a central location where you can sit and enjoy eating your purchases or simply people watching.||October 24, 2017
HilaireH116||40||Since we were visiting the Globe and Southwark Cathedral, we decided to stop by London's oldest outdoor market and grab a snack. The market has a great variety of foods, ranging from traditional English to Spanish to Thai to Turkish. There are fresh fruits and veggies, cheeses, olives, seafood, sandwiches, pad thai and other noodle dishes, and baklava. It's a good place to grab something quick, and the sandwich prices are quite reasonable, especially for London.One warning, however - if you are sensitive to cigarette smoke (I'm very allergic to it), you may want to skip the market as there are many open air smokers in London, and the Southwark district is no exception. Although there was no smoking in the individual food stalls, just walking down the sidewalks in this area meant going through veils of blue-gray smoke that hung in clouds here and there. Even my husband was bothered by it, although he's not allergic. So bear in mind the risk of exposure to second hand smoke if you visit.||October 24, 2017
Emily S||50||Whenever I am in London I try and make sure to visit Borough Market. A real selection of foods and flavours available. We chose fresh (and still warm) cheese and olive bread sticks (huge, gorgeous tasting and £2.50 each... bargain) and baklava, then sat outside by the globe theatre watching the world go buy!A must visit for foodies!!||October 23, 2017
AlexisGreen||50||One of my favourite places in London - check out Brindisa for Spanish goodies and chorizo sandwiches, Oliveology for great oils, vinegars, Greek cheeses and more, Bread Ahead for doughnuts and bakery courses, Konditor and Cook for cakes, Kappacasein for cheese - the list is endless. Go for a snack, for lunch or for shopping, but please go!||October 23, 2017
zuv||40||A picturesque street market,consisting in a lot of little stalls that sell food from different part of the world,sweets,fruits,vegetables,kitchen accessories,drinks,homemade or crafted food and so on.No seats,no reservations,but tasty and appetizing.||October 23, 2017
Treats999||40||Borough Market is as buzzing as ever. Such a variety of stalls and food choices. Would be fab if there were a few more places to sit to eat the Street Food! The prices are high but worth the spend. Very few queues which is great in a market. We tried the Vegan Burger stall and were not disappointed. The cake stand which sells cheesecake, brownies, cookies and large slabs of apple-cake is a fave!||October 23, 2017
Katherine B||50||There is so many food choices in Borough Market. Flavours from near and far.In previous visits it’s been pretty easy to explore the various food outlets however on this visit (21 October) it was particularly busy. So if you are planning a visit to this food cultural haven (which I highly recommend) I would suggest avoiding the rush which would be lunchtime. ||October 22, 2017
Jaynie1410||50||We came here as it was recommended to us and we were not disappointed! Food was great, it was bustling and busy with all kinds of people. We bought cider, gin, chutney, cakes, all sorts! Make sure you are hungry whgdn you go!||October 22, 2017

Jim T||50||In a recovered historic warehouse area, partially under a bridge, Borough Market offers a cornucopia of choices for food & drink. From fish & chips, to burgers, to whatever one can desire (almost), you'll find it here. Fun to wander and discover new treats, with plenty of free samples here & there. Lots of pubs nearby as well.||October 22, 2017
brymcd||40||Chose to go here over Camden and were not disappointed - loads to see and loads of free tasters.We even got a couple of cheep Proseccos and wondered around tasting cheese.Loads of different types of food stalls and a cheese lovers dream.

whatsoph||50||If you love good food, eat your way through the market. My favorite was Roast’s pork belly sandwich. It had dry, crispy skin to contrast with the moist, tender pork meat and it tasted intensely porky. ||October 20, 2017

Tigeriffic69||30||I came across this near where I was staying. Nice place to have a walk around a bustling market. I had a Kappasein cheese toasted sandwich. It was quite pricey, and for me not worth the money. I threw half of it away.||October 20, 2017
Jan P||50||This a wonderful, and large food market. The selections eclectic & all attractive. We found much to choose from even though we are vegetarians. I would go out of my way to spend time here (especially when hungry).||October 19, 2017

No_mad_haven||50||I love the food from Ethiopian Flavours. It's cooked with African soul and bursting with mouth watering flavours and spicy fragrances...a pleasure, always. I can only suggest that they introduce a fish option for seafood lovers.||October 19, 2017
NelsonV211||40||It was my first time at the Borough market and I was positively surprise about it.The place is really cool with several places to take a quick meal or taste different products.It looks a little touristic not a real genuine market.||October 19, 2017
mrauffs||50||We're there witch my girlfriend and we had a oyster at one of the many shops it is a very nice place. And very coin if you want to spend some time seeing/tasting various food. ||October 17, 2017
RaeCX||50||Loved our visit here but just wish we'd had time and stomach space to eat lots more than we did as the range of food is divine! The smells emanating from virtually every stall just draws you in and everything looks so delicious. We bought vegan cereals, Russian bread, goats' cheese, Mexican salad, Greek salad and fresh fruit smoothies. Oh and then there was Whiskey and beer to end our visit. ||October 17, 2017
007pallavim||50||This was my third time to borough market, and this place always has something better to show.. fresh oysters, pie, cheese, pad thai - yumm!!||October 17, 2017
Andrew H||50||A little too busy (Saturday lunch time) but still a very enjoyable morning out. Just make sure you're hungry. Can't remember the stall, but it was a permanent one near one of the exits which serves fresh pasta (near a juice bar juicing grass), that was exceptionally good, and felt a bit healthier than the other things we ate.||October 17, 2017
234NeilM||40||I wouldn't make a trek across town to see it, but it is a good market. I did think that it had lost some of its charm since I last visited, as it is now quite fancy - lots of organic, international , etc, options. Nothing wrong with that - indeed, that might make it more attractive to most people - but I liked it when it was a bit more home-spun. Gotta move with the times, I guess. ||October 16, 2017
KellySJ07||50||I love how they have everything from Thai food to oyster shot. The diversity is amazing! If you visit London, Borough Market is a must. Don't forget to try the goat ice cream, creamy and very icy...||October 16, 2017
Steven-and-Soph||40||We both visited on Saturday and had a nice time. There's tons of different food stalls, offering all sorts of cuisine from German to Asian to Indian to traditional burgers and hot dogs etc, and tons more. There's lots of bakery stalls with fresh bread or cakes, cheese stalls, Jams and chutneys and fresh smoothie juices too. The prices vary from stall to stall, but 90% of the portions were incredibly generous, and all cooked fresh in front of you. The only problem that makes it a lite unenjoyable was how busy it is. We'd recommend getting there fairly early in the morning, as the later you leave it, the more people pile on in. Saying that, it's definitely worth going, and is worth putting on your to do list if in the area ||October 16, 2017
kevmal||50||Just back from a trip to London and while there was taken to Borough market by our hosts, There is something for everyone here and a must if your in the area, the range of foods is unbelievable. My friend is a chef and bought lots of foods that were alien to me.Fresh wild rabbit, hare, deer you name it its readily available.Fantastic day out and lots of brilliant restaurants. loved every minute.||October 15, 2017
ishusangh||50||Borough Market is one of the best-known and the oldest food and drink markets in Britain, which offers British and International produce. It is located next to London Bridge, in Southwark, and was defined by the bridge. Historically the area was called a Market Town, now the Market is also a wholesale area. It was first mentioned in 1276, there was no official opening, no ribbon-cutting ceremony, not even a brief mention in a chronicle. The present buildings were designed in 1851, with additions in the 1860s. The present-day market mainly sells speciality foods to the general public. However, in the 20th century, it was essentially a wholesale market, selling produce in quantity to greengrocers. It was the main supplier, along with Covent Garden, of fruits and vegetables to retail greengrocers' shops. Borough Market and the surrounding streets have been used as a film location for such features as Bridget Jones's Diary, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.||October 15, 2017
DarthPiccolo||30||This is a large market that has many things. Organic, free form, fruits, vegetables, oils and baked goods. Meat, fish, dairy, hot served foods. A number of stalls are not run by the actual people who own the stall. This is common in other markets. I'm not sure whether they are paid or voluntary workers. After noon, this place gets packed, where you have to walk like a tortoise. Many people have bad habits of standing around in the middle of the walkway or at stalls without any intention of buying things and so blocking other people from trying to purchase. Stall staff are not from London of course and most have no personality. I think many are Eastern European but selling on behalf of busy business owners. Therefore the knowledge is limited in terms of question about what is being sold. The fruit and veg stalls, the staff will watch certain people. I'm always watched. Possibly looking out for thieves. However I only go there now when the pale faced Romanian looking other half wants to purchase something. In contrast to my dark complexion she is not watched. Get here as early as possible and leave by 11:30am to avoid the rush on Saturdays.If you are Jewish or Muslim then your severely limited on what you can buy. There are actually stalls that serve vegans so that's quite a slap in the face for those who have dietary needs based upon their religion beliefs. Think the organisers of the market should show more equality and diversity when selecting and allowing stalls here. Best stalls are the raw milk. I literally only attend for those, but end up buying other things. Ellies goats milk and hook and sons milk are where you should buy raw milk from . Good staff at those stalls. Also one large stall selling flaxseeds and oils. Brilliant staff and brilliant knowledge. Hot food wise, I've been given undercooked food before so always check your meat. Ethiopian flavors have halal chicken on the menu although it's horrendously drenched in grease which you can see when a fresh batch is put on the wok. There is one selling noodles opposite it. However I don't know if they use msg as when I asked they did not know what that was, but the king prawns were undercooked so I've had stomach problems from both places due to eating once where chicken and prawns were undercooked. It's not a place to go solo. You will be dammed bored and alone. It is not a place for those that are physically disabled also, since it gets so busy I don't see how somebody say in a wheelchair can get by. I give this place 3 stars. It would get more if it had security to move people along and stop smoking in the vicinity, kosher and halal meat stalls and only allow businesses owners and not temporarily or seasonal workers to sell their foods and products. ||October 14, 2017
732vikasg||50||You can't miss this place if you are in London....The market is so lively..and there is much to eat..The two things that we loved the most were grilled cheese sandwich at "Kappacasein dairy" and donuts at "The Bread Ahead"....must visit!!||October 14, 2017
31stevenl||50||I love going here. First discovered it last year and always go anytime I’m in London. Love it! So much food to choose from. I’ve had some amazing meals here. It’s one of the biggest markets I’ve ever been to. Really well worth going to. Recently I tried the exotic meat stall. Had a fantastic ostrich burger. Also tried a salted caramel milkshake which was so delicious. Made with real ice cream. Wee bit overpriced but really enjoyed it. Heard a lot of mixed reviews about borough market. Yes it is very crowded, it’s a popular market. Yes it is expensive but a lot of markets are. It’s a great atmosphere. Best to avoid it between 12-2. Lunch rush is the busiest time. Still well worth going to ||October 13, 2017

HaljoHal||40||I wanted to wait and be the 10,000th reviewer to write about this amazing area to wander around and get seduced by the diversity of ethnic cooking smells. The food options & ambience of this London Market is most unique and every visitor should make it a stop for a wandering lunch. I suggest weekdays or earlier or later when they open or before they clos.. On weekends this market is literally wall-to-wall.||October 13, 2017
DalalRiyadh||50||You must come with an empty stomach in order to try and eat as much as you can..The people are friendly and nice.. You will see many choices of pastries and cakes as well as salads.

AndreK933||50||For my birthday we did a foodie daytrip into London and Borough Market was one of our stops. Our main focus was on streetfood stalls, which were in a little grouping in one area of the market. The main covered part houses all sorts of cheese, cured meat and other charcuterie vendors. You can also find a few restaurants dotted throughout and even ice cream, alligator burgers, alcohol, Turkish delight, the list is endless. The street food vendors offer many types of cuisine from Mexican, English, American, Asian, etc. If you're a human who eats then this would be a great place to visit for minutes to hours depending on how hungry you are. Just beware on weekends especially, it is standing room only and gets quite squashed with people.||October 12, 2017

We left with several takeaways and they were awesome as well. Check their website for schedule for the full market & stalls that are closed on certain days.||October 12, 2017
Hobo56||40||Great food and coffee here! The aromas of all the different foods is amazing. Not a lot of waiting, so you can enjoy straight away. We had great Colombian coffee and wonderful croissants from the bakery! Not to be missed!||October 12, 2017
kelseyc3695||50||I've been here twice now and it seems you discover something new every time. There are tons of options for snacks, meals and drinks. It's close to London Bridge just off the river so the location is perfect if you're out sightseeing. It can get busy on the weekends, but is definitely worth a wander. Some stands even give free samples!||October 12, 2017
342SteveO||40||An amazing paradise for foodies, with a real sense of history.There is a great selection of street food traders at the back of the market and some within the main area alongside countless artisan food producers selling everything from coffee, through breads, cheeses, spices, deli, beers, wines, ciders, cakes, pastries etc.Very busy on a Saturday though. If you want a bit of piece and quiet, head for the wall at the back, behind the main run of street food traders.Favourite stalls are Horn OK Please (South Indian Vegan Street Food), the Ethiopian Curries and the trader who sells very tasty Middle Eastern Spiced minced lamb||October 12, 2017
CheeKianWing||50||Borough Market is accessible via the London Bridge Underground station. Do note that it is closed on Sundays though, and some stalls may be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays as well.This was our first visit to Borough Market and we didn't know what to expect, having visited other markets in Scandinavia and the like. This, however, was an entirely different experience! First of all, almost all stalls were selling food that was ready for consumption straightaway. For example, a stall selling chicken might sell chicken sandwiches while a stall selling fruit might be peddling fruit juice. There was a great variety of food and drink on sale that will undoubtedly appeal no matter what your food preference is.Apart from the market itself, there was also an open area with more stalls selling only food items. Lots of food there as well, even Ethiopian cuisine!All in all, great stop for both your eyes and your tummies! Highly recommended.||October 11, 2017
Cz09090||50||Having never been to borough market before, I now wish I lived closer.It's a great place offering everything you can imagine.We tried some fresh deserts (brownies) and bought some fresh sausage rolls. The atmosphere is great, stool owners friendly, though I wouldn't advise going at around 17:00 as it becomes very busy. ||October 11, 2017
ZFCA||40||Went to the Borough Market for the first time, good fun. The food stalls are really good. Had the Singaporean Laksa it was excellent, great taste and good value for money. Also, tried the roast beef sandwich which is a must have, one of the best I have had. The fudge stand had some very different varieties.||October 11, 2017
DeathsDragon95||40||We have been here quite a few times. This place is very busy. There are a lot of stalls selling different foods such as bread, cheese, meats, cooked food etc. There are different types of stalls and shops selling a variety of foods from different countries, some offer tasters. There are interesting things to see and it is relatively big. I would recommend visiting this place.||October 11, 2017
ncooper130||50||Great selection of food from cheese to fresh seafood, cider & wines and basically anything you can think of then over to the Green market for fresh fresh food from all over the world.||October 11, 2017
joaomalha||50||I was there at lunch, on a Tuesday, but it was very crowded, full of life, with a girl playing and singing. It is, without a doubt, a place one should visit when in London. And as lots of places to eat, with different offers, and you can taste completely different flavours for a good price.||October 11, 2017
MerriF_11||50||Epicurean delight for hungry travellers - something for every palate & beautiful fresh food & drink options.||October 10, 2017

Greenrosseta||50||I went three times durning my last visit to London and I tried a lot food variety. Had the best cheese and fresh homemade bread. It was fantastic. Great place for food lovers.||October 9, 2017
YorkiesEngland||50||Had our first visit to borough market this weekend. This is a great place for lunch if you are in the shard area. Great atmosphere. Lots of different food stalls with cuisine from all over the world. Lots of lovely foods to try and to buy. Well worth spending an hour or two here. ||October 8, 2017
Daisiesmum||50||Visited the market on a Saturday. The first stall seen was Ted's Veg and I giggled at people taking pics of the veg - have they not seen veg before I asked, but you just feel drawn too take pictures to try and absorb the atmosphere. Absolutely fantastic market, little samples offered to try before you buy, traders friendly, knowledgeable and happy to give advice. Even the teenagers in the group weren't bored. It was amazing.Would love to go back and spend more time - perhaps on a less busy day. ||October 7, 2017
maggie1966||50||Something for everyone here. Food and drink from all cultures.Great place to meander and try new things.Stall holders friendly and helpful.A must if in vicinity.||October 7, 2017
ramidao||50||Borough Market on the weekend it was fun. Crowded of people. You will be full before buying food . There is many good testing. Don’t miss it. ||October 7, 2017
MsNinaG||50||We spent an afternoon/lunch here and ate our way through this market. So many great unique things to try and eat. I'd say a do not miss if you are in town for some time. More than just cheese and mustards - we spent time at a whiskey bar with unique stock.||October 6, 2017
Dafman72||50||I was incredibly pleased to find out that a work conference - at Glaziers Hall - meant that I could walk two minutes up the lane to Borough Market.I hadn't been in years (used to live in London, so was a fairly regular visitor) so was very pleased to see it was just as good as I'd remembered, though I didn't have enough time to walk round all the stalls. I only had the chance to do the mainly uncovered section (closest to Southwark Cathedral) but I liked what I saw (and eat, obviously).So... my lunch was a delicious pulled lamb from Airey's Farm (I think) who were Herdwick sheep specialists - they had a big pan of glorious-smelling shredded lamb, which they served with rice and salad leaves in a wrap or in a box. I went for the box as I was fairly confident that the wrap would guarantee that I'd get food on my suit or tie. My only gripe with that dish was that as it cooled it got pretty greasy.One of the many cake/bakery/patisserie stalls nearby does a lovely white chocolate & peanut blondie - unfortunately I don't remember its name. Sadly I can't remember the names of he nearby chocalatier or macaroon stalls in the same section but they also had very lovely produce.In brief, make sure you visit if you ever get a chance. It's just a few minutes walk from London Bridge station, barely 15 minutes walk from Tower Bridge and even less from HMS Belfast.||October 6, 2017
mgill2005||50||Borough Market is on the South Bank of the Thames near London Bridge. Very easy to get to by all transit systems. We visited in Aug 2017 and met a friend to eat in Fish!, an upscale fish and chips place, also highly recommended.||October 6, 2017
devonlad101||50||All we can say is wow,superb busy market with lots of amazing food to eat and and stalls to buy almost any food or drink u can imagine Well worth a visit when in London ||October 5, 2017
wick1979||50||Make this your first stop in London. It is one of the only places in the city where you can eat and enjoy good food with actual spices. Lines can be long at some of the stalls but great finds to be had. We loved the Italian pork roast sandwich. ||October 5, 2017
Andrew S||50||Lots of stalls selling delicious food and most importantly delicious coffee. It's not that big so you won't need to spend a great deal of time here.||October 5, 2017
LittleLondonWhispers||50||Personally, I love market shopping and lunchtimes are the best time to visit as the hustle and bustle creates a great atmosphere. Wandering through the stalls I’ve never found as many coloured carrot choices anywhere else, that’s for sure. The spicy Calabrian sun dried tomatoes that the Italian stall sells are so good, no description will do them justice, but they are a must have! Truffle shaved cheese from Jumi Cheese, fresh fruit pots always draw me over, and I cannot leave without a serious veg shop.||October 4, 2017
Yukari K||50||It's one of the places which have to go in your London trip !It open 10AM-17PMThey have several kinds of food shops as fruit,meets,cheese,bread,spices,cake...many food carts. It's like a festival !Even weekdays many people are enjoying.I want to back again there :-)||October 3, 2017
3larkg||50||This is an incredible place to go. If I lived in London I would go every week.The food is amazing, fresh fruit, cheese, meats, wine, beautiful fruit drinks.Cooked foods. Would go again and again. The fruit and vegetables are soCheap compared to Australia. ||October 3, 2017
dbtanky||40||a delight if you love food , so much choice it's difficult to decide what to eat and what to drool over. If you are like me you end up trying as much as you can manage and don't eat your tea. some really interesting foods from all over the world and freshly cooked. Cheap too , but there are also speciality food stalls with preserves and other stock items , biscuits, cheese , porridges , muesli etc , I think I even saw soaps on offer. Don't eat those.||October 3, 2017
Coconutcrush||40||Excellent place to spend time with friends - family just drinking good wine and enjoying tasty cheeses and olives and watching the world go by. Great vibe , friendly staff , perfect location - somewhere youShould spend Saturday afternoons !! ||October 3, 2017
Sanbeco61||50||If you want just about every cuisine in the World I’m just one location then head to Borough Market.Colour sensory overload!Smells overload of some the best cooking on offer Visually every bit attractive and vibrant.Great fun to try so many different types of cuisine and drinks.||October 2, 2017
RobClarey||50||I love this place. We go with family, friends, business and even on my own. Food drink or just too have a nosey. Cider bar greatFish monger with cooking greatWine bar goodAll pubs around are greatWhat a place for tapas. Give it a go. I love the tapas bars on the side of the cathedral. You walk down the steps before the bridge or go all the way through the market. ||October 2, 2017
callmemochelle||50||Fantastic place for food, but some places can be a bit pricey. Borough Market is one of London's oldest market. There's various dates on when it was first built, but per the web site it is listed as 1756. It is open Monday to Saturday, but not all the vendors are available Monday and Tuesday. Find the London Bridge, find the Market. Or, it's near the Shard. We took the Tube and got off London Bridge.There's 2 parts of the Market, and we went to the one that looked like a glass atrium. One of the information workers said that most of the hot food stands were located in the glass part of the market, while the adjacent building had mostly produce, food items like oils and meats, and takeaway items. Since we were there early, we took advantage of the no lines and picked up an early lunch. I chose the Roast Hog, while Stephen chose the Meat Pie. There are no tables and chairs in the Market, but in the atrium there were benches. We awkwardly ate our meal and then went across the walkway to the other part of the Market.Just right outside the Market was a coffee house called Monmouth. That place had a long line, so we decided to check it out to see what the fuss was about. Stephen had a flat white, at a pricey 3,10 for a tiny cup. IMHO it was a bit pretentious of a coffee place. We walked around a bit more, before making our way to the Tower Bridge and then the Sky Garden, by way of the Queen's Walk along the River Thames.||October 2, 2017
Mark R||50||Borough market reflects the diversity of London in food. Items from around the world both raw and cooked give a real feel of international cuisine and the wide ranging tastes of Londoners||October 2, 2017
rachaels25||40||Even after recent events Borough Market hasn't let that dampen it's atmosphere and USP. It's was bustling and there was so much food to choose from! Ranging from sweet to vegan, it was hard to choose. There were also specialist stalls that were 'free-from' too. Highly recommend if you fancy the street food style and also trying something new.||October 2, 2017
Global-Villagerr||50||We've been visiting Borough for many years, and always enjoy it. It has gone upscale in recent years, with posh (and now pricey) shops. But the choices of cooked food and stalls for bald goods, veggies, dairy and on and on are great. Don't miss Southwark Cathedral nearby. It used to be open only on three days of the week. But since the renovation, there are some food stalls there every day. We prefer to go very early and eat bubble and squeak at the venerable Maria's stall in the middle of the market. She's the best!||October 2, 2017
Pam T||50||Amazing place very trendy pubs food in the market is just brilliant. Wish we had something like it where we live. I can't wait to go back again. ||October 2, 2017
558brucer||50||We took the family to Borough Market to get a real feel for London and to try something a bit different for lunch. The kids absolutely loved it and thought the market was brilliant. We also thought all the stall members were super friendly and really helpful.Borough Market is now one of out top things to do in London!||October 1, 2017
TereseRC||50||Wow, this is a fantastic market. There are many food stations where you are able to purchase fresh veggies, meat, seafood to bring home and cook; or if visiting purchase the many prepared foods to eat there. Our daughter visited here while studying abroad and gave us recommendations. We purchased the coconut pancakes from a Thai vendor. They were sweet and delectable. You get 8 per order. If you want just the pancakes and not other Thai food, let the pancake chef know so you don’t have to wait in the long line! We also went to Pieminister (not sure of exact spelling) and purchased a meat pie! You can get them hot or cold. Whoa, they are scrumptious! There are several types and are full of meat, gravy and the outer pastry shell is buttery and lush! There are innumerable food stations for every pallet. A must go to if you are in London ||October 1, 2017
Zoe0805||40||Worth visiting if you’re in the area, personally I wouldn’t bother going again as stupid prices, way too expensive to actually do a shop here so more of a tourist location but worth a look around||October 1, 2017
joanne b||50||Looved the Borough market...so much fun! Lots of food of every kind to be seen, all under one roof. If I lived in London, I'd probably go once a week. Delicious Bread A Head donuts, Spanish tapas, cheese so much cheese, Turnips yummy watermelon smoothies, German bratwurst and a great vegan burger for my friend were all enjoyed. The tea and spice shops were great too. Great place to pick up a couple of unique gifts. Could of spent the day there...so much to see and eat. Had a great vibe too.||October 1, 2017
normanj187||50||All the years I have lived in the south of England and this is my first visit to the market. What a lot of wasted years. The selection of vegetables and specialty food is absolutely out of this world||September 30, 2017
hottoddy0||50||This was our first trip to the market and we were blown away with the size of the market and range of food stalls. There are also a good number of stalls providing hot food of all kinds.We sampled the hot salted beef and it was mouthwatering. We only had a small sandwich but two was enough for 4! Glad we didn't have the large size as that must be ginormous! All the stall holders were very friendly and a good number will gladly provide samples of their wares with a view for you to buy. You can get very full doing this so beware.The fresh veg stalls had so much produce much of which we hadn't experienced before.One of our party is a chef and even he hadn't seen some items. All was in great condition.The market is so big we didn't do it justice - it just whet the appetite to go again.||September 30, 2017
MSK888||50||This place is so busy every day and especially on the weekends. Always high quality, good food on offer. A must visit place.||September 30, 2017
Tuffino||40||Good shopping experience. Lovely food at every turn with some really good restaurants, street food and pubs. Highly recommend.||September 30, 2017
JonWilsonAdventure||50||There are different types of food shop to suit your needs. I like the most is you can taste different foods in the same time. From Asian to African to European to seafoods.||September 30, 2017
jenleZ||50||The best market we visited in London. Great variety of foods - Breads, Ice cream, Cheeses , Herbs, Vegetables, Fruits, Meats, Tea, Coffee and all you can think about.||September 30, 2017
DeanMcc007||50||Have been to London many times but this was the first time to Borough Market and I must say this place was fantastic !Not really a market person we were drawn into the various smells and soon got drawn into it full time.Before we knew it we had bought cakes, pastries, fresh pesto and olives !!This place is a must see if in London !!!||September 29, 2017
Dit_fromage||50||Bustling, buzzing and eccentricity English by way of the offerings. Artisan foods created and presented with love. Give it a visit and you won't be disappointed - a treat for photographers too.||September 29, 2017
Voyageur4457||30||I have been crossing-over it twice a day this week, on my way to a Conférence. It is a very charming place, the restaurants around are lovely. ||September 28, 2017
LindsayVerv||50||Check this place out for sure! Some amazing vendors and quite the collection of food! Huge oysters in the half shell prepared fresh, fresh scallops with bacon, pasta dishes, meats & cheeses... incredible selection of so many things!||September 28, 2017
Leoba32||30||Lots of food choices, a German deli and a short walk to Southwark Cathedral, a peaceful place with a nice post lunch cup of tea. If you have children in pushchair this is a very crowded market. The toilets are being refurbished so there are temporary ones with a long queue for the ladies||September 28, 2017
Lawrence2300||50||This is what a market should be. Places to shop. Places to eat. Spectacular items to try. All local. No silly gift shops selling cheap imports! Illogical layout makes it even mor fun. Highly recommended. ||September 27, 2017
JamesM304||50||You can seriously loose your day at the Borough! AND your waist!Lots of varieties of great food and drink that is extremely tasty and most stall holders will let you try samples.My tip would be to order a portion of something and share and then try something else and share again. This way you’ll end up trying more of the wonderful food and drinks.The choice really is astounding and you will return time and time again.It’s had some difficulties after the recent attacks in London but that is very unusual and it really won’t deter me||September 27, 2017
fPisces101||50||This is a wonderful place near tower bridge in London. There is a huge selection, from bangers (sausages) to shellfish, large assortment of artisan breads, delightful pastries and cakes. Vegan assortment of foods, wines, a wonderful spice shop with the worlds hottest chilli, and powdered fruits for making smoothies or uses in baking. A must visit, and once is not enough.||September 27, 2017
louloulancaster||50||We visited here recently and loved it. There are loads of take away food stalls which smell gorgeous. We had a scotch egg and and huge sausage bap they were delicious. We also bought oils and balsamic vinegar from a lovely shop the olive oil company. Great Italian people who really knew about the products. Well worth a purchase. My husband got his haircut at the barber's great guy and a cool shop. I loved the place also its a five minute walk to the golden hind. .||September 27, 2017
Max P||40||Borough Market is a fantastic place to visit.If you're thinking about visiting Borough Market when in London, go for it, you'll enjoy it.Although very traditional in some ways, this is very sophisticated street market, very clean and well kept.The stalls offer a wide variety of products, most of which are of a premium quality. You can purchase ready to eat food if you'rehungry, or packaged food to take home.Fresh bread, doughnuts, cakes, cheese, meat, pasta, is all available. You can purchase your ingredients for home cooking, or you can eat while you're there. Burgers, cheese toasties, chorizo rolls, there really is a great variety of food available.If you're not hungry, you'll probably still find something to tempt you while you're wondering around the market stalls. It all looks and smells so good.Add this place to your list of places to see on you're next day outin London. It's a fun and interesting place to visit.||September 27, 2017
John67-7||40||It's almost a hawker centre. The food is pretty good, there are few benches to sit and eat and it's bustling. Not many produce stalls but mostly full of restaurants, cafes and food carts. I tried four places and the food was a bit mixed but worth it overall. It's right outside London Bridge tube and next to the shard.||September 26, 2017
814charlieh||50||Borough Market - a superb, eclectic mix of cultures, street cuisines, artistry, restautrants, pubs, and barrows you must not miss! It is one of the largest and oldest food markets in London, dating back to earlier than 1014!This one is a no-brainer, just do it.||September 26, 2017
Isa-Francis||50||This is not only a "traditional" market in which you can buy your daily produce... it is also a cool place in which you can grab a bite made out of the freshest food possible, and enjoy a drink.If you plan to eat out for diner, this might spoil your experience as you'll have to contain yourself from buying very appetizing stuff. This could be a good lunch option.||September 26, 2017
RichardT652||50||A wonderful collection of shops and stalls selling first class produce and goods. This market is not the largest in London, but is a must for foodies. It is conveniently located near London Bridge Station. If eating here, and there are many hot food stalls, be prepared to stand. There's not many seats available. Prices are not cheap, but this is not a bargain basement market, and does not pretend to be.Highly recommended.||September 25, 2017
10sChick||40||The Borough Market is an old "under the bridge" feel of a market with the main emphasis being the variety of food. It's not much of a craft market, mainly food vendors and then followed up with places were you can buy spices, cheeses and such. There's really no point in going if you're not hungry and planning to eat there. Everything we tried there including the desserts were all great. There's a sign leading down to it as soon as you cross the London bridge heading south. Worth a trip if you're in that area. Doing a nice South Bank river walk afterwards is easy from that location and a really pleasant stroll along a lively boardwalk all the way to the London Eye.||September 25, 2017
Colt S||40||We went to this place which is really well located near the tube station, so not to far to walk. This market had lots of selection and so much is crammed into this market. Very impressed with the selection of produce on offer from tea, cheese,french duck,bakery,vegetables,seafood etc the list goes on.Some stalls accept card payments and some just cash, so it depends on the stall that you buy from.Recommended !!!||September 25, 2017
GOMS2013||50||If you are even remotely interested in food then this is a place for you. Take the tube to London Bridge and it is an easy 3-4 min walk from there. The quality of food available is excellent with about 50-60% from all parts of the UK and the rest from around the world. Allow 3-4 hours plus to go around including the 'green market' (small stalls with mainly international street food). Too many fab stalls to mention by name but the universal common thread is the quality. Weekends are the most busy but try Wednesday, Thursday or Friday mornings. Be there for opening at around 10am. Check out also the demo kitchen around lunchtime with different guest chefs/presenters.||September 24, 2017
keeleymitch||50||Love this place so much. One dude you can buy all locally produced fresh produce from veggies to cheese, cakes, bread, fish, pate and spices. The other side is full of stalls selling every food imaginable from burgers, cheese toasters, sausages, fish and chips, the list is endless. Great place to wander and stuff your face ||September 24, 2017
Globalgalxxx||50||This place really has a beating heart It's pure and true to everything that Britain has to offer It's full of kindness. Happiness. Innovation. Care. Consideration. Warmth. It's truly a mixture of everything us as humans value.To lean against a post in the midst of everything and just "watch, feel, listen" is truly rewarding as is the amazing food served. One of the few beating hearts our city has ❤️||September 24, 2017
109sandyw||30||If you like food then you must go. Easy tube ride with its own stop. Or you can come on another line which includes walking over London Bridge. Range is fantastic. But it is not cheap. ||September 23, 2017
Rachel B||50||Fantastic range of producers and vendors. Its almostbimpossible to pick what to have because it all looks and smells amazing. Very busy but well worth a visit!||September 22, 2017
LadySunshine2241||50||Attended here yesterday morning and going back today. Wonderful architecture over stalls where they pull you in with the smells of amazing different cuisines.

157DavidM||50||The bar is high for food stalls here. You name it, you can get it. Fabulous craft breads, olive oils, unusual fruit and quality veg, meat, fish and cheese and and and. Lots of burgers and other really tasty "fast" food here but ultra tasty and high quality ||September 21, 2017
pitufo00||50||We came here primarily to walk about, find some food and have a good time. Mission accomplished! Teeming with people, keep your elbows tucked in and be patient. So much that you can get there if you are in a mind to shop! Most of it is covered, so a good place to go if it rains (it was the day we went).Harry Potter fans - this is a site in the Prisoner of Azkaban - on our list of seeing HP movie sites while in London.||September 21, 2017
Syme0n||50||With all the varieties offered here, you are free to decide an assortment of food you so desire. There are so many delectables ranging from pastry to genuine British fish and chips and fresh oysters that you can literally lose yourself here. The Monmouth outlet has a branch here and their coffee is indeed one of a kind. This place is a must visit whenever you're in London if you are into packing a punch when it comes to delicious food.||September 21, 2017
Bill S||50||We spent a great time in borough market, with all the delights of outside cooking.the smells bring you in and the noise of people busy cooking food from around the world,the tastes play music on your tongue,the different textures are wonderful.its one visit that’s quickly followed by another||September 20, 2017
Julie M||50||We came on a Saturday morning to wander through the food stalls - I was super impressed with the quality and affordability of the produce ||September 20, 2017
Jane K||50||Not as big as we thought it would be but still a great place. All you need to do is stroll about, look , listen, stop here and there for bits to eat or drink . A good place to come if its raining (as under cover) . I had a glass of fizz and oysters then Argentinian street food (simply gorgeous empanadas) and a refreshing Argentinian beer from the stall next door. Loved the mustard stall and (expensive) kitchen shop. Lots around to see as well such as Southwark Cathedral , the Shard the Golden Hind .||September 20, 2017
Warby P||50||Great area with fantastic atmosphere. The centre piece is the famous old market selling mainly food with lots of character. Surrounded by a decent selection of bars and restaurants ||September 20, 2017
JiffChan||40||Best to have your lunch in this historical market as there are many foods from different country to choose. Oyster, fried rice, cheese, roasted chicken, beer …….Besides, there are many local products like honey, vegetable, seafood, fruits with reasonable prices in London.If you love to eat, you must go go go and enjoy! Sunday is rest day for this market.||September 20, 2017
alinasw22||50||Open are and covered market with lots of stalls selling oil , cheese and meats etc. We went for lunch and got a pulled pork sandwich which was £6. Lots of stuff to sample and great foods and other things to buy. Definitely recommend going for an hour or so. ||September 19, 2017
Joanna381||40||Been coming here for yeara. It's great, definitely worth visiting, especially for lunch. But it's too busy amd too many people come for the space. So go, enjoy, but expect it to be rammed||September 19, 2017
saunderslizzie||30||Foolish person that I am. Note that the market's big day is Saturday when all sorts of foods from around the world are cooked and served by people who care about food BUT NOT ON Sunday ||September 19, 2017
bluewings7_11||50||Fantastic place for food lovers. You shouldn't be in a rush to enjoy to the fullest as there are many stalls with sampling. The boar pies are to die for!||September 18, 2017
47jazminp||40||It's a great place to grab a quick lunch. There are many options, and many specialty food items for sale, it's definitely worth the visit. The paella was very very good. The only down side was no restrooms on site.||September 18, 2017
billybob101||50||Unfortunately for us, when we strolled around the market we had already had lunch (at Union Street Café) so we were all full (well... maybe we had enough room for some ice cream that was excellent!!) My regret.. not finding a Cornish pastie!!||September 18, 2017
bigredk9||50||This is a must see stop for a drink and some fantastic food from all over the world. There are also a whole lot of vendors selling all sorts of items. ||September 18, 2017
SeattleCyclingMom||50||I absolutely LOVED every minute spent in this market. The energy, the smells, the colors, and most importantly the food. We had delicious fish and chips, a Salt Beef sandwich that was to die for, delicious cheese and ice cream, and much more. Highly recommend.||September 17, 2017
ProdiptoB2||40||Saturday at the Borough Market is great. There are a large number of food and drink options all of which are excellent.||September 17, 2017
E8526JMmichaels||50||Visited on a bustling saturday afternoon and the place was very busy, had a lovely strawberry cheesecake from one stall. Left the market to do some more siteseeing but planned to go back for a burger later that day. We found a burger place by the side of the church, we had a londoner burger and a plain burger with onions. The burgers were absolutely gorgeous and the rustic fries were very tasty||September 17, 2017
sabatinitennis||40||I'm old enough to remember when this riverside area was derelict, run down and an eyesore. Mind you, good for photography ....especially the spooky Winchester Square. The area is now to new cafes, restaurants, a boat, the ruin if the old Winchester Palace, the new Shakespeare Theatre and the glorious riverside Anchor pub. Its worth a walk through and call in at Southwark Cathedral too in its midst. It's been transformed beyond belief in the last decade.||September 17, 2017
gricygirl||50||Came across this area when looking at the Shard and was very impressed. So many food stalls you are totally spoilt for choice! The smells are amazing and even though it was very busy it being lunchtime it was a great place to walk around taking in the sights and smells well worth a visit.||September 17, 2017
Donna E||50||Our family had a beautiful time walking through these markets. We loved how generous the stall owners were in providing taste tests of their produce. There was such a huge selection of organic home made produce as well. And i loved seeing the water initiative where your water bottles can be filled for free to eliminate the one use water bottles that everyone buys daily. And for those that forget to bring their own water bottles you can purchase one at the stall instead to use throughout your holidays. Fantastic idea!!!||September 17, 2017
Mikez888||10||This place is hugely overrated and is a platform for corporate vendors to market their mass produced fayre. There are probably only a handful of genuine market or farm vendors here, the rest are using extremely poor quality produce, dressing it up to look like a small operation and pricing it sky high. There should be an inspection for how genuine vendors are suitable to trade here and get rid of the 90% of them that are ruining this once admirable institution of London.Be wary of buying ready cooked food here, as others have mentioned below the hygiene is questionable and we tried the hog roast roll which must be avoided. The meat was tough and salty as hell plus he managed to somehow smear the apple sauce all over the OUTSIDE of the bun so you cannot even hold it. No basic common sense, no quality control and no courtesy towards serving the customer. Avoid and go to a genuine farm shop instead.||September 17, 2017
maynardc||40||An enjoyable walk and seeing lots of fresh produce and different cuisines. It's great for a nice lunch treat and to taste a variety of cheeses and meats. The architecture is well kept and the area has plenty to see, it's very vibrant. ||September 16, 2017
JoanJh||50||This is my favorite place for food in London. They have fresh produce, seafood, deli, coffee, bakeries, and even a gluten free bakery that offered a variety of treats including Battenberg cake. Everything we had was fresh or freshly made and exceptionally good.||September 15, 2017
Lynn F||40||We had a food tour through Borough Market and we also visited on our own. This place was exciting and had every kind of food you could imagine. We had oysters (probably the freshest I've ever tasted), fish & chips (of course), street pie (delicious & filling) and even tasted and bought the same flavor cheese that was served at Prince William's wedding! The market is full of food and wonderful history and legacy! The place is always hopping! Go hungry, ready to walk and spend some enjoyable time. But make sure you know that most places in the market are closed by 6pm or so.||September 15, 2017
SonyaPineo||50||While we were staying at the CitizenM in August, we would come here almost everyday for lunch! It was wonderful, with so many choices! There was a fantastic gluten free bakery too!! Yum!! We even made a rushed trip on the day we were leaving London, just to get our favourite foods one last time! Highly recommend checking out the Borough Market!||September 14, 2017
ChieK801||50||If you love food, you should visit this market. The butcher in front of Monmouth Coffee shop sells the best sausage roll...!||September 14, 2017
AdamWinnipeg||40||This is a great street market with lots of options and a fun hustle and bustle. Try some food and hang out for a bit.||September 13, 2017
easterntreker||50||We stopped here once we crossed the London Bridge . Really excellent place for a meal . Nice little restaurants scattered around and if you are looking for great cheese this is the place.||September 13, 2017
Kamander||40||We zipped through here, but from the brief time I was there I wish we would have been able to come back, at least once more and had time to stay a while. There was so many interesting shops and appealing foods to choose from, and that's not even something I normally like to do. We tasted lots of different foods, and it was all delicious, but the only thing I recall is the sausages, which were great.||September 13, 2017
Parish31||40||First I should point out that we are overdue another visit to this great market and I cannot actually remember when we last went since we moved to the east Midlands. However, it will be on our must do list next time we make it up to London. The variety of fresh produce on sale and things to eat is unsurpassed in my experience and it is so easy to get to from the southembankment.Borough was in the news for all the wrong reasons 3 months ago bit do not let that put you off going when you are in London.||September 13, 2017
113jop||50||Yes it's busy but it's worth it. Get a glass of fizz and take your time. So many amazing foods to try, the forest mushrooms are great and try the Comte and mushroom pate man!||September 13, 2017
Tim K||50||We got into London and couldn't check in for two hours so we walked over to the Borough Market. We had ourselves a field day!First, we stopped and got ourselves some fresh oysters. They were extremely fresh and sweet! After getting our fill of oysters we headed over to grab some hotdogs with traditional English Mustard and sauerkraut. As we were heading back we saw a huge line at fish! So we finished the day off with some flaky buttery fish and chips. ||September 13, 2017
mk0786||50||A brilliant market very near the shard , great experience and the variety of food and produce is amazing , the traders we lovely .A great lively market ||September 13, 2017
jewelofpc||50||We loved everything about Borough Market!! My husband had Duck Confit from Le Marche du Quartier and I had the best toasted cheese sandwich that I have ever had in all of my life!!! We will be taking about these two sandwiches until we are able to make the trip from the US back to Borough Market again in the future. Ooooooh how I wish we could call for delivery!!!! ||September 12, 2017
DANIELLA107||50||The oldest market of London.Great stalls of organic vegetables, eggs etcWonderful lunch to have in situ.Middle eastern food, South American , Greek ,wonderful cheese and breads. Many people from all over. A very cosmopolitan atmosphere to it.||September 12, 2017
evekowska||50||Great place to try and experience different kinds of food, amazing oysters at Richard Howard's oysters, lovely goat koftas at gourmet goat and many more! Good selections of tapas, breads, cheeses and different kinds of meats. If in London stop there for a longer lunch/dinner break!||September 11, 2017
Penwyllt||40||This is always worth a visit with a good spectrum of different food stalls with terrific produce especially vegetables and lots of restaurants. It was closing down about 5 pm. So we were happy to have just arrived in time. We sampled some delicious empanada's which are small pasties from the Argentina This stall called Portena's was great very friendly and they had a glass of wine and three empanada's deal. We recommend the spicy chicken and the spinach and ricotta||September 11, 2017
Jeffdee||50||This is a lovely place and it's great to see life carrying on here as if nothing had ever happened. There is a massive variety of food and drink from around the world and the most beautiful vegetables! There are many places to eat and drink, we had delicious cheesy empanadas from an Argentinean stall. It's also good to have a drink and watch the world go by.||September 10, 2017
REAL_CONTESSA||50||Best place to try amazing foods, local cheeses and frankly, if you want something specific to eat, chances are there will be a stall selling it. Look for for man who sells fudge (AMAZING) and the Indian dosa stall (made fresh while you wait).||September 9, 2017
Gumilabu||50||Easy to find, really great food selection of different countries.Pastries, fruits, coffee, meats, fish, veggie options, everyone can find something without any problem.Opens early on Saturdays from 8am and it is cool to be early before it gets crowded.The market is a must.||September 9, 2017
VicKy_6655||40||A diverse market with lots of fresh products and a wide range of dishes from all over the world. Not cheap but the selection is tremendous. Do not miss even for the trip itself.||September 9, 2017
Lance A||50||Borough Market, on London's South Bank close to the Shard and London Bridge, has existed for well over 100 years in its cavernous Victorian halls, and focusses on fresh foods - fruit and veg, seafood, artisan breads etc. Numerous restaurants also. The produce is more varied, colourful, healthy-looking and tempting than most supermarket alternatives!The Market has bounced back from the recent attack trauma and deserves our support. Well worth spending an hour or so when you are in central London.||September 8, 2017
weez911||40||Tired the brilliant haddock and chips in the market, as well as the prawn/Cajun fish wrap. Market was crowded but the buzz was nice. Recommend to go there with an empty stomach!||September 7, 2017
275kimmyd||50||I love this market it has the best food in London and a variety of selections of organic Products's to amazing foods for lunch! It's architecturally beautiful as it's in an old warm near the Thames with tons of cute Resto's! It's very near the Tate museum. Love love this place ||September 7, 2017
Mark J||20||I really, really wanted the market to be a better place to visit than it was. It's an easy tube ride from anywhere in the city, has a lot of interesting eateries, fun things to purchase, a great vibe and has plenty of pubs in the neighborhood. The ABSOLUTE downside? Astoundingly crowded. Elbow to elbow, 6 deep at virtually every stall for the entirety of our 2 1/2 hour stay. It was so bad we cancelled a return visit for the next weekend. Adding insult to injury there is virtually NOWHERE to sit once you purchase a food item. You simply stand and eat/drink until you're done. Unfortunately this applied to every corner of the market. For my family it turned what should have been a great experience into something far less satisfying. Forget it if you have young children. Hopefully during the week would be a better experience.||September 6, 2017
dcan85||50||We've made a habit of eating here at least once on every trip we've made to London because it's convenient, you can't miss it from the London Bridge underground stop, it's affordable, two people can eat for £20-25 if necessary - or you could splurge, and it has great options, whether you get the paella - and you should at least once - or the scallops, oysters, or bison burger, there's something for everyone and it's all good. Also, if you're in town during the Christmas holiday season stop in for the seasonal decorations and mulled wine. ||September 6, 2017
Kim K||50||Borough Market has everything - shopping, food, tea, restaurants - in a great location. We enjoy visiting here!||September 6, 2017
anna_c182||50||Amazing market, a must visit for all people going to London! You can get food of all different types from here, cooked fresh. The atmosphere is great and the colours are wonderful!||September 6, 2017
HannuH_12||50||Really crowded at lunchtime because of the various fast food stalls. It's great that you can actually buy wegetables, seafood and meat like in any proper market. This is a place to visit!||September 6, 2017
orlytModi_in||50||We came for lunch... great options..sea food, meat, pastas, and plenty of goodies. Beautifully set up ... great to walk through... and very tasty!!Recommended!!||September 6, 2017
dawnmY3276UT||50||In London for the bank holiday weekend and, being blessed by the weather, decided to spend Saturday night at Borough Market. What a brilliant and vibrant place. Lots of people, great bars, brilliant music and a wonderful atmosphere. We had our best night out in ages, people so friendly, wish we could go every weekend.||September 6, 2017
ZennBD||50||This was one of the best parts of the trip to London. We had planned to come back for another meal here, but did not realize it closes up by 5pm, so plan accordingly. Not very much room, lots of lines and crowds, but the food was fantastic. Be prepared to eat standing up.||September 6, 2017
milena otacilia s||50||I met the place in the winter of last year. loved it. It is a pulsating place, full of people from everywhere and with wonderful food. it is well worth the visit.||September 6, 2017
TrevorHall||50||We are mad keen on taste so it's no surprise that with so many stalls offering free samples (small, perfect for tasting and deciding) we felt we were in taste heaven. We bought spices and raclette cheeses, amongst others, products so difficult to locate near home. This will become a regular attraction for us on our London breaks.||September 6, 2017
sheilacL3125SZ||50||Can't say enough good things about this place it's interesting in every way food and offer is sexing to none for quality..... I had lunch from one of the stalls it was amazing !!! If you get a chancecwhile in London it's a must see !!!||September 6, 2017
UnicornIsland||50||All food here are international street foods. Different varieties from Asia. Honestly better than any chain restaurant. Street food suppose to be cheap like under a fiver per bowl. Nearly tener any bowl is a lots. London eats is expensive £££. Monmouth coffee here is not as good as you think. Too busy to make a decent cup. Good vibes market. ||September 6, 2017
LeFoodCritic17||50||If your ever in London and walking through borough market you have to try and find the stall selling this. The market has hundreds of great options but this one far outweighs them all or at least try this before anything else.The cheese is melted on the wheel and then scrapped onto a bed of potatoes what more can you say all that's left is to try it.||September 5, 2017
DaniOrta||50||Amazing! I had no idea about it, and I found it by chance... but I loved it! It is such a great place that you do not know well where you are. Fruits, breads, meals, pints, chocolates... amazing! Near to the Shard!||September 5, 2017
Frank D||50||This is a world-class food and drink market; probably the best I've seen in the world. The variety, quality, layout, and sheer history of this place are unmatched. My favourites include the fresh pasta stand, the oysters, the duck confit brioche and the "Pieminister" pies, but take your pick, and be impressed. Phenomenal place to wonder and graze, followed by a pint of cider overlooking the Thames at the Anchor pub nearby.||September 5, 2017
gregwilson09||50||Borough Market is located literally several paces from the London Bridge Tube Station and provides an amazing array of food from different cultures and all incredibly presented and largely handmade. As soon as you enter, a wave of terrific smells greets you. From cheeses to handcrafted burgers, oriental cuisine to fish and chips, the selection of food is endless. Everywhere is always busy and the lunchtime rush from local areas such as the Strand are typical from midday-1pm so beware if you don't wish to be tangled up in that!Highly recommend the Whiskey Ginger Londoner Burger - mouth-wateringly good and the accompanied sides of chips must be made mandatory!||September 4, 2017
chloegsr||50||Definitely worth a visit, we had a hard time deciding what to eat, bad case of FOMO. We made a conscious effort to eat what we can't get/have not seen in WA. Had a shredded duck bun, and the baby goat wrap thing - both are very yummy. We also bought some cold meats/ cheese/ lebanese dips/salads and bread to have at our hotel. Wished we had time to go again||September 4, 2017
Hatzlacha||50||I've been to a few city markets in the world. Definitions definitely vary, but Borough Market is one of the finest. It's over a significant expanse, allowing for great variation of offerings. It seems more of a market than a tourist trap, something many cities try to exploit poorly. Here you have multiple options for food, snacks, and other options to explore. If you're a foodie, I think you could spend a couple hours here, but overall I'd plan for 60+ minutes just to be able to walk all around the place (and still stop for a lunch on the go!). It is definitely something worth coming back to again.||September 3, 2017
Irishdancer1968||50||One of my favourite places in London. Loads of delicious stalls too many stalls with lots of lovely goodies to try. I love the cheese stalls!!!!||September 3, 2017
Doctor_G0nz0_||50||Fantastic selection of local fresh foods. Lots of great places to grab a take-away lunch as well. My favorite was the Boston Sausage burger. ||September 3, 2017
storm082||40||Having never been to borough market before when visiting London, we were very excited to visit. There is such a diverse range of Foods and produce on offer we were really won't be stuck for something to eat. Split over two sides of the road this really is the place you must visit to pick up very unusual produce and unique. ||September 3, 2017
64tommys||50||what a fantastic market ! i have visited on many occasions always enjoying the food and drink for sale ! some great cheeses,breads seafood and many more types of food. would definitely recommend this market !||September 3, 2017
Dxxxxxx||40||A summer Saturday just before lunch was probably a bad choice of time to visit, absolutely heaving to the point of difficult to move --- but the atmosphere is very upbeat - tourists, Londoners and locals all trying the free tasters, eyeing the unusual offerings and then picking what to eat.It's very food oriented, one end more speciality cheeses, oils, etc. the other more fresh veg and fish. Food stalls from pie and mash to Thali to oysters to falafel.Come hungry||September 3, 2017
slipslops1||50||Didnt actually mean to go as we were lost but very glad we did. Amazing food or every culture under one roof. Unfortunately we only had one stomach each. If you don't mind eating on street curbs with everyone else you'll love it. Lots of local council staff walking about with rubbish bags collecting plates/wrappers from you. We will return. Only down side is.. its very very crowded on a Saturday. ||September 3, 2017
SJField1||50||We had visited the Shard and stumbled upon this market...wow!!!Every town/city should have a market like this! The amount of fresh produce is unbelievable.We managed to try lots...gyoza...cheese...Everything was fab!Will definitely return when we're back in London for another trip.||September 3, 2017
33traveler2010||50||Loved walking around this market and tasting from the stalls. Great range of food and fun to walk around.||September 2, 2017
jas88_12||50||We visited the Market on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed! Wish we hadn't eaten lunch before we got there as there are some wonderfully eclectic food stalls selling all kinds of international food. On the whole most of the produce seems a little on the pricey side but you are in the centre of London in a tourist trap so not entirely unexpected. Would def go back again and try some of the street food.||September 2, 2017
John379||40||We went to the Borough Market on a recommendation from a waiter at our hotel. It was well worth the visit and we would highly recommend stopping by. It did get a little crowded around lunchtime but we were still able to move around pretty well. The shops were good, and so many foods to try and things to see. This is a must on our next trip to London.||September 2, 2017
samanthae850||50||Great markets with a wide range of food. So delicious, I had a meat pie & it was fantastic. Wide range something for everyone||September 2, 2017
Fosseboy||50||...and support those who work here and were subject to that atrocity. It is full of interesting stalls from all cultures. Food from the World. Great cheeses in particular.Old world charm. And Bridget Jones flat.Then walk to the river, turn left for the Tate Modern, right to see the Clink, Southwark Cathedral, under London Bridge to cafe Cote or the Galleria.||September 2, 2017
Matteozk16||50||When going to London you have to go to Borough Market, try and have lunch their and try the different foods that they have. Just spend some time walking around seeing the different booths.||September 1, 2017
Meander585321||50||Great place to try local food and shop for organic groceries. Lots of merchants but can get crowded at times especially in the morning. Bring cash because a lot of merchants don't take credit cards however some do. ||September 1, 2017
caddy1071||40||Lots of restaurants, but you'll get your best experience during the day when the market is in full swing. Definitely worth a trip is you're in the neighborhood.||August 31, 2017
danniellej111||40||Heard a lot of good things about Borough Market and it did not disappoint. Good space indoor and outdoor. They sell an array of fresh fruit, meats, seafood, cheese, sweet treats, fruit juices and the odd ornaments. Lots of tasty international food stalls to buy and eat, all very reasonably priced, i got a chicken, rice and veg dish for £5. Only thing lacking was a place sit down and eat the food, most people sat by the street outside the market which was ok as it was a nice day but wouldn't be any good if the weather was poor. That being said, in the outside market by the side there are a few food stalls and restaurants (smelt great) with seating areas if you bought food from them. Overall a great atmosphere and experience with great views of the Shard.||August 31, 2017
Christopher F||40||The only reason to come here is to sample a variaty of food and drink. Also a great place to pick up some street food for lunch.||August 31, 2017
Vazbo||50||What an amazing Market and you must visit when in London. A mix of street vendors selling every food you could imagine plus live demos of curries, paella, etc etc and the most amazing smells and atmosphere. You really could spend a fortune and the food and goods is of the highest quality. An experience in itself to wander around have a spot of lunch from the many street food stalls and generally just take in the atmosphere. Nearest tube station is London Bridge. We love it here and visit every time we are in London without exception!||August 31, 2017
FoodTravelingSnob23||30||Great food stalls like Middle Eastern, Ethiopian, Thai, Indian, Fish & chips, etc along with the traditional fruits, veggies & fresh flowers. One stall had homemade Sangria & Pimm's. Nice small market; the oldest market in all of London. I prefer Shoreditch/Bricklane food market more though because it's HUMONGOUS. Live music, fresh squeezed fruit juices of all kids, fabulous chocolates, the most exotic foods made before your eyes, etc. At least 2 huge warehouses are FULL of food stalls as well as outdoor courtyards & pedestrian streets lining the neighborhood. BEST "beigels" (bagels) in London are found here. The line is always long with at least 20-30 hungry tourists waiting for their chance to enter the tiny shop (with rude foreign women running the place). ||August 31, 2017
flashgordon2016||50||What a great experience for travelers who want to get a taste at a variety of cuisines from all around the world, Europe, across the Atlantic and even middle eastern gourmet.Many French products as well are sold over here as well as the surprising Philly cheese which is pretty extraordinary.||August 30, 2017
jamescJ6507VO||50||Fun place to visit. Vendors selling every kind of food that you could imagine. Bakeries, cheese, meat, wine and all sorts of small restaurants as well. Go there hungry!||August 30, 2017
R_J_Newbury||50||Our plan was to pop over have a quick look . Well little did we know we be there for several hours - lots of samples to try, enticing stalls with passionate stall-holders who could tell us everything about their meat and produce, lots of places to choose lunch and to end it all prosecco by the glass as you watch the market world go by. Amazing. ||August 30, 2017
Klapp2||40||The smells as soon as you walk in are over whelming, in a really good way. I would recommend getting some cash out and trying loads of different food and drink and soaking up the atmosphere here. A real gem of a place to visit in London.||August 30, 2017
450casperv||50||An absolute must visit when in London. The food is amazing and so many choices! Had the confit duck on a bread roll. Massive portion and stunning taste. Don't recommend visiting on a Monday or Tuesday as many of the stalls are closed. Highly recommended.||August 29, 2017
yahootraveler64||50||Unusual varieties of food--alligator, ostrich at one place--pig on a spit at another--wonderful breads and desserts--go for lunch and take some items home. Fish stalls have some of the freshest fish I've seen in a market.||August 29, 2017
KFGolferGal||50||Borough Market by the London Bridge is an exciting place to visit. I was expecting a flea market, however, it is interesting unusual food items and many take away food vendors. There are tables and chairs in a common area for eating. My wife and I had sausage sandwiches from one vendor for an early lunch and then came back later for a cheese and ham sandwich for a late lunch from a different vendor – all very good. Fun place to visit.||August 29, 2017
FledglingExplorer||50||Great place to go if you like all kinds of food. There's practically endless choice. Quite busy but that's to be expected in London, definitely worth facing the crowds.||August 29, 2017
DarrenofKent||50||We ate and drank our way through this market over a couple of hours. There is a great variety of food and drink choices and some hidden gem vendors. Be sure to wander down some of the less travelled aisles. We would do again if in the area.||August 29, 2017
johnnywallabe||50||London. My favourite city in the world. Having been born in this great city, we often neglect the beauties on our doorstep.Saturday, first day of my holiday and pure blue skies. A perfect day to catch up with friends.If you aren't familiar with the market then here's what you can enjoy:Food market - endless bread, cheese, cakes, pastries to buy Fruit and vegetables - layers of fruit, veg arranged in colourful displays which draw your eyes Food halls- foods of so many cultures from Indian to Italian. Meat to vegetarian Try the mac and cheese it's the most tastiest you'll find After exploring the markets and food you and take a glass of prosecco from the drink market or a seat in a local pubFinish the day by taking a fresh bunch of flowers home with you to remember your day||August 29, 2017
101wille||50||This represented our return to the market following the atrocities earlier this year. It was great to the market, it's vendors and the public unbound my the earlier events. Once again we enjoyed the energy and diversity of the market strolled at our leisure, drooled over stalls piled high every conceivable produce from dreamy black truffle to the equally dreamy doughnuts ( pick your flavour ).A cursory Road sign reminded the public that the Road was closed, otherwise security was low key, and the market had it's ebb and flow. It was great to return - well done everyone for restoring a normality - if that is the correct phrase!||August 28, 2017
lisabH3488MO||50||One of the best markets I have ever been too lots of stalls with loads of international cuisine very much worth a visit when staying in London , nice pubs around area too to quench the thirst ||August 28, 2017
BoMartin66||40||It is a nice place to go to for a while, but imho it suffers from being too crowded, too touristic and too expected.It is as if a city planner decided to set up a match making site where hipsters and tourists can meet.I really prefer the more haphazard food markets in Shoreditch where families from all over the world proudly make you taste their country's specialities and where you sit on plastic grass with foods that you can't pronounce and a beer bottle.||August 28, 2017
peterpaddockhurst||20||What was a lively fruit and vegetable market is now a tourist hot spot with over hyped and overpriced stalls and too many restaurants. The charm it once had has evaporated in noise and crowds. There are some good spots, like Lobos, to eat, but nothing is exceptional value . But it is on the visitor trail and with the Shard,Tower Bridge,Southwark Cathedral and the riverside walk nearby, the crowds won't stop coming!If you want an alternative market, try Maltby Street||August 28, 2017
margaretcP2480JJ||50||This never fails to disappoint the range of food, vegetables and pastries is superb. Street food at its very best and well located for a stroll down the south bank. I come every time I am in London||August 27, 2017
EllieandSherlock||50||Loved this Market ! All the food looked amazing but you can't try everything even though you may want to! We settled on trying the oysters and Cru champagne ! How delicious ! If you only have one thing, come to the oyster and champagne stall! Highly recommended!||August 27, 2017
jsteffenson||50||One of the best markets anywhere with some great vendors of all kinds especially food but also produce, meat, cheese, sweets, baked goods, flowers, spices, you name it. It's also a great venue for people watching, they every sort imaginable, great fun!||August 27, 2017
Miss Wallace W||40||Very busy at Christmas but there was the bonus of having all the December treats available like mulled wine and beers and florests with beautiful wreaths. The only downside to this market is the prices. expected...but it is a little disheartening having to pay nearly £5 for a glass of mulled wine when a restaurant closely would do it for half the price and you wouldn't be outside on a drizzly day ||August 26, 2017
Katie B||50||Amazing place. So many different cuisines. The smells are incredible. I usually let my nose guide me to a stall. Today it was chocolate brownies!||August 26, 2017
Triscopic||50||Borough market has every food imaginable. I found a liquorice stall and was happy, mummy found a shop dedicated to different and unusual spices, and we bought delicious and different fruits. That said, our 5 year old got very bored very fast. Not great with small children, but marvellous otherwise||August 26, 2017
rgnivala||50||Lovely space filled with interesting food shops and food vendors. Could easily eat your way through a day. Take a stroll across London Bridge and stop into Borough Market for food and/or dink even if you're not a foodie!||August 26, 2017
lmshaw1977||50||This is a great place to walk around and try a number of different foods from all over the globe. Everything I sampled was amazing. Great pubs nearby too.||August 25, 2017
ggeraldJr_||50||Went to the Borough Market slightly after lunch hour, expecting a smaller crowd. Plenty of fresh food options and a whole section of cheese and greens. The fish and chips along the road was huge and nicely fried. Price was fairly reasonable at £10, good for sharing around and grab other bites along the way. A must go when visiting London. Cheap and awesome grab-and-go food right in the city center. ||August 25, 2017
BradleySR73||50||We visited this market on the last day of our holiday and I wished I went on the first. The food was amazing and the prices reasonable given the quality of the produce. Just a short stroll from London Bridge Station. A MUST MUST visit for anyone who enjoys good food.||August 24, 2017
Basalt2003||40||Visited with daughter and my granddaughter along with her friend and daughter complete with two strollers. Busy and bustling with lots and lots of food outlets with all manner of choices. I went for a hot salt beef on rye sandwich which must have been the first I had had since umpteen years ago in Brick lane market further east.Memory isn't so good ( it was a long time ago) but I did have better sense of smell and taste then so todays offering fell a little short and cost a good bit more. We struggled a lot to find somewhere to sit in order to eat our various purchases and although it was midday lunchtime there weren't many and the one spot I found I had to vacate as market workers needed to move it so as to open up a larger eating area they were constructing - - - a little late in my opinion. I also found the staff on a stall selling various teas a little more interested in talking to themselves than serving me so I missed out on their wares! An overall nice enough experience and would be interested in visiting again but maybe not at lunchtime tho.||August 24, 2017
One_of_the_BOFs||50||One of the 'must visit' places for all visitors/tourists to London with any interest in food. There are quite a few great stalls to seek out, but one of my favourites has to be the coffee stall - they serve a really top notch flat white.||August 24, 2017
Ralph J||40||Really busy so if you don't like crowds don't go. Predominately a food market which is expensive but has some great sights & its wonderful watching people go around the place.Its free to get it & sample tasting is an art form!||August 24, 2017
Kermit3384||30||Visited this market for lunch - we had found it via Google as we didn't know what area to visit.Good points-1) wide range of foods2) some really unusual choices of food3) nice bustle and atmosphereNegative points1) limited seating, lots of standing round balancing food2) during our visits, toilets are small portacabins round the back which were dirty and the ladies' had a huge queue4) everything was overpriced for our northern tastes3) pest control setting up traps round behind the back was a little off putting when we were selecting our food||August 23, 2017
Colin E||40||I hadn’t visited for a while, the market seems unchanged. Most food outlets were busy on a Wednesday in mid-August. Not for the faint-hearted vegetarian, lots of fish and meat on sale, both cooked and uncooked. If an office worker from the local area, I would probably head to Flat Iron Square for lunch, there one is guaranteed a seat. At Borough Market, it is difficult to find anywhere to seat if buying from a stall.||August 23, 2017
Lisa S||50||Fantastic market and great atmosphere. Great food and plenty of places to sit down, have a drink and watch the world go by. The Golden Hind is close by too with views across the Thames. Love this place and visit every time I am in London. It is best to get of the tube at London Bridge which is the closest. Enjoy!||August 23, 2017
Brian B||50||Walked around Borough Market for lunch yesterday. I had been there before, but this time a friend was there to stop and view hundreds of food items !! The venue is brilliant for great food and if you like to try all sorts of items then this the place to go !! Last time my wife bought some hard Swiss cheese which lasts a long time and you grate it over other items to enhance it. We found the Swiss cheese !! the bought some very good Gouda and there were so many French cheeses, different various oils, parma ham, plus loads of other things. If I am in the area of London I always try and visit it again !!!||August 23, 2017
646ozgek||50||We had a great quick and delicious lunch for a decent price. Great place to taste different food. Lovely friendly people serving. ||August 22, 2017
ATK06||50||Borough Market has the best food !! We come here everytime as much as we can to enjoy the best food for a good price.. You can come here for your breakfast lunch and dinner.. good quality food from al around the world ||August 21, 2017
795blancac||50||Borough market is my favourite place in town. Its gourmet stores, its street food, its atmosphere, it's everything!!!I don't know if fortunately or unfortunately it's not so well known for tourists, but it does deserve a visit!!!||August 21, 2017
Stuttgartsnebula||50||great place, great food, great people. I even found amazing gluten-free cakes and cooking :) A must visit in London.||August 21, 2017
Liam B||50||One of my favourite places to visit in London, yes the beer is overpriced and It's always busy, but the smells are always fantastic and it's always a happy place! Best place for paella in London!||August 21, 2017
Stevie1954||30||When I entered the restaurant, we were welcomed with the words "Have you booked? " I thought why? Not that full and it's only a roast! In fact an overpriced one at that. I use a guide price of a Ribeye steak around £20 is fair, here more like £35.We both had a Wagoo Burger (£25) instead of having a Ultimate Roast Burger Roast beef with ale and mustard seed cheddar, pickled red cabbage, carrot piccalilli, curly kale and horseradish served on a roast potato, rosemary and garlic bunwith red wine onion gravy£18.50As we discovered only available Served Mon – Fri 12.00pm to 10.00pm & it was Saturday evening. The service was very good but had to repeat twice even to ask for a cider , as the waiter did not understand, they seem to be pushing the wine. We had a bottle of sparkling water , one cider and 2 Wagoo beef burgers with fries £68! Done! I have been to plenty of places including the Gourmet Burger kitchen and that meal would have cost half of that and bigger! Very pretentious for what it really was.||August 20, 2017
185armans||50||My paradise on earth in London. Get food from all over the world and enjoy the shops offering some of the best ingredients arou d||August 20, 2017
Willy W||40||Great food from local cuisine to Forren cultures. Really fun to see. A little brought down by the recent terror.||August 20, 2017
Trevor D||40||What a great atmosphere, crowds of people, but still plenty of room, wide variety of stalls and brilliant selection of food, both fast and traditional. There is a pub on the corner, so you can eat you chosen food then wash it down with a tasty beer, lager, cider, wine or soft drink.If you are in town then this place should be on your list to visit.||August 20, 2017
Liza F||50||Great food market there is a variety of products and cooked food to choose from. From meat and cheese to fruit and vegetables, even pastries everything looks mouthwatering it is worth a visit. The prices are an extra bonus ||August 20, 2017
YubaPrincess||40||Frankly, we put off our regular visits (out of fear). Fortunately, the market still buzzes with youthful vibe and great variety of produce. New stalls are up; but the old reliable ones (that sell fish&chips, freshly-shucked oysters, chorizo buns, and melted raclette on potatoes) are still present. Still highly recommendable.Tips: Grab a cuppa (and a chocolate truffle) at Monmouth Cafe nearby. Access the market from the Thames (Bankside where the Tate is) through a refreshing walk.||August 20, 2017
Gabriela G||50||Lots of options to choose from. Great produce, nice environment, you can try different things as you walk by the market. ||August 19, 2017
Rachel C||40||Great atmosphere, fantastic variety and just a lovely place to go!My only recommendation for improvement is to provide more seating areas for those who don't want to eat standing up and being jostled non stop!||August 19, 2017
suzzanne333||50||It was as usual a brilliant day with the hustle and bustle , I love being able to try so many different foods .And I love that it's so cosmopolitan.the varieties of food is excellent , they have vegetarian , vegan and so many other foods from different country's , the cheeses were amazing.I love going here at Xmas . ||August 19, 2017
TheTravelerJunkie||50||I only regret not finding this place sooner. It is a large area (mostly covered) with dozens of vendors selling fresh food and drinks. There are a few tables and chairs around but be prepared to stand and eat. There is something for everyone and I recommend trying multiple items from different vendors. You can pick up fresh cheese, bread, and desserts to take with you or stop by for lunch. AMAZING food!! I tried the pulled lamb and it was fantastic! I got a coffee to go from a barista stand that employs homeless people to help them get back on their feet. Such a great experience!||August 19, 2017
PRDallastraveler||30||We unfortunately had planned to go here for lunch on a Sunday - and the whole market was closed! Our fault for not researching ahead of time, but be forewarned that it is not an every day market!||August 19, 2017
Buddy54321||50||If your visiting London a must is Borough market ... Amazing place .. under cover, busy, loud exactly what you would expect and the food & crafts ... all brilliant, we stopped a tried oyster as fresh as fresh can be, the different meats, cheese, oils, cooked food, craft stalls ... all truly fantastic. It is closed on Sundays tho, But well well worth a visit ||August 18, 2017
Kendot52||50||The Borough Market was started in 1756 and is thriving today. It is a hodgepodge of unique stores and food retailers of every type. You can buy specialty teas in one booth, fresh flowers and vegetables in the next, and hand carved olive wood bowls in the next. Very eclectic venue. However, for me, one of the best parts were the food venders. Name a type of food or variety of food and it's probably here and available for purchase. The only negative for the Borough Market is the scarcity of places to sit and eat. There are some locations, but not nearly enough for the people there. Eating delicious food while standing is not that big of a problem. This is a must see location.||August 18, 2017
GoLiveYoung||50||Borough Market is one of the oldest and largest markets in London. It is well worth visiting for its huge range of produce. A great spot for lunch with its large selection of street food, cafes and bars. Perfect for afternoon drinks too. Loved the vibe of this London market.||August 18, 2017
harte87||50||Try to make it hear to be involved in this environment. You don't need to buy anything but you can freely look around.||August 18, 2017
AntDeniz||50||After circling the market about 3 times my partner decided on a Garlic and Prawn wrap which she enjoyed thoroughly - I however decided to opt for a Duck wrap. The pricing was a little steep, but I wasn't hungry until the following morning! However £1 for a bit of cheese seemed a bit cheeky. When in Rome....||August 17, 2017
mcsc-squared||50||Absolutely great place to come for a leisurely lunch. Lots of great eating options - seafood, Indian, Croatian (first time for me), German, middle eastern, cheese stands, tea & coffee places, ... and so much more. Loved the place. I wish we could have eat much more. Very crowded- but that added to the ambience. ||August 17, 2017
Barsn||50||You can find anything you want from fresh cooked food to pastries and other tasty foodIt's a very busy market and you won't know from where to start tasting Recommended to pass by and then grab a beer in the bars next to the place||August 17, 2017
rickyspa1||40||This is probably one of the top ten delicatessen markets in Europe and it offers great atmosphere (a bit crowded during weekends) and it is really more a place to eat and drink than shop. Everything is too expensive but it offers great quality. If you like markets, this is a very good place to go||August 17, 2017
kirkgirl||40||We were staying just the other side of London Bridge and visiting the Globe theatre in the evening so this was a perfect spot for an early evening stroll, a bite to eat and a glass of wine. We were here around 5.30 on a sunny Saturday evening and the place was absolutely buzzing, great atmosphere. It was great to see so many people back here and offering their moral and financial support to the traders after what must have been a very tough couple of months lately. Came back again another evening before we left town. Great spot if you like to graze on delicious food and hang out in cool bars!||August 17, 2017
dgosul||40||It seems like it's a tourist trap , very busy here, lots of stalls selling freshly cooked food, lots of different smells, pretty overpowering really.||August 17, 2017
Anouj||50||If you are visiting London, make sure to pass by Borough market to eat some delicious cheese, fudge and plants of desserts.||August 16, 2017
JaimeEatsMusic||40||Vendors selling olive oil, cheeses, seafood, meats, spices, wines, and other goodies. A lovely place to wander and take in the smells and tastes of quality foods, definitely worth an afternoon. I would, however, caution against the Roast food vendor. We were excited to try a scotch egg, something we were told is not to be missed as tourists in London, but it was over cooked. Another vendor was also selling scotch eggs and we saw that theirs were properly cooked with the yolk left soft, as it is intended.||August 16, 2017
Didrick||20||This really is a bit of a tourist trap in the financial and the literal sense of the word. Tuesday morning, however, it's not busy so at least you can get in and out and walk around. We popped in for an early lunch. One sickly hog roast roll served up on dried up bread by a rude man and a lightly packed stale fallafel wrap later and we realised we'd made a mistake. There are some great food stalls here, I guess we were unluckly. Felt like and tasted like we'd both got leftovers from the night before. Probably had.||August 16, 2017
Arvind P||40||A very colourful market in London with a lot of options for food, drink and items to purchase. The area is really nice with some interesting products.||August 16, 2017
DeCluttering2018||40||This is a vibrant place, very crowded, difficulty sitting to eat but worth it. The ONLY thing is that there is not enough British food. So many tourists who are probably eating food from their own countries. Maybe this is why they love it. Personally I can highly recommend the Ethiopian 'street food' - just wonderful! There is far too much Comte cheese - mature, mature, very mature, very very mature - just too much, where are all the British cheeses? There are very few. Borough Market is well worth visiting though, the fruit and veg are much cheaper than any of the supermarkets. The place has a buzz and everyone is relaxed, a lovely atmosphere. Walk along the Thames to it, you will never tire of that view and the party atmosphere along the South Bank. There are some great eating places dotted around the market and on the Thames walk too.||August 16, 2017
TheFreenes||50||Please support the guys at the markets after the recent atrocity played out by evil morons. The food is absolutely fantastic and the array is simply outstanding. Make sure you time your visit because at peak times, especially around 1230 - 1330 hrs, this place is packed. Go around 1130 or 1200, or arrive for a late lunch, to avoid big crowds - no matter what day you are there. Don't expect fine, seated dining, but do expect tasty food, accommodating sellers and an awesome selection. Bring cash not credit cards as the sellers will appreciate this more - and some don't have eftpos facilities. Try not to bring strollers but if you do have to time your arrival to avoid crowds.||August 15, 2017
Jan s||50||Our accommodation is so close, we popped in for a lunch snack today, then called in again for a selection of cold meats, cheeses, bread, olives and tomatoes for our dinner tonight. Not a particularly big market, but everything on offer seems to be of a really high quality and interesting. I plan to visit again before we leave London!||August 15, 2017
Garima S||50||As a tourist when you enter this place you have no idea what is about to hit BUT you will be pleasantly surprised. After walking from Tower Bridge all the way to the station opposite Borough market and spotted it quite by chance. Was super hungry so entered hoping to get something to eat. Man did I eat, you get all kinds of food here from Indian, Chinese, Mexican, Turkish, Greek, Italian EVERYTHING you can possibly eat and more||August 15, 2017
811Catherine52||50||Really difficult to choose what to eat since the choice is really big. There is something for everybody. Very full and busy. Shame that there are not really enough places to put a plate down, basically you have to stand & eat which can be difficult.||August 15, 2017
schmidtmg||50||We strolled through Borough Market for breakfast goodies on two mornings, just after the stands opened. Great place for fresh food, bread, cheese , fish, vegetables , fresh juices, coffee, etc. There are food stands showcasing the cuisine of many countries and regions - from Sicily and the Middle East to Germany. In the streets around the market is an abundance of cafés, bars and restaurants, hugely popular with locals after work and thus packed. The prices in and around the market are not cheap, but good quality produce has its price....||August 15, 2017
503JonG||40||This is a cracking place to have a wonder around for a few hours at lunch, great atmosphere with plenty of amazing places to eat, drink and shop!! Will be going back the next time we are in London!||August 14, 2017
chefchirilaandreia||50||Awesome market with an excited variety of fresh food.Here I found everything starts from local sellers of english cheese to russian stand with very nice tips of bread.||August 14, 2017
mha404||40||First time we have spend any time on the South Bank and we wanted to visit Borough Market. Walked from Westminster Bridge which was delightful and wandered around Borough Market. Wander around on a Saturday is not really possible, squeeze, nudge and gently shove and you will enjoy the visit. Food is fantastic but not cheap, however they have to make a living too. The fresh food stands were great, crocodile, kangaroo, ostrich or good old fashioned meat steaks were around. Cheeses stall abound ands some lovely breads - funnily enough we couldn't find olives, sun dried tomatoes and the like. Really enjoyed it but don't try to cover it in a hurry.||August 14, 2017
Shula02||50||I can no longer count on my hands how many times I've been to Borough market. Amazing place!!!!!!!! What is this place not doing that it can do better??? NOTHING!!!! It's amazing!!!! The food, the atmosphere, the people!!!! I love it so much When I have visitors from anywhere, I always take them to Borough market, and they love it as much as I do. They not only do street food, they also have sections for fresh produce. So you can come and get good quality fruit, veg, artisan bread, cheese, meat, basically everything and anything. I can't express how fantastic this place is, you just have to go. The crowds it attracts on a daily basis speaks for itself. I wish took some photos when I go, but I'm so busy enjoying myself I always forget ||August 14, 2017
lozliz7||50||First time we've visited Borough Market and we weren't disappointed. Arrived just before lunchtime on a Saturday so it was pretty busy but there are so many food stalls it doesn't matter how busy it is as you never have to queue for long.All of the food we tried was great quality - salt & pepper squid, salt beef bagel & some of the drunk cheese... plus all of the fresh fish & meat stalls looked amazing - wish it was our local market!Also had some great cider on one of the stalls. We could've spent a good few hours here, will definitely return. ||August 13, 2017
517franklinm||50||My husband and I had a great time at Borough Market. High recommend! We bought food from several places which was delicious and left us stuffed. There are so many wonderful food stalls in the market to explore. We enjoyed lamb rice bowls, paella, and a lovely cider during our visit. We also picked up a few gifts at a spice shop and honey stand. I wish I'd been able to buy the delicious cheeses and fruits that we saw but we were staying a hotel.||August 13, 2017
happy_shopper_0||50||I have been to borough market several times and every time I discover something new. From the fabulous cheeses, oils and smoothies, the knowledgeable and helpful staff to the amazing restaurants located nearby, Roast is an absolute must (even if you can only manage roast on the go) and black & blue is lovely. I would go in the week if you want to avoid the crowds (it's always very busy on a Saturday) but an absolute must when in London.||August 13, 2017
EAN44||50||I now work in London and due to Waterloo being shut I go to London Bridge and walk, the delightful part is waking through this market as it's gets ready for its day of trading first the architecture has changed little from when it was built and it has a charm of old London mixed with the 21st century of trading, there are so many stalls of food and the smells are wonderful, you can pick up breakfast on the way and it's takes you back to the London of old, it's well worth a visit but at lunch time it's packed as everyone heads to the market for their daily intake. After the horrible events the market is back to its best.||August 13, 2017
ClareBarton||50||First time to Borough Market, great atmosphere, really good fun. The food was amazing, loved it. Try the Hog roast it was fabulous||August 12, 2017
N1810JAandyp||40||We had booked a hotel close to Borough Market and decided to walk through it and it was amazing. The place was packed on a Friday evening with food stalls from around the world, which the children were able to experience, fish stalls that amazed them and people out to have a good time. We loved the sights and sounds of the market and the friendliest welcome from all of the stall holders. ||August 12, 2017
Chris H||40||We visit London every year as we have a daughter son in law and grandkids who live in London. No visit would not be complete without going to the Borough Market. The produce and food stalls are all first class certainly not the cheapest but you are paying for quality food at its best. The market is very close to the Tower of London,the Tower Bridge and HMS Belfast so spending a day or two in this area is well worth it. The market is right at the London Bridge tube station so it is very easy to get to.||August 12, 2017
CheyenneAshton||50||It's the second time I visit Borough Market. My mummy and sister discovered it for the very first time. Grabbed some great food to eat ! (thai, cakes, etc). Moreover, it's a great place to stop before or after visiting the Southwark Cathedral, London Bridge and other tourist spots. ||August 11, 2017
HoodedBanoonigan||50||Spent a day visiting London's mind blowing array of attractions, and this came out as the day's standout highlight. Foodie heaven, hugely popular, a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach. Chalk this up as an absolute must on your trip to London. Pork on spit with crackling a moment of pure bliss.||August 11, 2017
MaddyTaylorBingham||50||I visited borough market with my family and everybody loved it. It's a phenomenal experience and it really introduces you to new cultures, foods, and things that might not be in America. As soon as you walk up there's fresh fruit everywhere and pots of curry and paella. Once you go there for the first time all you want to do is go back. It's an experience that you need to have.||August 11, 2017
982lucyh||50||Lovely market with amazing food on offer. Such a lovely atmosphere and if you want somewhere a bit different, visit here!||August 11, 2017
ngofam||40||It's like a market you go to get your supplies of groceries and food - meat, salami, cheese, fresh fruits, fresh meat, jams, cakes, deserts, etc. Many stalls selling cooked food like German hotdogs, burgers, pasta, European food, hog meat, pulled lamb, Asian Laksa, and many fruit juice stalls and coffee stalls. Worth a visit to satisfy your yearnings for English food. Supposedly the best doughnut is here too.||August 11, 2017
Matteo G||50||I have been in Borough Market to have an easy Lunch with friends. The place is very nice, you can find every type of food and drink. Then you can enjoy your street food walking along the Thames or just having a rest at market site. My Lunch was a sandwich with pork. The food was great!!!!||August 10, 2017
Ricky B||40||borough market is a great place to visit if in the area, food available from different cultures( London prices), A selection of stalls selling bread, cakes,cheeses, fish, meat drink, fresh fruit and veg. The market is in two halves and if you have a couple of hours to spare its well worth the visit.||August 10, 2017
Michael B||50||The best food market in London. Crowded but with good atmosphere. Best for launch. Can find everything. Very recommended.||August 10, 2017
Eva S||50||Excellent food stalls. Kappacasein Dairy grilled cheese sandwich was delicious! Flower stall were beautiful. We could have spent the entire day eating at this foodie heaven market.||August 10, 2017
Corrine R||50||Been to London several times and never came here, I've actually been a few feet from the market and did not realize it was there! This London trip I found it by mistake as I was staying in Lodging nearby. I wanted to try a new Cafe and Monmouth was our destination. But it was so overcrowded we never made it in, and happily walked the market instead. And within the market we were able to find coffee stands.The market has so much flavors, aromas, free samples, goodies, ect. Even just window shopping it is not a place that you can easily run through. You're eye will be captivated by the many vendors. Come hungry, but realize even so, that may be dangerous to your purse! But never fear, there is an ATM on site. (Cash Only!) Our group bought banana bread, one of the best brownies we've ever had, almond croissants, choizo, and basalmic. We enjoyed several free samples of cheese, basalmics, chorizo, cookies, fudge, smoothies, curry, and jambalaya! The one downside is half the market is not covered and it did start to rain during our visit, and all the umbrellas in confined squished space are dangerous.. Secondly there are no public restrooms. But the restaurants nearby will allow you to use the loo with a purchase.||August 10, 2017
kents518||40||Here you can try out lots of food from different countries around the world. What we tasted when we where there was really good. The market is a little crowded.||August 9, 2017
deliacoburn||50||Roast in Borough Market is the place to be for Sunday Lunch. Excellent service, very good quality food and a jazz band to boot.||August 9, 2017
matthfd||50||Great place to try lots of different types of food and people watch. Kids loved walking around the different food stalls before choosing what they wanted to eat. Will be back!||August 9, 2017
Linnel_M||40||Great atmosphere! I had a lovely time wandering around tasting all the food, people watching and a glass of wine.||August 9, 2017
chris f||50||Get there early; it gets crowded later in the day. Amazing collection of food markets to suit all tastes. There is fresh fruit and veg, freshly baked bread and doughnuts, cheese, spices, ice cream, cheesecakes and sea food. My favourites are the giant merengues and huge slabs of chocolate available. You can buy ingredients to take away, or there is a huge array of street food from a wealth of cultures cooked to order, from curry and shredded duck rolls, to paella and chilli. If you have time, book an evening table in "Roast", a wonderful restaurant upstairs which overlooks the market. Although lunch time is less formal, evenings are more special; a white tablecloth/napkin affair and a little pricey for some, but the sharing roast beef platter melts in your mouth and is to die for!||August 8, 2017
Linda B||50||whenever in London, I am sure to visit Tate Modern followed by Borough Market. Remember to take cash, or there's an ATM outside. My favorite lunch is 2 booths next to each other,One serves hot fila dough filled with spinach and cheese. Also homemade hummus. Next to him is veggie burgers, several kinds to choose from all to die for. Top it off with a chocolate chip displayed in huge piles. They also have white chocolate, but I don't consider that the real thing. I sit towards the back where there are benches and don't want to talk to anyone while I indulge. I sit with my daughter and we both say,"don't talk to me!"||August 8, 2017
yuane909||50||Borough Mark真的超好逛的，有超多的handmade 讓我品嚐到連鎖或餐廳外的滋味，還可以看到很多平常不易見到的食材。像是第一次看到白色的currants、Pecorino、不同熟成度的cheese、各式的風乾火腿、黑白松露、不同的香料及岩鹽等，都讓我驚奇連連。如果要我推薦London 旅遊的話，擇一天到Borough Mark，會有許多專屬於自己的驚奇與深刻感受。||August 8, 2017
JoanRuff||50||Such a diverse selection of food vendors--many offering free samples which is super wonderful. It would be a challenge to leave without purchasing something. We proceeded to walk along the Thames and enjoyed our snacks on the river near the millennium bridge||August 8, 2017
Pamela H||50||Went to Borough Market and it didn't dissapoint. A huge selection of cheese, oils, meats, and some of the most unusual food stuffs I have seen. Fabulous selection of fruit and vegetables and then food from the stalls just put the icing on top of the cake. A very enjoyable morning and lots of tasters to tempt you to buy.||August 8, 2017
nickpickles||40||Well ,this is a foodie experience to match any in London, sadly too busy unless you get there early. There is a riot of colour and choice with impressive artisanal outlets, some with prices to match. It was lovely to see the old buzz was still there, after the recent atrocity.||August 8, 2017
139annemiekj||40||Lovely place to go, with all types of cuisines and good food. The building in which Borough Market is located is beautiful! It was really busy on the Saturday we visited, so eating your food is less convenient and cosy (needed to stand). ||August 8, 2017
Darren J||50||What a lovely market and very vibrant with all the various cultures, you can virtually buy anything here, and so many food stalls to choose from as well. I would definitely recommend visiting this place.||August 8, 2017
Anna C||40||Great place to browse and try different food stalls. I especially loved the truffle oil, fresh juices and of course had to have a scotch egg. ||August 8, 2017
Johnwish||50||This is a buzzing place and full of such an eclectic mix of foods from all over the world.. it is nicknamed Londons larder for its pedigree of supplying the best foods to the capital. Definitely worth a visit .. I would combine it with a trip into Southwark cathedral (historic cathedral with links to Shakespeare) and the George inn ( historic pub with links to dickens and beyond.. one of the last galleried inns in England ) both are on borough markets doorstep||August 8, 2017
gssanju||50||Absolutely fantastic place who loves to try variety of food all around the world in one place!!! Spicy or not, fruit or sweets, meet or chees you can try here.. I had ithiopion beef portion for the first time and it was really good who likes spicy food!!! ||August 7, 2017
BT993TT||50||After our visit to London Tower in the morning, we walked to Borough Market for lunch. It is was about a 20 minute walk and what an interesting market. You can shop for things like fruit, vegetable, seafood or look for various types of food and drinks or dessert. We enjoyed the Ethiopian food and the Roast Hog stalls. Ice cream was nice from Greedy Goat. Fresh juices and coffee are readily available too. Overall, a very nice stop!||August 7, 2017
Malcolm P||50||I used to work in this area 30 years ago when it was a fruit and veg market and a supplier for shops across London. Now a place well worth visit to see many vendors offering good quality food and drink both to eat while walking and to take home. great ambiance and well worth the visit||August 7, 2017
horwood_20||40||We decided to make a visit to Borough Market after seeing how they coped with the London Bridge Terror attack, our son was on HMS Belfast on the night of the attacks with his Scouts.The market was tremendous and the smell of fresh fruit and vegetables, the bread and street food brought back so many memories of childhood shops. The stalls were really busy and it was good to see. London is certainly OPEN. Everywhere was clean.||August 7, 2017
rachelbN6069OI||50||Great buzzing market, mainly food, nice wine place to stop and watch the world go by. Not open Sunday. ||August 7, 2017
jo_rennie||50||This place was just amazing. The smells, the taste of the food, the atmosphere the people. Way exceeded by expectations! Can't wait to come back the next time I am visiting London.||August 7, 2017
rayrest||50||A real vibrant market under cover inside a huge warehouse with many entrances. A vast array of stalls selling many different goods. The atmosphere is fantastic in here and you get a real feel of London.||August 7, 2017
985chanc||50||Great variety and quality of food here. Nice atmosphere too, with street music performances. It is open til 3pm daily for lunch.Head over to the bar at the corner to wash down lunch with a nice pint of ale!||August 6, 2017
wintzz||40||We thought we would walk through Borough Market as a means to getting near the Thames and south side from our trip up the Shard ,but stayed for and hour or so tantalised but the different foods and samples offered by the friendly market traders especially the oysters !!  The market has a great verities of food from around the world to take home , try or have a meal , worth going to if your in the area and a must for all foodies ||August 6, 2017
RyanM7105||50||Make sure to come only when its open (wed-sat). We came back from our last visit, and everything is still very good. Wife and children really liked the food. Everything was so good and its now practically filled with tourists. Wife liked the food.||August 5, 2017
joshuaj605||40||My favourite bits are all the artisan chocolates around here, its nice for an hour to wander around. Worth a visit if you're passing through Central London. Plenty of other food pop as well.||August 5, 2017
ilanai-nl||50||The Borough Market is awesome! I wish my local market had all the products that are on offer at this market! Might not have seen all of it, but the market has a great section of exotic streetfood, great for lunch or an early dinner. Other then that there is a lot of fresh produce, specialty cheeses, spices, handmade fresh pasta's and lots of bakery's, coffee makers, smoothie stands and other sweet suppliers ;-)We came early, around ten on Saturday, and found the market nice and quiet. Had breakfast by getting a smoothie here and a coffee there, while strolling around. Next time we'll make sure to stop by around lunch time!||August 5, 2017
SFIMedia||40||We spent a lovely few hours here perusing the wares (mostly artisan food and drink) and tasting samples. It is definitely a tourist market these days but the goods are high quality and the architecture still gives you the feel of what it would have been like back in the day. It is right next to Southwark Cathedral too. We sat on a barrel and drank prosecco and then had some Indian Street Food from a stall at the back which was delicious. There was live music playing and it had a good vibe. There is an indoor seating area for those who wish to relax and eat something from a stall with more music at weekends.||August 5, 2017
Kevin H||50||We stumbled upon the market around lunch and enjoyed finding so many options! We tried a few things and all were quite good, we'll be back next trip to London! ||August 4, 2017
violet339||50||Borough Market is one of my favourite places in London. I never get bored of it. There's such a great atmosphere and so many different foods to try. Some of my favourite dishes are the chorizo roll from Brindisa and the Shetlands salt and pepper squid from Furness Fish, and the cheese stalls are fantastic. The stall holders are very friendly and there're always loads of tasters with no pressure to buy. It's very clean with plenty of bins about. I would avoid Saturdays at all costs as you simply can't move. My one gripe is that you used to take the food you'd bought and sit in the grounds of Southwark Cathedral to eat it. It seemed like a bit of a tradition. Now it's all closed off and you can't do this anymore so you have people awkwardly trying to eat standing up, which doesn't look fun.||August 4, 2017
BigFatBudgie||20||Luckily, we didn't plan on visiting here , it happened to be by Southwark Cathedral (which we had just visited). So this is the great Borough Market ? (Not). Very unimpressed. Cramped, absolutely heaving with people, packed like Sardines in a tin. Thank heavens it wasn't raining. Had to stand up to eat 'traditional ' Indian street food that was full of mashed potato???? (I thought potatoes originated from the Americas?)Think trendies will love Borough Market. Overpriced & overrated. ||August 3, 2017
JBeverley||50||Always pop in for fantastic cheeses( especially the truffle one) ,stunning mushroom pate and truffle oils. Will keep supporting this fantastic market.||August 2, 2017
815simoneb||50||One of the best London market, it is a good place to go there is always people, great food and fresh ingredients. It is always a good experience. ||August 2, 2017
tjsk8||50||Lots of fantastic street stalls offering a huge variety of food, so much so, it took the children ages to choose lunch. Their roast hog sandwiches were delicious. We started looking for lunch at 11.45am, which turned out to be a good time as the market was very busy, naturally, at lunch time.The market was very clean and felt safe.||August 2, 2017
985markq||50||Walked through on way to the clink. What an amazing place. Food choices unbelievable. From all over the world. Drinks shops and stalls are ao diverse. A fantastic place to visit. The smell is intoxicating||August 1, 2017
jogibbo||50||As a keen cook Borough Market was always on the bucket list. Today it surpassed all expectations. Just loved the smells, the vibe, the diversity of everything on offer. I had my very first vegan meal, which was something to behold as a total carnivores. Sensational food. My husband and ten year old daughter ate too and loved it. It is a great place that should be on anyone's must do visit list when in London. Cannot wait to go back.||August 1, 2017
658emily||50||I love this place is so friendly and the food is amazing such a mixture and all are very helpful with foods if you need to try new things and great for children to explore there taste buds||August 1, 2017
Peter_wiwi||40||On route with my bicycle between London Liverpool Street and Waterloo train stations and lucky enough to stumble across this lively food market at lunch time well worth a visit with any number of cuisines to tempt you. ||August 1, 2017
AdamWH||50||We didn't read much into Borough Market but decided we would pay it a visit at some point during our stay and ended up going twice. It has a real good vibe and feel as you walk around, there is some fantastic produce on offer, especially cheeses! The sites, smells and tastes are well worth a visit!||August 1, 2017
Brittanny B||50||A local told me about this place and I was definitely not disappointed! Walking in you can smell the different types of food on offer, the market offers a lot of types of food and all are great! I had a smoothie and seafood paella and they were fantastic.||July 31, 2017
barneywoodham||50||I visit Borough Market every time I go to London. If you like markets it is great just to wander round the different stalls to see the variety of food on offer ranging from great cheese to wonderful cakes. Also there are a good number of street food traders there so a god place to eat as well. It does get very busy but it is surrounded by decent pubs and restaurants so a visit is not wasted.||July 31, 2017
NavG||40||This market has stall and a very local feel. It is a small market next to the Southwark Cathedral with east access by tube. Fresh unique food stalls with coolies etc..||July 30, 2017
flyfishn||50||Wow the selection of foods.We had fresh raw oysters, fresh melted Raclette on new potatoes.Wish we had tried the goat ice cream.So so many choices.Also the fresh cured sausages.My favourite was the chocolate, blood sausage.My 2 cts,Hope this helps.||July 30, 2017
Andrew W||50||My wife and I LOVE Borough market. So many to look at. So many good smells. We were going to share something for lunch and ended up eating LOADS of different food from the different stalls. A really fun atmosphere. If you have a couple hours in your trip use them here around lunch time. You won't regret it. ||July 30, 2017
Lynne A||50||A fantastic way to spend a morning picking up cheeses, meats, fish and breads etc. An amazing selection of butchers, fishmongers and cheese shops. Lots of hot street food too to snack on the way round. I always pick up fresh pasta, giant red prawns, sliced Italian meats and a truffle. A weekly must. ||July 30, 2017
JKLS72||50||While on vacation we stopped here for "lunch". The market has an awesome assortment of food vendors. You have bakeries, cheese sellers, and pastry vendors that are great to stop and get some yummy food. There are all a lot of vendors that serve hot lunches, I had the vegetarian Indian street food for lunch which was great. Others in the family sopped and had a pulled pork sandwich and a burger. All the food was excellent. The market gets really crowded but it is a great place to walk around and try all kinds of different food.||July 29, 2017
ajdrssw2015||50||My son introduced me to this fantastic , vibrant, exciting place. He lives in London and has been here many times. The smells, sounds and atmosphere is unique. The foods that are on offer look delicious . The people who work on the stalls are so friendly and happy in their work. Wonderful place. Highly recommend it. A must visit when in London . ||July 29, 2017
Hash29||40||Can totally recommend doing this food tour. Borough Market is a fantastic place. I was traveling solo, and met some nice people. Lots of food, great fun, our guide Matt was friendly and did a great job in keeping us informed and entertained.||July 28, 2017
Carsten N||50||If you are near, don't miss this chance to stuff your face with some delicious street food! With so many great options it can be hard to choose. I tried roasted wild boar in ciabatta bun. So tasty! Much flavour! ||July 28, 2017
205ren_d||50||What a delight to walk around this market.Everything looked delicious and the smell was making me hungry.So many delicatesses and all presented with passion.Lost my time here, but I stayed here with pleasure.||July 28, 2017
delaney2141||50||Tasty food with a fantastic friendly atmosphere As soon as you walk down the steps the smell hits you! MmmmmmmYou just don't know where to look because it looks and smells soooooo good! It's like walking into a very different part of London ! It was lovely and warm welcoming Will definitely go againMmmmmm yummy||July 28, 2017
JabbaT25||50||Come to Borough market every time I'm in London, amazing place! 2 minute walk from London Bridge Station and surrounded by famous attractions such as The Shard, HMS Belfast, Shakespeare Globe and Tower Bridge is only a 15 minute walk along the river side, great area of London to be in. The food here is amazing, had a Malaysian curry this time which was about £6/£7, worth every penny and of course the doughnuts from Bread Ahead are not to be missed!! They've gone up from £2.50 to £3.00 a doughnut though.||July 28, 2017
carjams||40||Sometimes i find this market just a little to busy. I'm not someone that likes queuing. However it's still a cool place with lots of lovely things to look out. The food is amazing and It's in expensive. Don't pass by. Close to Southwark Cathedral.||July 27, 2017
CJAmore||50||Truly enjoyed spending hours here. So many things to see and try. A variety of vendors to purchase from. We tried a lamb salad, a hazelnut donut (so yummy), a sangria, as well as some Chinese food at a restaurant at the edge of the market. Everything was so yummy! Will go back when in London.||July 26, 2017
Hizkuntza||50||Yes come here (early, don't be lazy otherwise it will be packed) for food! Try all the food form around the world and do come to do your shopping once in the lifetime at least.Cheese, Fish, Veggies and Meat selection are one of the best in town. In fact if you come early enough you'll see how some restaurants and some owners are waiting for their deliveries circa 4am!Try Neil's Yard for cheese (huge selection) and Montmouth for a great coffee! The winery next to them is also really good.||July 26, 2017
Zee1979||40||Wide variety of foods to suit most people's tastes. Prices reasonable for London but a little more upmarket than your average market stalls.||July 26, 2017
Dundercheese||50||London has some great places to nosh but this is the best anywhere. Something for everybody. No junky food just the best cheese, chartucuterie, breads, olives, prepared items for lunch from all over the world. I could go on forever. I love coming here and eating my way around the world||July 26, 2017
angelawN6162MZ||40||Great street food. Continental cheeses and coffee what more could one ask for. Great place to hang out during lunch with friends.||July 26, 2017
JTNB2014||50||Fantastic, such an amazing varied food market, from fresh figs, black truffles to the oddest looking fish and even a whole stall dedicated to cheesecakes - yummy. Plus so many varied foods being cooked from all around the World to eat on the spot delicious. Plus the market itself is architecturally fascinating too. Definitely worth a visit. ||July 26, 2017
JanV253||50||This is more than a market. You'll find all kinds of exclusive produce here, as well as food stalls where you can order excellent snacks. Worth a visit when you're in for a break from Tate Modern of before or after a visit to Shakespeare's theatre||July 25, 2017
drw2112||50||We had this on our to do list for London. We walked from the Tower Bridge to the London Bridge to here, so we built up our appetite.A mixture of all kinds of food with every taste in mind. We tried a couple of local things, and a couple of things that we didn't know what to expect. Overall a great eating experience. The only bad thing is there really is no place to sit, so you probably will end up standing while eating. It was well worth it!!!||July 25, 2017
mtdad||50||I love markets like Borough Market and seek them out wherever I travel. Borough has the best food of any market that I have been to. My wife and daughter loved the pot pies and I had a wonderful lamb gyro. At lunchtime, the lines are very long, but they move people through very quickly. My only warning is that if you aren't a fan of extremely crowded spaces, this probably is not the place for you. If you can handle it, the treats and food are well worth it.||July 25, 2017
garylim88||40||What a place to go!!! A must for any tourists that visiting the first time. The food is good and varieties are superb.I reduced to 4 stars rating is because of the birds that doing aerial bombing of their waste. In a area of selling food, I find hygiene matters are hard to control.||July 25, 2017
dionrenee||50||We went to Borough on our last day and it was an attack of the senses in a good way. All of the different aroma's from pastries and bread to pork and fish, it was crazy good. If you are a foodie this is the place to go. If I lived in London I would be here every weekend!! Take cash! Also there is an ATM right in the middle of the market : )||July 25, 2017
standrews47||50||years ago this would have been a place for locals to get the fresh produce, now although you can get pretty much what you would need,, its more geared at tourism, the place was heaving but didnt have to wait too long at the stalls to get food, so much to chose from you will probably take a while to decide what to try.||July 25, 2017
suehN480BS||50||We were visiting The Shard and popped along to see Borough Market. Unfortunately it is not fully open on Mondays so go later in the week but do go and take a big appetite. The only problem will be deciding what to choose while listening to the brilliant buskers. Great experience and we would go again on another day.||July 25, 2017
Owlincallington||40||We have just visited Borough market for the first time, it is a very good place and would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't so busy, there were too many people there making getting around impossible. There are foods from all around the world and you are able sample some things before you buy. Will make sure we visit early next time.||July 25, 2017
De0nnaH||50||This is a hidden gem. You would not believe the amount of food under one roof. You need to look around and then decide what you want to eat as you turn every corner and there is something different. Wonderful place||July 24, 2017
Blueskiesstevie||50||If you only visit one market while in London then make sure it's this one. It's strictly a food market but it has so much more to offer in terms of atmosphere, location & memories. Grab a glass of prosecco at 10 in the morning a walk around sampling the different foods on offer. Get some bread & cheese or grab lunch on one of the many food stalls. I Prefer the old Thames side inn pub just around the corner where you can sit down & eat or the Hawksmoor for the best steak. If you get there when the market opens your'll have the place to yourself for a couple of hours before it becomes packed which can be nice except most of the bars along the river won't open until mid day.||July 24, 2017
connier377||50||There is such a wonderful atmosphere. Be sure to go on a morning on a weekday if you have the chance to, because it gets kind of crowded on the weekends. But definitely a must to visit. If it's crowded, there are also quite cute shops around and the direct neighborhood. Really a quarter to cool down.||July 24, 2017
ClareMcK||50||We must have been crazy to pitch up on a Saturday lunchtime as it was rammed with people enjoying the best the market had to offer. And it was raining too.There is so much to choose from when you pop in for a snack. I chose something from Balkan bites; their popular Spinach and Cheese dish. Followed by a Chelsea Bun from BreadAhead. Both items were huge and shared with my partner.It is busy on a weekend so you must be prepared to be jostled and moved along. Two stall holders did not like that people were shelter from the rain behind and in front of their stands. Fair enough really.If you are a foodie you will want to make this your primary destination. You will be food heaven!||July 24, 2017
931wendyv||50||This market is a must do in London. Lots of delicious food stands. You must try the fudge stand of Whirld, best fudge ever!||July 23, 2017
GLOBAL69||50||We had such a good time here. You can get your beer and drink in the street while rubbing elbows with locals.No kids||July 23, 2017
Island-Mavericks||50||London's first class food scene is perhaps no better represented than by Borough Market, with over a hundred stalls and incredible street food vendors offering cuisines from the four corners of the globe. As a self proclaimed foodie, I was in heaven. This is without a doubt the best market I've ever been to. Can't wait to return.||July 23, 2017
Buba J||50||We visited this market accidentally, while walking along Bankside, and loved it at first sight. It is full of atmosphere created by thousands of curious tourists bustling around the stalls and boots that offer fresh fish and seafood, wines, cheeses, pastry, honey, vegetables, fruits and freshly squeezed juices. Although there are not enough seats and tables outdoors, manage to find a place to sit, relax, chew your meal, sip your drink and watch the colorful crowd.||July 22, 2017
842kwank||40||If you love cooking, this is a place you must go. All sorts of seasoning, vinegar sauce, cheese, fresh vegetables, fruits, seafood ..... and you can try almost all of them before you decided to buy which, what, how many. Also many attrative food stalls, lots of choices, and in particular, if you love fresh oysters, then you have to try, relatively cheap with less than a sterling each for a 'normal' one. You can try an oyster (depending on supply that day) of the size of two fists put together! See whether you have the 'luck' to see this during your visit! ||July 22, 2017
garym186534||50||Visited here after being at the Sky Garden on Fenchurch Street. Always a favourite. Bustling with great, friendly people! We stopped and had lunch at one of the many fabulous bars and soaked up the atmosphere. Lots to look at, enjoy and buy. A great place to spend a few hours in London. ||July 22, 2017
MillionMiler17||50||It is generally crowed, but well well worth the time to come and spend here. There is such a huge variety of food to eat while you go around the market or to take home. There are fresh baked goods \ vegetables \ pies and deserts. You name it, its here. All fresh and home made. You gain weight just looking :-) You want to eat and try everything. There are also some great stops to relax for drinks as well. One tip, if you see something, and you want it, buy it, with the volume of people going thru the market, things go quickly sometimes.||July 22, 2017
Palomino922||40||We had the Market in mind while we did the Southwark Bankside Walk. It was a Saturday. Not sure every day was this busy, but it was packed. There is such a variety of vendors ranging from food, desserts, vegetables, fruits, and products. You could spend the day here just wandering around. It really was a bit too crowded for us but we did enjoy the experience. We ended up getting a couple of shredded lamb wraps which were delicious. There is not a lot of sitting areas there to relax so we ended up sitting on the street curb. It was a fun experience.||July 21, 2017
slpgttx||30||We went to market on Friday midday and were a little disappointed that we couldn't find the vendor that had the cheese wheels under heat to make toasties and cheesy potatoes! This was the first thing that all reviews I had read mentioned as well as many YouTube videos showed it. We asked several other vendors and no one could direct us in the right direction. After we got over that....we had a decent toastie at another stall and bought some great sweets! Fun overall and I'm sure we didn't see half of what was there. We talked to one of the guys running a food stall for a bit and he was super friendly and interested in our trip. He gave us directions to our next location and was helpful!||July 21, 2017
sarahjbear||50||Wow! So much food! A must-see for London! It can be overwhelming for a small town girl but it's definitely worth the crowds. ||July 21, 2017
pjaye2013||50||Great variety of fruit and veg and all manner of meat and poultry. Some unusual, some not so, but this market has to be one of the best and with plenty of places locally to eat and rink and sit and watch, it's free entertainment.By sharing your experiences, you're helping travellers make better choices and plan their dream trips. Thank you!||July 21, 2017
GeoffAUS1||40||After having visited the exorbitantly priced London Shard we wandered over to the nearby Borough Market for lunch. I had really only come to hear of them after the terrible terrorist attack but what a delightful surprise. They were buzzing with the local lunchtime patrons and some tourists and everyone was enjoying great produce with a range of good British food from pies and oysters to strawberries as well as other wonderful European fare. It was a fantastic hour or so and if you are down that way it is certainly worth a visit.||July 20, 2017
Shaun T||50||i love this place it has everything you want food wise not just the market stalls but the various street food guys selling anything from Indian tho Ethiopian cuisine it is truly amazing||July 20, 2017
17KAG||50||On a big walk on a Saturday, we stopped in here 3 times, once in the morning to explore, next for a quick lunch and last for a good sit down fish supper. The variety and quality of the wares offered by the vendors still amazes us. Our Indian lunch in a box and our pricier sit down fish and chip supper were both delicious. Also managed, not to mention the hand crafted donuts we finished off our lunch with. We also managed to score some food hostess gifts here, as well. A good people watching place and a chance to see local life on the weekend.||July 20, 2017
Linday20152015||40||We ended up at the borough market at the end of a walking tour. There were so many vendors with mostly food stuffs. (Cheeses, meats, cold foods, cooked, fruits). We wish we knew about this place before then we could've planned to spend more time here. This is a must see. Not a lot of places to sit or rest, just a few benches.||July 19, 2017
Dave R||50||As we were spending sometime in London, we decided to pay a visit to the Borough Market. As usual , this place is always busy, buzzing with visitors, traders, restaurateurs. The aroma arising from different food stalls is simply delicious. We decided to have a meal at Brood. We shared the meat meze for two was very tasty with more meat than we could consume. The variety of grilled meat, salad, homous was reasonable for the price charged. The beer and soft drinks were good. As always, a great place to be and taste the different cuisine.||July 19, 2017
Kat V||50||This Market is one in a million. It is definitely on the more ritzy side for a market, but it's full of lovely, delicious, options! There are dozens of baked good options, food options, and fresh fruits and veggies available. The truffle oil that's available at one of the carts was incredible! There are flower options all over that make for incredible gift ideas. The meats available always looked fresh and well-kept. This was one of my favorite markets in London for finding high-end products with a more "posh vibe".||July 18, 2017
Kitty8704||50||Yummy food everywhere. Reasonably priced as well as it is essentially take away/ informal dining. I tried oysters and I really enjoyed this market. Go for sure! ||July 18, 2017
Mike B||50||We didn't discover Borough Market until our 4th day in London, and we immediately wished we visited earlier. It is heaven if you like cheese, meats, fruits, bread, vegetables, beer/wine, and much more. You can sample almost anything you want and there are also vendors cooking up fresh food to eat right there. We ended going back a few more times before our trip was over. A definite place to visit...you will not be disappointed!||July 18, 2017
Fun2Travel_7||50||This is fun with all of the taste sensations available.Visually it is very appealing as it is and then you can buy as many different foods as you like and go home with a feast to be had. Even gluten free is catered for. ||July 18, 2017
Jegregg||50||Fantastic variety of street food, fruit, patesseries, cheese, bars. You name it, it's got it. Could have spent all day here. If you just prefer burgers then Maria's Cafe is the place to be, an amazing assortment of the most delicious burgers and hot dogs etc. Mouthwatering! Such good value too. Good job I was just visiting otherwise I'd be the size of a house. ||July 18, 2017
HampshireSally||50||So pleased to have finally got to visit Borough Market!! Amazing atmosphere, a dizzying amount of food stalls of every variety imaginable! A definite must for a visit to London!||July 18, 2017
tychieng||50||A great place to get fresh food - you really could visit daily. Vendors of all kinds - meats, seafood, fruits and vegetables, cooked food stands, sauces and condiments. We stopped by a place for scallops - so tasty. They had fresh, live uni (sea urchin) that they could cut open for you. Also tried Applebee's fish - got a cajun fish and garlic shrimp wrap that was so delicious I didn't want to share. I would go back every day if I had discovered it earlier on my trip.||July 18, 2017

Mashhoor A||50||If you are a foodie, this would be heaven! The place is amazing. there is a great variety of shops to get speciality products in all shapes and forms and taste amazing bites both sweet and savory. Let us start with fresh produce amazing variety of produce including amaZing mushrooms of all kinds. Cheeses, olive oils, vinegars, mustards, spices, and truffles. You will find speciality shops just revolving around these products. Seafood and fresh meats including exotic meats like camel, kangaroo, crocodile are also found there. Still the most eye catching was the fresh seafood especially the fresh oysters. We tried some and i can tell you they were one of the best i have ever tried in my life and definitely came off a boat few hours before we had them. Cooked foods, you can go around and keep trying all sorts of ready to eat foods and you will be more than stuffed just tasting and they serve it all pastas, paella, curries, koshari, raclette, falafel, burgers, fish and chips... etc. you name it and they have it. I took my 8 years old daughter to see all new things and try different foods and she loved it. ||July 17, 2017
1RG1JG||50||One of our favorite places we found in London. If you like to try all types of foods in one area this is for you. Pleasant surprises around every corner. Not enough time or stomach space to try everything. Favorite was the Furness Food Hut. We had the Wild Highland Venison Burger. It was so good!!. Make sure you have lots of time to find all the food stalls.||July 17, 2017
cleo30||50||This small food & farmers market is worth a quick visit just for the most delish pulled pork. Go straight for Hash- it on the corner- and you will not regret it. There are some lovely baked goodies, cheeses and specialty coffee as well. Its super easy to get to by Tube- just alight at London Bridge- exit the station and there it is!Its a must do for us everytime we are in London!||July 17, 2017
TravelFan40||50||While it can be overwhelming specially on a weekend this place is simply bliss for foodies. Everything that you pretty much crave for, there will be a offering and they hardly miss! So with five of us, we chose different cuisines so we can taste and rank, verdict: they are all pretty damn good!!! The duck salad is perfect until the last bite (duck confit can get tiring at one point), but it's perfectly balanced with mixed greens and apple sauce. Pulled pork (which is soooo in right now) also made a strong presence, the truffled raviolis, to die for - the Asian Wok noodles made me feel I was in Singapore - you can have a taste of the world in here and lack of nothing - hence we came back on a less busier weekday, and we found the experience as exhilarating and satisfying as the first time. Oh, and we couldn't help but buy some to take home (as in a different country home) with us: Spanish charcuterie, cheeses, tartuffata.... So don't you dare miss this!||July 17, 2017
takewee||50||Plenty of great food at reasonable price. Tried the lamb box with rice and roast hog ! Great !! Not many tables around though Take tube to London bride station. Turn Left up the slope and Turn Left before crossing the road||July 17, 2017
latitude44||50||amazing, sprawling food market with an infinite number of food options, we spent an hour just looking at all the food, so fun, then we had lunch from several of the dining options, all the food was good and the atmosphere was super. be sure to check out the cheese shop at Neal's Yard Dairy, they are so friendly and will let you sample any cheese you'd like.||July 16, 2017
meahtravels||40||Visited on a Friday so understandably it was very busy. There's a huge selection of food including burgers, oysters, hotdogs, pad Thai and lots more! Each stall is different so there is something to satisfy everyone! ||July 16, 2017
Michael3230704||50||This is one of my favourite parts of the city. It has such a relaxed vibe despite the market hustle and bustle. Great to wander around eating the different foods; this time we managed Paella, Pad Thai and coconut pancakes. We even had a glass of champagne (£6) in a plastic flute whilst we wandered about. Love it. As tourists we couldn't take advantage but - at the end of the day the traders sell off the fresh produce cheap. If I hadn't been staying in a hotel I'd have snapped up the fancy looking sausages at less than half price!! ||July 16, 2017
allaboutcricket||50||Full of history, set under the arches, fruit, veg, cheese, chocolate you name it they have it. Mulled wine in the winter is very warming.It has a real feel good factor about it. It's very London, right next to the Shard, and is a must visit place.||July 16, 2017
YosraKamel||50||A great place to go hunting for new flavors or snacks and pastries. We had some foccasia from the vendors at the entrance and they were too good to be true, then we had the venison burgers from the Furness Food Hut and we tried their calamari as well, DELICIOUS. The owners are super sweet, offering free samples to everyone. Then we finished off with some fresh juice from the "Turnips" stand and we found a small corner that sells yummy Turkish coffee, if you like strong coffee you'll love it. Make sure you stop by here it's just lovely.||July 16, 2017
SimplyFred||50||There's plenty of interesting and tasty food to be had here - especially good for finding lunch. The porchetta or hog roast is particularly tasty. Just have to find it!||July 16, 2017
Dencroft||50||Dropped through on Saturday afternoon, wonderful atmosphere and absolutely packed with people.Complete heaven for foodies... every type of food you can think of, fresh fish and vegetables a must!Lovely part of London on Bankside.||July 16, 2017
A-Bee-C||50||Visited Borough Market as we had a lunch booked at a restaurant here. Arrived early so wandered the market for a while before lunch and then again after lunch. The variety of goods on offer was just amazing - all fresh and delicious and beautifully displayed. The buzz in the place is invigorating. So many choices of things to eat and drink that everyone will find something that suits their taste.||July 16, 2017
Turtle5954||50||Feast your eyes on foods from everywhere....foods to buy and take home, foods to buy and consume...Venison burgers to die for....lovely lovely place and totally wonderful the hole area so busy with people so soon after the recent terror attack. Well done people!I will be back||July 16, 2017
Helen W||50||I've been many times and thoroughly enjoy the diversity the market offers so it was great to take someone who hadn't been before and see it afresh through new eyes. Not usually open on a Sunday, we were lucky enough to go when the Bastille celebrations were underway. Great food, great atmosphere and great people - what's not to love; go Borough!||July 16, 2017
SmilerP||50||What a wonderful place, busy, lively and what a fantastic atmosphere. The street food is wonderful. We could have stayed here all day just eating from the different stalls. Really enjoyed it here/||July 15, 2017
pags-21||50||The first time we stayed in this area was back in 2005 - absolutely love the area!So we keep going back.The market is only open from mid week on but is well worth the visit no matter where your staying in london - it is a must see. The area itself too with the Southwark Cathedral, The Globe Theatre, Tower Bridge, The Clink, The Tate....the walk along the Thames in this area is truly memorable!||July 15, 2017
olivia823||50||There are so many different food and drink stalls here at Borough Market it is amazing! The smells from all the foods is just great! One of us had Ethiopian cuisine, another a vegan burger and two of us noddles and all were reasonable priced and nice, noodles were slightly bland though. There are other stalls selling things besides food also. Just a note that majority of the stalls only take cash not cards. Obviously being a popular place it is very busy but has a good atmosphere and gets slightly less busier after the lunch time rush! Would defiantly visit again! ||July 15, 2017
KarenP506||40||What a hidden gem. Lots of great stalls and friendly traders bought some items for an impromptu picnic on the riverbank. Amazing bread cheese and meats ||July 15, 2017
Nicole F||50||We had heard that going in the morning was a way to avoid the crowds. This is true, although I'd recommend late morning so you get to try the lunch-type foods. Walking around and seeing the different food vendors is fun, and there are loads of samples to try. There are many different types of food and we tried everything from scotch eggs to savory pies to fresh fruit juices. We bought some treats to take back to our offices, too.||July 15, 2017
Thead1st||40||With a diverse set of food stands one can both eat they're way through and have meals for the week Live the cheese stands and the organic fruits and veggies and remember to find the Truffle Stand and taste the Truffle Honey. We go back every time we visit as well as the surrounding dock areas with great bar and restaurant options. ||July 15, 2017
renetab2015||50||We had great time here. It was very busy and crowded but the walk through the stands and little shops was awesome. You can find traditional Turkish tea and coffee. And of course Turkish delight in so many flavours. Great place to visit. I would not recommend however to use the toilets here.||July 15, 2017
dakotakennedy||50||I've always had a passion for local shopping and farmers markets, and this was absolutely amazing for me. So many vendors with amazing products, everyone was so lovely and it has a very beautiful welcoming feel to it. The grounds were very well maintained, and there was many rest spots for those who needed them. ||July 14, 2017
sandraf516||40||When in London a must see place is Borough Market. The stall holders are full of information on their products and there is a buzz about the whole area.||July 13, 2017
omundy1489||50||Wide selection of hot food to choose from - from German to Thai. The hot food is good value and was delicious. Didn't purchase anything from the farmers market but saw the prices of the cheese and it looked very pricey!!! The service was friendly. A downside was that there wasn't really anywhere to sit whilst eating. Will definitely be revisiting in the future!!||July 13, 2017
AJVaughnDOTcom||50||This is one of my favorite places in London. It's the first place I go to when I get to London. I just have to try everything. Even the odd stuff.I could spend all day here.If your willing you should make a few trips and have a meal at each of the unique little eateries.If I had my way we would transplant it to Arizona like they did the London Bridge.Try and get as much stuff as you can to ring home.As a heads up, you can't bring meats back to the USA and other countries, so check your countries requirements before buying them to bring home.||July 12, 2017
RichieMadano||50||Borough market is simply fantastic. You can get produce from all over the world as well as stuff from the UK and even local sourced products. I am lucky to live locally so I buy most of my fruit, veg and meat here every week. It's amazingly popular at lunchtimes with a wide variety of things on offer from sausage rolls and pork pies to curries, loads of different types of burgers, various world cusines and if you fancy splashing out, Oysters and Champagne. It's got pretty much everything. And to finish off, some amazing cakes! There's an amazing beer stall and if you need a sit down, there are lots of good pubs in the area or you can have the best fry-up in the known universe from Maria's cafe!The only downside is that it can get very crowded, especially around lunchtime on Fridays and weekends. Still, it's worth the crush to get a great salt beef sandwich!||July 12, 2017
Joanne C||50||have been reading about Borough Market for the longest time; and it lived up to all the expectations. Note that its not cheap, but it is homegrown, handmade and made from scratch! So worth it!||July 11, 2017
Yapwl||50||Must visit, plan to eat at least one meal here. I visited on a Monday 1pm where some stalls are closed. Still it was pretty jam packed with people. I could not imagine how crowded it will be on weekends.||July 11, 2017
Mel P||50||Brilliant experience and it was our first time in this particular part of London. To walk round the market and smell the different foods on offer was incredible....will definitely visit again when in the area, just for the food experience!||July 11, 2017
190748JoF||50||What a fantastic place, superb atmosphere- lots of great stalls and loads of choice for somewhere to grab a bite to eat or drink. This will definitely be on our list to visit from now on every time we visit London ||July 11, 2017
Tracy S||40||Loved the market ! had snacks all morning walking around seeing the different vendors It is must to do amazing would do it again||July 11, 2017
574graciee||40||Lovely atmosphere and fantastic stalls good for shopping and meals! I found a lovely vegan and gluten free friendly Indian food which was delicious. There is also a lovely French stall which sells cheesy boiled potatoes with green beans. There are a few good stalls for vegan gf people!!||July 11, 2017
283philb||50||We stayed close to here recently in a weekend trip to London What an awesome place all kinds of good veg fruit breads cheeses and all to be sampledEvery city should have one||July 11, 2017
Snorgent||50||Fantastic choice of freshly cooked cuisines from all over the world Great opportunity to try out tastes that you wouldn't order in restaurants Highly recommended ||July 11, 2017
jaketcunningham||50||Borough Market is a great place for food, drinks and gifts. There is everything from freshly made burgers, pizzas, cheese stands, fruit and veg, beers and wines and little treats. I would recommend going to greedy goats ice cream stand and get the salted caramel it's delicious.||July 11, 2017
Alison S||50||One of the highlights of our latest trips to London was our stop to the Borough Market. We wanted to do something neither of us had done in London before and so we walked over for lunch had I am so glad we did. The food was fantastic, if the grilled cheese stand is open I highly suggest that. We spent the next hour walking around different stalls tasting different cheeses, chocolates, fruits, etc, and purchasing our favorites. Interesting way to spend a few hours, lots to see and taste.||July 10, 2017
BNissen||40||The bad thing about this place, is that, it took so long, to decide which food stand we should chose. Because there was alot of interesting stands ||July 10, 2017
obleak1||50||I have visited Borough Market many times and was very happy to return when they re-opened in June. There is just SO MUCH FOOD here! I've shopped for cooking at home, as well as getting things to takeaway. You can also get food here and take it into the Rake bar (on the premises) to eat and have a few beers. An unbelievable variety of meats, seafood, fish, cheeses, olive oils, beer and wine and prepared foods await you.||July 10, 2017
410arthurf||50||Great discovery! Smells varied and pleasant, a great atmosphere and a perfect place to eat something.Very typical; A place not to be missed !!! Ideal for a walk on the south side of the thames.We loved it.||July 10, 2017
Carolynchase13||50||Had to go here to enjoy walking around and explore the market. So many different foods to try. Had the best pie and mash!! ||July 10, 2017
rat123||40||its is back to normal but my first time .Found it dark and depressing to look at .The produce is good great choice but far to expensive then X normal market more of a tourist or food expect||July 10, 2017
sueg197||50||Great to be back in London for a weekend break and to visit the lovely Borough Market again. First visit since the horrendous attack and how lovely it was to see the place so busy. Fabulous food stalls for a spot of lunch and also some treats to take home. The traders are so friendly and helpful and it really is foodie heaven. Love, love, love Borough Market!!||July 9, 2017
Curtis W||50||An amazing variety of food for snacks or meals, whatever is desired. We lived close by so would use the market for breakfast supplies including fresh cheese, eggs and bread and it made eating very affordable. There are also a ton of options for snacks at the market including fresh juice, ice cream, baked goods etc. The market is beautifully laid out and has something for everyone. Definitely worth checking out more than once. Note - it is closed Sunday's which caught us off guard, luckily we had already visited multiple times.||July 9, 2017
EcosseClaire||50||We have always loved Borough Market and after everything the area has been through recently, were so happy to return today and enjoy the Bastille festivities. Great fun and lots of laughs. The people are lovely, the shops/stalls are of such high quality and the atmosphere is unique. Carry on what you're doing Borough-because you're doing alright. Be back again soon!||July 9, 2017
musicalroad||50||As predicted the busy Borough Market near London Bridge is a mecca for consumer to producer food, meat, fish, bakery CHEESE and lots of prepared foods too. Go for lunch or meet the cheesemaker and sausagemakers, sample and bring home for an amazing treat. After the tragedy summer of 2017 it is back open, bustling with locals and tourists, and feels very safe and welcoming. Go supoort these vendors and treat yourself!||July 9, 2017
ColesK||50||We have been meaning to come here for sometime & it disappoint, there is so much to see, buy & eat. We were just sorry we had booked a table elsewhere as we would have eaten from one of the stalls. It's great to see some of the old London traditions being kept live. ||July 9, 2017
Ty1607||50||Lovely market to walk around with really nice products and shops. A large choice of fresh food and lots to eat ||July 9, 2017
hongxu7||40||By now, everyone are aware of Borough market which is probably the reason why this place is always packed on Saturdays when tourists (which are in majority) swarm the market. Still you will probably have great time here, walking around stalls which serve a great variety of tasty food while having fresh produces all around you. My best tip: buy yourself a bottle of prosecco and walk around the food stalls, tasting the best of what Borough market has to offer!||July 9, 2017
Woodside8437||50||We visited soon after the market had re-opened following the earlier horrible tragedy and found it slightly quiet and sombre as one might expect. However, this had little effect on the absolute Aladdin's cave display of food, right across the range.It may be unkind to mention favourites but here goes (all at the back of the market): a wonderful fruit stall where my wife bought two magnificent peaches, a craft beer stand with a gentleman who knew much about beer and much about how to please customers, and Shellseekers Fish and Game where I found incredibly tasty game faggots.Also to merit comment is a gourmet coffee shop, just across the road. Iced coffee was needed on this very hot day, and a memorable dring was forthcoming.||July 9, 2017
MrMrsHappyR||50||Wow a truly fantastic selection of delicious foods and drinks from all over the world. Great for breakfast, lunch, or buy a selection of stuff for a picnic or to take back to hotel. Our favourite was the fantastic breakfast at Maria's Market Cafe.||July 8, 2017
bambeena||50||My Husband is a foodie but he's extremely picky when it comes to how much he enjoys a meal, there is always a but.I've been to Borough Market on my own before so i suggested that to him and he showered me with questions, is it far , is it crowded , is it a must see .... at the end i managed to convince him and we went there. He had the time of his life walking around those food stands and admiring the menus and how the food was cooked. We spent some good 2.5 hours there and we had the best Sangria's, amazing burger and some traditional Egyptian Koshari (unfortunately don't recall the name of the shops)||July 7, 2017
Mary T||50||I had the best grilled cheese of my life from a cheese shop here. It changed me, I'm different now. Tons of variety in shops and very wallet friendly!||July 7, 2017
Suzy K||50||This is a great place to stop for lunch. You can find food from all over the world. We thoroughly enjoyed walking the market and trying different things. ||July 7, 2017
hollyr453||50||We enjoyed the people ; and the food and the souvenirs. Close to where we were staying as well. Great chocolates||July 7, 2017
HumphLK||50||What a gem! Street food and vendors offering anything you could think of in the center of London! Weekends are super busy, but not every vendor is opened on weekdays, so choose wisely! ||July 7, 2017
thebenshawspopman||50||We did not realise that Borough Market was a food market and stumbled upon it just after tucking Into a pub lunch of pie and mash. ..This couldn't stop us from sampling some of the amazing "street style" foods on offer though! Great quality organic and locally sourced produce and the food stalls happily displayed food hygiene scores too in most lot of cases. Our visit to the market was for me the highlight of the weekend, a brilliant east end market with all the hustle and bustle. You really should go....But go there hungry! :-)||July 6, 2017
theforces||50||We stumbled onto the Burrough Market and it is a must see. Great food and vendors and not touristy and stuffy like Leadenhall Market which you can quickly visit for the "Harry Potter Novelty". I wish we would have waited to eat lunch at one of the many great food options at the Burrough Market. Also grab a cold drink at the Globe Tavern on Bedale St. Great little pub!||July 6, 2017
KrishanRodrigo||50||This place is buzzing around lunch time when i visited. Came across it by accident going to the cathedral next to it and stopped to have some fabulous ethiopean rice and curry. You know the food is great when the queue wraps around the stall! Has also other great food options including sweets and coffees so why not pop in if you are around. ||July 6, 2017
Scottygirl82||40||Borough Market is a great place for anyone wanting to buy and eat the freshest of food. The fish stalls are a favourite with individual servings of jellied eels, prawns, cockles etc available to eat so fresco. The fresh oysters washed down with a glass of prosecco were delicious and another recommendation.Whatever you want - fresh bread, cheese, oils, fruit and veg, fish, meat, pie and mash, noodles it's all there.Borough Market should be on everyone's list to visit. ||July 6, 2017
Juan D||50||We just happen to come across this place and we are so glad we did. It's a huge outdoor multi-vendor area offering lots of different kinds of foods and goods. If you are in the area it is well worth the visit. You should schedule your visit to coincide with lunch and figure spending a couple of hours there just checking out the shops etc. The only negative is there's no place to sit and eat, so you'll either eat standing or try to find a nook somewhere.||July 6, 2017
Norwaybound2012||50||We just LOVED Borough Market! Highly recommend for any foodie or anyone looking for a unique experience. We headed over after a Thursday morning tour of Shakespeare Globe Theatre - easy walk. We came hungry thankfully. First we browsed all and sampled wherever possible (many vendors have samples out). We opted for a sausage roll that was beyond incredible. We let our teens venture around while adults enjoyed a pint at the pub on the street. We also enjoyed donuts from Bread Ahead. We loved the market so much that we added to our next day too!||July 6, 2017
u4313464||40||We enjoyed a juice and toastie here. Heaps of food vendors with a wide range of fruit, veggies and take away meals. Great place for lunch or breakfast. Not too busy.||July 6, 2017
bnettmd||50||What a fun market! Food for just about anyone and all relatively reasonably priced! I highly recommend sampling a bit from as many vendors as you can - make sure you check when the full market is open as it is 1000% better when all vendors are present!||July 6, 2017
Vera R||50||Our first trip to London, my son took us to Borough Markets. I loved it. There was so much food variety to choose from and also hand made treats as well. Definitely worth visiting.||July 6, 2017
JAXYScotland||50||such a diverse range of food, people. well worth a visit. I wanted to try everything, ended up with a Malaysian curry in a box - delicious. Bars around were busy with music and such a party atmosphere.||July 5, 2017
samanthajfindlay||50||This was our favorite of all the markets in London. There was so much going on, so much life and vibrancy. There was so many food choices, that you could eat anything that you wanted. I got the best donut from a stall, and I am still thinking about it.||July 5, 2017
GlennS9000||50||If you‘re hungry, pop in at the generous Borough Market!Variety of food from all over the world, was served kind and friendly everywhere, even the longest queue was only with a short waiting time, its simply a MUST if you‘re in London!||July 5, 2017
JEH64||50||The variety of food and drink is astounding. Yes it is a little pricey but it is good quality. I tried a Boston Sausage bap for breakfast - very healthy! Very tasty. Then an iced coffee to follow. It is worth a visit even if you don't eat because there is a lot to look at and it us convenient for the Globe, Tate modern, Bankside gallery.||July 5, 2017
colgojetter||50||Visited this on a saturday, midday so expected it to be rammed and it was. I didn't actually buy anything from any of the stalls but had a look at most stalls and was really interesting to see different cultures cuisines. Some good pubs in the area too. Lovely little market.||July 5, 2017
HenkPeels||40||Both foodwise and people wise this place is oozing culture. So many different nationalities, so many quisines to try. Big meats but also plenty of vegetarian options. I enjoyed both the meals I had here over the last 2 days. I visited on a sunny Tuesdsy/Wednesday in July around 14:00 and it was still busy. Some call it a tourist trap, maybe it is, so the prices might be too high? ( 7£ for pulled lamb wrap) but it is definitely worth a strawl through. For me the one minus is that there are next to none places to sit to eat your meal. ||July 5, 2017
bunkaleebee||40||Initially a little apprehensive about heading to the Borough markets due to the recent situations however it is a must see (on an empty stomach) lots of food variety and great atmosphere ||July 4, 2017
MrGaucho1987||50||This place is a must visit. We dropped in on a rainy Saturday. Still packed. The market was wall-to-wall by 10 a.m. So get there early. You’ll marvel at the variety of British food favorites. Come hungry and try a variety of foods. We did a sandwich at Hobbs and loved it. The pathways are tight and the terrain a bit uneven, so plan ahead if you have walking issues. Then use the market as your kick-off point to visit the Globe Theater, Tate Modern, St. Paul's and beyond. Bring your walking shoes and embrace London.||July 4, 2017
TravellerFromNWales||50||Borough market is a place we always make a point of going to when we're in London. We particularly wanted to call by this time to show our support in the wake of the recent terrorist attack.The market has changed considerably over the years and many parts have been modernised. Seeing such a wide variety of high quality food and drink all in one place is truly amazing. We felt that it's now lost some of its charm and character as a modern, more trendy element is up and coming. However, this needs probably needs to happen for the market to continue being a success rather than lose this great historic foodie heaven. Be warned that the market can get very busy as it is a massive draw for tourists who want to grab a bite to eat and take lots of arty photographs of everything from vegetables to cheese. All this said, we still love Borough and always visit, try and buy from here when in London.Look out for the lady freshly squeezing orange juice, although pricey at £2.50, it's worth it and tastes better than the ones which have already been poured into plastic cups.||July 4, 2017
HimanshuB381||50||If you like food then this is the place to visit. Tip-always go in hungry & ideally for a brunch. You will get in lots of varieties of food so be prepared to eat different cuisines & have small portions. Nowadays the places gets very crowded during lunch hours & on Saturdays so plan accordingly. Also most of the stalls are take away food counters & very few places are meant to sit in & eat.But trust me you won't regret going & savouring the food.||July 4, 2017
Dianne M||40||Fab,fab,fab,fab,FAB! The best produce ever. Best marketeers ever .Get down there and enjoy a bite,drink and artisanal products .They need your support -recent events mean they lost 11 days trade .You won't be sorry .Can even get Prosecco to 'go' .Ace .||July 4, 2017
bulletdozer||40||This market was always popular with tourists but seems even busier now following the recent terrorist attack. There are more stalls than ever but food is sold at tourist prices, never cheap. It is in prime location to grab customers as they start the Bankside walk from around Southwark Cathedral towards The Globe Theatre, Millenium Bridge and Tate Modern. A good day out.||July 3, 2017
suwenl2016||50||I just visit this amazing market with my family. The market is exist for ages. Do unique. Acctually this is a food market. So many food go taste from classic pork belly, salted beef, seafood.. including pastries and juices..A large type of cheese, tea..But there us not enough seats for enjoy the food.||July 3, 2017
dbre2016||50||April 2017. Wow! really enjoyed this. Every kind of food available. the crowds were not too bad but there were some small queues around lunchtime. Found some interesting shops in the side streets. By just wandering around we came across a pub on the river side which was very busy but a great place for an hour or so. From the Market it is an easy walk to The Shard, and the Bridge across the Thames. ||July 3, 2017
sammatt1||50||Vibrant..all tastes catered for..so many options..from sweet..to savoury..cakes to coffee...honey to ham...all the stalls seem to be staffed by friendly happy people..||July 3, 2017
J9242NIdavew||40||This busy bustling market situated under a bridge is vibrate place to visit for a range of locally produced food. Prices are as you'd expect, but not unreasonable.Accessibility is ok for wheelchairs and pushchairs, however bottlenecked crowds may mean a slow steady approach is required to move through the market.||July 3, 2017
WWTraveller26||50||This is a great place for anybody who is fond of food. There's artisanal cheese, boar burgers, fresh sea food, and every imaginable cuisine of great quality. You can buy a drink and grab a table at one of the restaurants or grab one of the free but busy tables outside. Don't miss it. ||July 3, 2017

If you can't find something here that you want to eat you're going to starve!!!Well worth a visit even if you're not hungry as you'll always buy something to take home for later from here without fail.Fascinating architectural place which screams old London at its best!!!||July 2, 2017
Jamie O||50||I love eating here and my favourite was always king prawn egg noodles however the price has risen from £6.50 to £8. Far to expensive. It also used to be cooked fresh but it's now scooped out of a bucket and warmed up. Nasty. There are lots of other cheaper food places there and a good tip is Hot Munchies in Southwark Street. Sit in and eat cheaply. Give Borough market a try as it's a great atmosphere with lots of food choices. ||July 2, 2017
IvyFlood||50||We hadn’t planned to visit this market at all on our recent trip to London but I decided we should at the last minute and I’m shocked at what we could have missed out on! Absolutely fantastic market!Great variety of food and drink on offer – all Instagram worthy! I had a famous cheese toastie from Kappacasein and it was divine. I could have quite happily eaten another one. I also had a lovely ice cream from The Greedy Goat. We also bought a cheese and olve stick from Bread Ahead which had some lovely looking doughnuts!Besides from what there is of offer, the surroundings and architecture are also beautiful and interesting too.My only regret is not eating enough food. It was about 4pm when we visited on a Friday afternoon and so this was a very late lunch for us. We had a meal booked later that evening at 8pm and I didn’t want to feel too full for it. We didn’t even end up going for the meal because we weren’t hungry enough/too tired! So I wished I’d tried more things in the market! My advice would be don’t plan on eating any other meals that day – just fill yourself up at the market.I’d love to go back!||July 2, 2017
MarkF573||40||Traders are friendly and willing to offer their expertise. The variety of what can be bought here is amazing. Prices are higher than most places however. Great experience for foodies or just to experiment with things you haven't tried.||July 2, 2017
28hannah2017||50||Lots of stalls selling wonderful foodfrom many parts of the world. One can eat on the hoof very deliciously as well as gaze as everything on offer. Also a marvellous flower stall.||July 1, 2017
KimAv2014||50||What an amazing place, a huge variety of fantastic foods, there really is something for everyone. Its a must see market where you can spend the whole day soaking up the atmosphere and sampling great food & drink.||July 1, 2017
315marys||50||An absolute must to see and sample the culinary best that London has to offer! There is everything that a gourmet must include in a visit, and everything that someone who just wants to browse and experience a true open air market. It is only a 20 minute walk from the Tower Bridge, and worth the walk. (also accessible by the Underground)||July 1, 2017
ysafood||30||Borough Market has been a must-go in London due to the numerous food stalls selling everything from seafood to spices and condiments. I particularly recommend the cheese and a coffee shop called the Monmouth. The vibe here was great too but the food was a bit overpriced, just like any other places to eat in London tbh.I'd say it's worth to visit as a group so you can share a greater variety of food with your friends and split the bill!||July 1, 2017
Grigeli||50||You have to eat the fish&chips here, it's really delicious. The market itself is full of good food and I always buy my spices here ... really a nice and special place to visit.||July 1, 2017
Otto120||40||The London Borough market is located crossing the London bridge southwards, very close to the Tube station The London Bridge. It is a jolly, buzzing place full of people and tourists, offering different kind of things from wine, sea food, cheeses, flowers, etc, etc.One can buy finished or semi-finished products there, as well as have something to eat and drink in the numerous pubs and cafes. Right across the market there is a famous Monmouth Coffee shop, which offer enormous choice of coffee types and is worth visiting. A Live part of the great city!||July 1, 2017
coreyd179||50||I'm a huge fan of hand made, small batch, artisanal everything. If you are as well, you will love this market. Beyond the selection of shops, there's something about how this space is nestled between the cathedral, the bridge, and the old warehouses. It's so charming. Definitely worth a visit.||June 30, 2017
drsim001||50||Review by Dr Sim. Worth a visit by tourist. Visited Borough Market on the second day of opening after the terrorist attack. Enjoyed the walk, smelling the smells, and eating different types of food. Rgds Dr Sim||June 30, 2017
Invertebrada||40||We arrived there about 5:30 PM with a walking tour and the market was already closed. Ithough it was a market similar to camden, with different products and food but is really a food and veggie market, where you can find fish, meats etc, sonaturally they close early.We did have drinks and spanish food in the alley near by and the vibe was great despite the resent events. ||June 30, 2017
nakiboys||50||It was great to see Borough Market bustling and incredibly busy. The market traders and restaurants certainly needed support after the recent terrorist strike in the area. It was a positive experience all round. Great food and incredible selection of street food stalls.||June 29, 2017
712sanaam||50||A feast for the pallet and for the eyes. Loved the vibe in this place. You can get anything you can think of and more. We bought great cheese and oysters. Loved it. ||June 29, 2017
G2496JRchrish||50||Yes, London has its pubs every 5 feet but to really find the soul of this city visit Borough Market.What was initially intended to be a short stroll around the market with a stop off for lunch turned out to be a 4 hour journey of culinary wonderment.It's hard not to stop at the first vendor you see and buy the wonderful spices, cheeses, baked goods and other offerings but hold off if you can and explore all there is to see. It's great. You can sample cheese. Get a refreshing Pimms drink. Munch on an Ostrich burger and finish it off with a baked goodie. Bring your appetite and your walking shoes!||June 29, 2017
Stevie D||50||I don't know how I could have lived in London my whole life and not known about Borough market. It's a must to visit and we will take London guests there in future. There's many stall of food - bread, vegetable, coffee, cheeses etc and many restaurants and stalls to buy food. It's great fun and I could have bought and bought and bought‼️||June 29, 2017
Sandy B||50||OMG, food...food...more food and sweets! If you can't find anything to eat here, just go home. My daughter had German bratwurst, my son had lamb and I had a huge cheese toasty. Then we had some amazing cheesecake, an apple fritter from a Russian baker and some of the best ice cream ever made from goats milk.Any kind of food you could want is here!We were here the 2nd day they opened after the attacks and there was a heavy polic presence but never felt unsafe.||June 28, 2017
AdamOngyerth||40||We came here after reading the reviews, and had never heard of it before then! Really nice places to eat and drink, and browsed at most of the stalls. Impressed with the variety of foods on offer here, and very different to high street shops. We will be visiting again in the future ||June 28, 2017
yogainasuitcase||50||One of my all time favs, been going here for years and it always has surprises, love the locals and the food is down right delicious, there is so much to choose from, a real taste of London. GO!!||June 28, 2017
sarahskwier||50||Walking through the Borough Market made me feel like I was Alice seeing Wonderland for the first time. There were so many different types of food from meats to cheeses to desserts. I purchases some bread with melted cheese and made myself ration it for a few days because it was so tasty. I'm sure you could eat there every day and always find something new. Definitely worth the trip over the bridge! ||June 28, 2017
whereskari||50||Accidentally stumbled upon this food market walking back to our hostel one afternoon, it was a very pleasant surprise! We wandered around all the different food stalls offering cuisine from around the world, from lunch to desserts to local honey. It was difficult to decide what to get but we ended up at a BBQ stand and ordered mac n cheese with pulled pork. Seriously excellent. The vibe of the place was very energetic as a market ought to be, and it was a great find on our last day.||June 28, 2017
nadia089||50||A fantastic place to spend time tasting and eating great food, the variety is enormous , there is something for everyone, you are really spoiled for choice. The atmosphere is vibrant and busy, the people who run the shops and stalls are all eager for you to taste their food and happy to tell you all about it.||June 27, 2017
AriEila||20||Look, I'm not going to put on my fedora and stare into the distance, but Borough Market has seen better days. I know I'm definitely not the first--I would have loved to have seen this place back when it was starting out, but I've only been hanging around it for a decade. When I first came to London in '06, Borough was already starting to transition towards foodhall madness but still had inexpensive produce, local/seasonal fare, and basically could call itself a farmer's market at a pinch. Small producers had small stalls, even tiny little tables under parts of the bridge that are now used for freight storage. For a student with a limited budget and a huge foodie love for the obscure, this was heaven.It wasn't very glamorous, but you could see where it was heading with large-ish and clearly well-funded big producers hawking their expensive wares. So you'd buy your reasonably priced leeks, some heirloom tomatoes, maybe some nice goat cheese, then taste some overpriced olive oil and call it a day.More importantly, you could actually walk through it without being trampled to death. What is Borough Market today? It's a place where tour buses offload hoards of people and you can forget buying anything at a reasonable price at any stall. Samples are still plentiful (if you're hungry, you can reasonably graze your way through the better part of a meal, but be ready to fight tooth and nail for a sample with about 200 schmucks who have the same idea as you) but now the market is fully on its next wave transition: from luxury goods to lunch meal market.I'm not trying to hate on this place. There are still good things to be had (notably some Russian pastries, fantastic cheese, hard-to-find produce and meat) but if it takes me 45min to fight my way to that one butcher that has the thing I want, and another 25min to escape, it ceases to be worth it. I'm sadly laying Borough Market to rest as a place where you can actually shop for food.As for the hot meals/lunch end of things, there are a couple places that are ok (Ethiopian, falafel) but the prices are mostly wince-y and you really, really have to be happy to be in a crush (think Tokyo metro at rush hour and yes, I've experienced this). I'm sure someone who lives closer by can tell you if there are 'off' times anymore, but be ready to be squished and jostled and overwhelmed, but not in a good way.||June 27, 2017
bmp87||50||The market is a great place full of food stalls selling worldwide food, it's a must visit in London. On the small side but well worth an hour of your time in London||June 27, 2017
Neil00||50||I've you're in London and you love fresh food, go here for lunch. An amazing choice of freshly cooked food from around the world and at very reasonable prices too. Then you can wander a few yards and eat overlooking the river. Brilliant. ||June 26, 2017
djh5723||50||Had reservation about visiting after recent terrorist attack, but can't live that way. Glad I went. Very interesting area with so many food, drink, spice and goods options. Really enjoyable||June 26, 2017
travelholicc||50||I had pulled pork from somewhere near the entrance beside a church and it was the best I ever had (can't be missed, the smell will just lead you there). Definitely a place not to be miss for foodies and hungry people out there.||June 26, 2017
ExplorerC21||50||Me and my partner recently visited London and decided a month or so ago that we would go and visit Borough Market, and even with the recent tragedies we decided to still go ahead to show our support and stand strong, and we are so pleased we did. The atmosphere was brilliant and there and so many different stalls to look around. We got tons of food whilst we were there and we couldn't recommend it more. If you are visiting London, Borough Market is a must.||June 26, 2017
giammarcof2014||50||If you to come in London and visit one of the most beautiful, strange, peculiar and uncommon places of this city, you have to come here. There is a lot of different people and type of food. You can drink or eat or buy whatever you want. It's magic. ||June 26, 2017
250sbt||50||If you love cheese, and oysters, this market is it! A wide variety of foods ranging from fresh seafood to cheeses of all types and Turkish delight to tantalize the palette.||June 25, 2017
Don B||40||A truly spectacular market with numerous stalls full of fresh produce. Also plenty of places to taste the produce as many stalls also offer cooked food as well. Make sure you visit Neil's Dairy just off the market for some fantastic cheeses. There are so many different styles of food on offer that one could eat their way round the world without leaving the confines of the market.||June 25, 2017
Kelbop||50||First visit for us and what a great market! We bought a Pimms to drink whilst shopping and tried the fresh ravioli, chicken shawarma and some amazing Italian sandwiches - so much to try and buy - left with many bags and a cheeky cider Best market I've been to in many many years ||June 25, 2017
tracy a||50||This is foodie heaven, my goodness full of the most wonderful foods and drinks. If you were not hungry when you got there you soon will be. The choice of things to buy is amazing, I wish this was on my doorstep.||June 25, 2017
W3908GWdavidr||50||This is now on my "must visit" recommendation list for London visitors.Even if you're not a "foodie" the people watching and sense of history wandering around is a fine way to pass a couple of hours. You can eat a lunch just by grazing on small dishes as you peruse the vendors. Had possibly the best Scotch Egg of my life followed by some exotic game meats off a stick from two of the food stands. Best spice stand in town.Plant of pubs on the periphery.Just a great time and very easy to get to via tube (London Bridge station on Jubilee & Northern lines). Just need to break that tourist "nothing to see south of the river except the Eye.." mindset. It was never true to begin with but build it into a south bank stroll including the nearby Tate Modern.||June 25, 2017
Cath1968||50||If you love food you'll love the market. Sooo many amazing stalls and the atmosphere is fantastic. Vast amounts of cheeses, meats, fruit/veg etc all displayed on great looking stalls. Outside and inside area has lots of stalls selling cooked food as well. Pubs nearby were overspilling with customers. A definate must to visit||June 25, 2017
HollyBrooke026||50||Visited here in late May on a Thursday afternoon. It was swarming with people at this time. However, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit, as we ate our way through the market. We had fresh squeezed juices, wonderful Mediterranean beef and salads, and decadent donuts. The choices and quality of food is just amazing. Although not cheap, I didn't feel that the items were outrageously expensive. The hardest part on a busy day is finding somewhere to eat your takeout. People stash themselves wherever they can find a spot. Many sit on the curb, on the sidewalks, etc... Would love to return to this place again and again. There is nothing like it.||June 24, 2017
jameselee2016||50||Went round the market as a Father's Day present. Went to several pubs and a lovely restaurant with Louise where had a lovely meal. The market was very busy and the various smells made my day. ||June 24, 2017
TrevorB||50||The first weekend after the market reopened and it was very busy. The atmosphere was amazing and upbeat. The vast food and drink choices throughout made it difficult to pick from but we took our time and both veggie and carnivore dined very well indeed.Prices are definitely not cheap and I couldn't afford to eat here everyday but as a treat it was top notch.Highly recommended.||June 24, 2017
alimN3123HM||50||I love this market, and after they were horrendously attacked I am so pleased to see everything back open, and the same friendly welcoming service. I particularly enjoy the cheese stands, but the liquorice stall is also worth a visit, but honestly all the stalls are great as are the staff.||June 24, 2017
N7952DTlisah||50||This market is in a great location and the choice of food and drinks are amazingFrom World beers to home made lemonade and the selection of food and fresh vegetables is also great I would recommend the roast to go it's perfect every time.||June 24, 2017
mike e||50||We have timed our vacation in mid May as usual, and as circumstances have unfolded, it seems it was timed perfectly to have avoided all of the attacks and troubles dear London has dealt with lately. Borough Market is the oldest and best one in town and we love it, and will always come here for the food , and the vendors, who are a delight to deal with. I have looked at other reviewers June pictures and I must say it seems a bit deserted here which is usually not the case. When we have been here, usually on a Friday and or Saturday, the place was always hopping with happy and hungry people just loving life and enjoying the experiences. I believe that it may be a bit too soon after the attack for it to be up to its normal levels of crowds, which saddens me. But I know, and certainly feel this wonderful market will bounce back fully in time. These great vendors, many I know by face and personality, having been many times, are going to perservere and get on with making Borough Market a must see place for foodies and fun. The place was so busy when we were there in May, you could hardly get great pictures, as tables were largely surrounded by so many hungry people, eager to eat whatever strikes their fancy. This is as it should be, and I will always remember it so. Go to support the vendors and do try the duck confit salad as it was fabulous. The cider man is always a welcome sight, and the Highland cattle burgers are my staples. Pie Minister is a must for savory pie lovers like us. The best days to go are Fridays and Saturdays, but it is open during the week as well, closed on Sundays.||June 24, 2017
Anise2014||40||Discovered this special place and was surprised at the activity. Flowers from recent tragedy on the sidewalk, by a wall. Otherwise no idea unless you spoke to people about the van. Good honey, many flavors like lavender, and cheese, flowers, meats. Lively place in town. ||June 23, 2017
Stephen B||50||Fantastic place. Lots of really nice stalls. Loads of choices to eat. A must visit place near London bridge station||June 23, 2017
Susan W||50||So happy that borough market is open once more. Love to visit it with all the wonderful smells of food. So much to eat and drink. Loads of fresh produce to buy it's a variable delight to the eyes. All senses are well catered for here. So happy it's back and busy.||June 23, 2017
Laura W||50||If you are on a trip to London you must visit this market for lunch. There are so many different food options that you can go with anyone, even the pickiest of eaters. The pastries stand serve amazing bread and pastries. There are also many cheese stands with fresh and delicious cheese. I ended up eating at Gourmet Goat. If you love goat or goat cheese this is the place for you. It is different than anything we have here in America, but so tasty. We also went on a Friday and at 12 they had a really cool cooking segment where they showed us how to make different meals, and we got to sample it.||June 22, 2017
HM543||50||There are several markets in London, but if you can only visit one and like food, this is the one to visit. I wanted to try everything. ||June 22, 2017
Athienitou||40||We decided to swing by Borough market after a visit to the London Bridge. After reading all the reviews I thought there would be lots of vendors but frankly they were not that many. Not sure if it was coz of the recent terrorist attack in the area. The post it's & flowers were a touching but grim reminder of what had happened there a short time ago. Anyway we wanted to support the market irrespective & there was a strong police presence. On we go...Lots of food choices - Indian, Ethiopian, Thai, lamb stand selling lamb cooked in various ways & lots of bakery stands. We went for the Boston Sausage first - Sausage on a stick & the Sausage roll. Sausages were ok but felt complete disinterest from the vendors. They just put a sausage on the skewer & told us to take a small sausage roll that was sitting in front of the cash register. I honestly thought those were samples & not items for sale. They were uncovered & sitting in the sun. Also no offer for napkins or ketchup or mustard. Just no interest at all. No wonder their booth was not busy. I would not go back there ever. We also tried the cheese pastry square at one of the vendors & that was good! Our son had the Mac & Cheese that was sold by vendors near the stairs that was delicious. They also seemed to have some really interesting cheese sandwiches that looked so decadent.We had 2 plates of Indian food that were really good. One was dosas filled with potato & topped with cilantro chutney/sauce & tamarind. Other dish was mixed vegetables & we got a side of fried vegetable balls which were good. For dessert I loved the almond Macaroon from the cinnamon tree bakery & my kids enjoyed a brownie. I also enjoyed a cup of coffee from a stall called Flat top. I was expecting to find bread stands & other places I'd read about. Not sure why there were less vendors but it was still an interesting outing & a good way to try different food. Wish food tables were more accessible as it is hard to walk around the market & eat at the same time!||June 22, 2017
eimimathetes||50||I visited Borough Market within days of its reopening after the recent attack, and I was thrilled to see the Market thriving once again. If you want street food from any of dozens of places around the world, go to Borough Market. If you want fresh food, or cooking lessons, or specialty items (like the best mustard selections on the planet), or a kitchen store, or . . . go to Borough Market. This place is an example of what life in London is like at its best. We were able to talk to a few vendors who experienced the recent turmoil, and we celebrated their resilience. The day after our visit, we returned for a second helping and were glad we did. In this uncertain world, we felt safe in Borough Market, and our presence was appreciated warmly by the vendors. On my next trip to London, I will be found in Borough Market.||June 21, 2017
BlackCoookie||50||So much to see, so much to taste. I wish I had more tummy space just to fit in more food. If you're a foodie or a homecook,, you will enjoy the variety here.||June 19, 2017
OhMyWestMidlands||40||If you look on the market website it's exactly as it says on the tin. However, except to eat standing up or sitting on the street as very few outlets have seating (this is a market) Expect £7.00 for a wrap, burger or dish of food minimum. Overall a fantastic array of independent food and sites. ||June 19, 2017
Serenalondonal||50||When the weather is good I really love going to Borough Market near the Thames river, I usually meet up with a friend for lunch, and then shop for fruits, vegetables, and fresh fish for the week. Its a chill place, the street shops accept credit cards thankfully, so many new things to taste and try for the first time, very enjoyable.||June 19, 2017
VMH0312||50||I've been a regular visitor to this market for a few years and loved every visit, there a warm community spirit as you walk through, the stall holders are friendly and happy to chat about their produce||June 19, 2017
Baker_Bowie||40||We loved walking around and tasting all the different produce on offer. The vendors were all friendly and happy to talk about what they do. A bit smaller than expected but it was nice not to be overwhelmed.||June 18, 2017
tigers81||50||My sister in law took us here on our first stop on a full day of her version of a London walking tour . We thoroughly enjoyed walking through the whole market . Spices , cheese , fish , meat , fresh cooked food - and best coffee in London ! We sampled from many vendors , each grabbed a small bite to eat from one of the many small carts serving a wide range of foods .. the sights , smells and ambiance were fantastic . I would visit often if in my neck of the woods .||June 18, 2017
JacktarLancsuk||40||Spent three to four hours wandering around the stalls. Some fabulous produce on display from what I could only call giant oysters to fantastic Japanese beef. Tried lots of French cheese's and charcuterie and actually bought some. Had some great fast food from the various outlets which were very tasty. Also had the misfortune to meet a display of the ' London Attitude ' as it was described by another stall holder. A lady had ordered a meal, and when she suggested that what was presented to her was not what she had ordered she was told by the guy running that stall that ' that is what you ordered so that is what you are getting' !. We pulled out of the queue and bought dhosa' s instead. That apart, the rest of the market was magical. I think we heard accents from all over the world. Well worth a visit but allow plenty of time to stroll around and make sure you take ypour credit card||June 18, 2017
KarenKew||40||A great selection of food stalls offering fresh treats - in a bustling and busy locale. After the terrorist attack the police presence was noticable but so good that people are going to support the traders. Great for lunch!||June 18, 2017
JerryH9905||40||May 9, 2017 - After walking along the Thames River, we decided to visit Borough's Market. It had been highly recommended. It didn't take us long to find a place with delicious pasta. Then we walked around the market looking at other choices plus deserts which included fruits, etc. This is a great market to find fresh produce.It was a nice break at Borough's Market. I highly recommend a visit. You cannot go away hungry for food or mixing with people.||June 17, 2017
neminskii||40||Borough Market was the first place I went to after I touched down in London. We went there for lunch and ate burgers, scotch eggs (very salty), oysters, baklava and sweet potato chips. The fruits, especially berries were very cheap compared to the part of the world that I come from. However take note if berries (black berries, raspberries) are going at GBP1 per box, it is probably going to spoil. Loved all the sights of the bustling market and also bought 2 bottles of truffle oil back. I wanted to come back again during my trip but unfortunately there was a terror attack that night and it was closed the next few days. I'll definitely return on my subsequent trips to London. Combined this trip with a walk down the River Thames and to the Tower Bridge. Closest underground station: London Bridge||June 17, 2017
Bastet101||50||I love this market even though it gets quite busy with tourists. Visited on Saturday, the first weekend after the terrorist attack. The market was no where as busy as normal and this saddened me. The traders need our support. The variety of food here is fantastic and the quality is second to none. Fish, meat, bread, cheese, fruit and veg and specialty food from around the world. Every trader cares so much about their produce. I wish I lived nearer and could shop here more often. There are few markets like this left in the U.K. Please visit the market and support the traders by buying from their stalls.||June 17, 2017
David G||50||We walked to Borough Market just after checking into our hotel. We had heard a lot about it and wanted to experience it for ourselves. We loved walking around and looking at all of the different food vendors that were set up around the market. You can definitely find anything that you happen to be hungry for. We really enjoyed spending part of our afternoon here and would recommend it to anyone visiting London.||June 16, 2017
950NikkiB||50||What a wonderful food market, I think it must sell all the food you could possibly want. The smell of food being cooked made me feel really hungry. We went on a Friday just before lunchtime, it was busy of course but not crazily so. My husband loves the confit of duck ciabatta and has one every time he goes. Definitely worth a visit.||June 16, 2017
ASarkarM||30||I'm surprised to see the raving reviews here. Yes, Borough Market is a lively market that takes you into a world that is buzzing with people and food. However, since this is a food market, the food itself was an important parameter for me to judge the place. Unfortunately, this is where Borough disappoints. The food was not great in taste and was definitely quite overpriced. I read a lot of reviews about the best stalls before visiting the market, but unfortunately the food wasn't memorable in any of them. If you're visiting London for the first time, go to Borough Market for the lively atmosphere. But only eat a snack or two. Save your money here, and later spend it at London's many fantastic restaurants.||June 16, 2017
Yarril||50||The diverse food options is out of this world! Name it, I am sure they have it! Even if you do not feel like eating, I think exploring the Borough Market is worth it especially if you are a foodie or.. you just love food. We ate the Paella which was delicious. No wonder for it seems like a hit among visitors as there was always a line. If I had to pick a favorite stall, the Spice Mountain would have to be it.||June 15, 2017
Ginerochi||50||This market located near to borough tube station is one of the biggest market on London, it has plenty of options of food boxes to eat, drink and buy vegetables, fruits, cookies and chocolates. Isn't a cheap place but you find quality and good products.||June 15, 2017

kamakshi2015||50||A walk here takes to nostalgia of the times - people loved coming to the market . The numerous shop attracts you with variety of the goods . The food shops here will actually tempt you you eat here . A very charming place with lots of hustle bustle . The old scenes have unfolded to the present . A very relaxing activity if you have time to relax - not place for a hurried trevaler . The access is easy and effortless . Must visit .,||June 13, 2017

JasonMcfly||40||This was my first time to borough market in all my trips to england. I will say this go during the week as weekends are far more busy. I went Very hungry, knowing I would get all the food I wanted. Went on a thursday around noon. There are SO many food stalls, it really is impressive to see. I walked around, took photos, and really decided what I wanted. Ended up with a Duck sandwich, then got a foot long brat, and finished it off with some cheese cake. So much more I could have gotten but my stomach was full. Definitely worth the visit, the market is an amazing experience. I'll likely go back again when I visit in November.||June 12, 2017
CalgaryLucky13||50||What a wonderful market with lots of hustle and bustle. We really enjoyed the variety of vendors and the quality of offerings. Be sure to try the country cider stall.||June 12, 2017
Magline||50||Very well organized and clean. Wonderful busy atmosphere with so much to eat and purchase, the variety spans the globe. It is a must do for me every time I visit London and on all the occasions I carry someone they are always pleasantly surprised. You need to go.||June 12, 2017
adrianloh||50||We visited Borough Market on the morning of 3 June 2017 - later that night, some terrorists attacked the area and killed many, and injured many more. Please visit Borough Market and help the business people and traders there as they deserve your patronage. I found the market people incredibly warm and kind and friendly and it was a great way to while away a couple of hours just going around and tasting the amazing variety of foodstuffs available for sale. We had the sausage batty and a beef pie for breakfast as well as 10 oysters and some figs and strawberries. Apart from that, we also bought some truffle flavoured oil, some extra virgin olive oil and some dips. Oh and do try to goat milk ice cream too - the salted caramel flavour was amazing!!!I will definitely come again.||June 12, 2017
Wawabear||30||I am sorry to place a 3 out of 5 rating- The middle rating does not reflect the Market itself!! We walked from our hotel "Park Plaza Hôtel " to find the market has not reopened after the attack the first part of June. Very sad!||June 12, 2017
Ceciliayw||40||We were there in the morning on the day of terrorist attack. It is a market full of local cultural where all tourists must go if they visit London.||June 11, 2017
mrecs||40||Lots of food to choose from. If you love cheese, this place is for you. Sausages, raclette, fish and chips, wraps, ice cream, drinks, and a lot more. It gets crowded at times though. Must do while in London.||June 10, 2017
turbocharged_living||50||This is the heart of London Food. Where you can find local produce and the best of's in London including fish and chips, Dutch eggs, sausage rolls, donuts etc. suitable for everyone including meats, cheeses, truffles, vegan and vego options, we came here 3 times on our trip just amazing||June 10, 2017

urbandlegend||50||If ur a die hard foodie like me then this is the place to visit, loads of history as well behind the market but absolutely amazing. I could've spent 3 days in here. Food to die for, friendly people & markets as far as u can see. All sorts of great food goodies can be bought here. A must do while visiting London. Have to go back me thinks||June 9, 2017
Montyf1||50||.Best served with friends and family but even solo you won't feel alone. So much a part of London yet an amazing range of top food from around the world. A quick lunch always turns into visits to at least 3 stalls. Great pubs. A cider stall with attitude. Been 100's of times, celebrated birthdays and Christmases but always something new. Bar and restaurant staff who put customers before themselves .... And Bridget Jones lived there. What more do you want? Looking forward to providing my own form of support again soon||June 8, 2017
Soniaferdi||40||Pies, oysters, raclette and potatoes, indian, mexican, asiatic and all others...i really enjoyed and appreciated all market trucks.||June 8, 2017

mimiring||50||Can explore wide range of food culture in UK. Fun walking! Not far from towerbridge. Good stroll for weekend with grabbing a yammy gelato from the market. Highly recommend :) I tried Scotch egg for the first time. Not my type (too heavy) but it was cultural experience for me so it was fun!||June 7, 2017
amandav773||40||So much fun! A great way to chill for an hour or the day! Don't let evil change its way. The food stalls are fun and diverse and you can get prosecco to go!||June 6, 2017
Lkindo||40||I had been advised to try and visit this market and I was not disappointed. There are lots of stalls selling all types of produce plus Street food from all over the world. Unfortunately I was looking for a breakfast which narrowed the choice little.||June 6, 2017
Katey_xoxo||50||Never heard or been here before! Went with family who lives in London and absolutely loved this market and everything about it! Vast amount of food and its variety was amazing wish I could have tried everything there! We opted for Ethiopian food which was lush!Atmosphere and people are friendly! Will definitely be going back again!||June 6, 2017
JohnCaz7||50||Borough Market is a special place. One of the worlds oldest markets it has such character. We visited for a light breakfast, had a walk around the SouthBank then back again to sample the many stalls offering free tastes. If you like wine and cheese, then this is the place to go. Great choice and value in an historic part of London||June 6, 2017
Crystalism||50||Borough Market is still my favourite place to go for small bites. It's the place I bring friends to when they visit London and they love it.There are a lot of tourists flocking in everyday, but locals do visit as well... Especially during lunch hour. It's one of my favourite place to visit in London for oysters. If you want to buy food souvenirs back, this place has everything. Cheese, ham, truffle, bread, etc. There are also fresh fruits and vegetables, definitely fresher than Tescos!Yes it's expensive, but hello it's London, what do you expect? 10p per oyster? You can get 6 oysters for 6-8 quids - it's actually pretty affordable as compared to eating in restaurants.||June 5, 2017
Andrew R||50||We visited the Borough Market on our last day in London. With sadness the day of the night of the recent terrorist attack.We spent a lovely 4 hours walking around the market and tasting foods from the artisanal producers. We ended our visit with a jug of Pimms which was a lovely way to end the stay in London.We were devastated to hear later that day of the attack.When the market is open again, this is a great place to visit.||June 5, 2017
JohnT795||30||Each time i visit Borough market, I'm impressed with the choice of specialist fayre, the friendliness of the staff operating the myriad of fresh and fast food outlets, but disappointed by the total lack of value. One has to question the overall hygiene in certain cases, but perhaps this comment is a bit harsh in view of the setting (It's not a Restaurant after all) but any open air food venue must be thus viewed in any sensible terms too.It's great for fresh food. Meat, Cheeses Vegetables and specialised Fruit, while the cook-while-you-wait joints offer a good selection of world cuisine, but if you pay £7 you're paying £1-2 over the odds, so it's really a bit too dear even in this trendy part of London. Overall, worth a visit, but always consider if the price is fair or inflated.||June 5, 2017
G7508LNrichardp||50||Don't eat before visiting... went with fiancée and her brother who is a big fan of this place.Lots of shops/stalls selling home-made produce, which made for a great atmosphere and lots of choice in what you have. I went for a reasonably pricey cake from one of the stalls; it was a good choice. I hope to come back again to try some of the main food; as we usually stay in Waterloo on London visits this should happen!||June 5, 2017
GwynethG306||40||Be prepared to be jostled and crammed in to this upmarket market! Very trendy with lots of food stalls and 'street food' vendors vying for business; fairly pricey but to be expected as it is popular with tourists, in a bustling part of London and on the foodie trail!||June 5, 2017
thegeorges56||50||having seen YouTube videos of Borough Market, we decided that we must spend an afternoon here and that was the best decision we made. Loved the place for its friendly atmosphere and variety of food. Wish we had more days to spend in London so we could visit again. Sad that terrorists attacked this very place two days back. I am sure the market will not get cowed down by this terrible act by cowards ||June 4, 2017
Wireb0y||50||We have visited Borough market each time during 3 trips to London, & it has become a must for us to visit. It is very large without being too big to see and enjoy it all; there are food (fresh and prepared) vendors selling products from all over Europe-the usual suspects, France, Germany, Italy and Spain- as well as far-away places, such as, Croatia and Greece. And, of course from all over the UK and Republic of Ireland. The prepared foods are outstanding, as are the many restaurants on the periphery of the market. For the limited-baggage tourist, there are many non-food items to buy that are light and don't take much room; e.g., there is a wonderful kitchen shop that has great, useful gadgets, and a chocolate, coffee and tea shop selling interesting products, including products of up to 100% cocoa which is a great place to rest and have a cup of hot or cold chocolate, coffee or tea-always our first stop when visiting the market. Tube stop (London Bridge) entrance is 20 meters away!||June 4, 2017
billcotton||40||After recommendations from friends and family, we decided to come here to see what people liked about it so much. We had a great couple of hours wandering around the market, looking at the various stalls and the various produce that they were offering. Well worth a visit.||June 4, 2017
B6083IPjusting||30||Go with an empty stomach and a Full Wallet. Interesting foods and drinks available but unfortunately mostly at vastly inflated prices...Purchased some fresh fruits but had gone mouldy by the next day?! ||June 4, 2017
flipinny||50||I love markets and food halls, so naturally Borough Market was on my list. Well, it was well worth visiting. Great food, great people, and great location. A must for anyone. Bring cash.||June 4, 2017
theduckies11||50||So many things to choose from! Take a full walk around before spending money (and tummy space). Many options for vegan, gluten free, special diets. Highlights for us were the Spanish chorizo, kappecasein deli, and the street food section. Never saw a toilet so not sure if there are public ones. ||June 4, 2017
eliza_llama||50||Borough market consists of lots of food stalls selling every food imaginable - some to consume there and some to take home. Think cheese, meat, vegetables, jams, chillies, bread, wine.There is also a bakery school with huge glass windows. We could watch the people inside making various items which was very interesting.||June 4, 2017
Glutenfreefeedz||50||This place is the best market for true food lovers. Samples aplenty of cheese, chutney, chocolate, charcuterie and just about anything else you can think of. The perfect market to head to on a Saturday morning, grab some cheese and a bottle of wine and head to the park and enjoy!||June 3, 2017
Mimielah||50||We arrived at lunch time and quickly scored a table and one by one went to pick out our choice of food and drink. it was a great crowd and very busy but everyone was courteous and the food choices excellent. After we ate we walked around the whole market as it is quite big. Besides food and drink there were a few other quality vendors selling their items.||June 3, 2017
Tory A||50||I can't say I like going to markets in general, but Borough Market is special and simply amazing place. Any food you like, fresh and of highest quality is there! Fruits, berries, vegetables, pastries, seafood, meat and cheese - everything is fresh, looks and smells good. Some of the stores will cook for you the goods you just bought.You can taste almost anything, the food is freshly made at the market. Ever wanted to try a crocodile or kangaroo meat? There is a store selling it. Love seafood? Prawns, scallops and oysters will be prepared for you on the spot. Crafted beer of home made wine? There it is! Fresh juice from various fruits to refresh yourself? Sure! Cheese, jams, pies, coffee, spices... I simply can't name it all.If you come early you can see some of the food being cooked in front of your eyes, avoid the crowd and see the full range of goods as some thing are sold out pretty fast.||June 3, 2017
Christopher L||50||As the title suggests, if you love food then this is the place to visit. My family and I visited here on Thursday the 1st of June 2017. The Market was literally a 5 minute walk from our hotel and we decided to visit on the way to The City. We were all totally amazed at the variety of food on offer, there was something for every taste. My wife and daughter decided on vegan burgers even though they are not vegan. It was just they looked and tasted unlike any other burger they had ever eaten. My son and I decided on the 12 hour pulled pork solution to our hunger, again it was really tasty. I should add that it was not too expensive considering the fresh and tasty ingredients and the way everything is presented. We could have spent longer around the market just looking at the array of cheeses, breads, fish, fruit and meats available. Borough Market will certainly be on our list of places to visit when we next venture to London.||June 3, 2017
Roadiez||50||Good ambience. Varierty of street food all over the market. Fresh seafood, meats, cheese, veggies, sweets, fruits. Brilliant garlic prawns on the road. Lots of places to eat, drink and have great time. Love the place.||June 2, 2017
Martin F||50||If you like to binge, this is the place to be. This covered outdoor market is a joy ride for the palate. The food is fresh and the flavors are extraordinary. Want to buy food to bring back to your rental apartment to prepare yourself? They have it all and it looks amazing. Or do what I have done whenever I visit London. Go there VERY hungry and then sample as much as you can. There are so many booths representing so many different types of food it would be pointless to try and itemize them here. The point is there is more than enough for everyone no matter what you prefer. The people are great, the vibe is wonderful and the food is as flavorful as you could ever hope for||June 2, 2017
rubymoose||50||Any type of food you're looking for, you can find at Borough Market. It's huge and has tons of stalls and shops with produce, meat, fish, dairy/cheese, jam, baked goods, wines... Everything. Our favorite market in London!||June 2, 2017
Mark H||50||What a brilliant place to find outstanding local and international produce. We purchased a large array of cheeses, meats, pates, olives, tomatoes, bread etc to take away with us into the countryside. What a feast and what and fantastic place. I had the best oysters ever, so salty fresh and so French. Amazing. I thought oysters from NZ were the best in the world but these were the equal if not better. We also ate there too and the aged wild boar bun was tremendously tasty.||June 2, 2017
futtock21||50||London's greatest food market. Specialist cheeses from all over the world in one location. Butcher's selling whole Spanish rabbit. Salami paradise in another corner. Lots of stalls selling street food. A cookery demonstration. Restaurants both within the cartilage of the market such as Roast as well as around the exterior. Applebee's for fish and Lobos for Spanish barbecued meats probably my personal favourites. A little further afield Vinoteca, Brindisa (Spanish tapas again), Tas. Monmouth Coffee. Probably slightly closer to London Bridge than Borough tube.||June 1, 2017
Em B||40||Literally stumbled into the market while walking back to our hotel. We didn't stay long as we were running late for evening plans but that didn't stop me from buying some macarons. The macarons were good but pricey which doesn't say much because they're always expensive. It was probably a good idea we didn't stick around because all the food looked sooo good. I'd go back for sure.||June 1, 2017
durkdye81||50||We tried everything! Chorizo, cheese, fish-n-chips, Thai and vegetarian Indian food. It was amazing. Wander through and try samples. Then buy yourself a delicious lunch!!||June 1, 2017
Luana F||50||Food from everywhere! I wanted to try everything. Very interesting if you enjoy eating (who doesn't?).||June 1, 2017
gordotl1||50||Imagine a market with locally sourced cheeses, sausages from the a English and French countryside, Greek olive oils. Freshly made breads and preserves. Many are available for tasting at the many stalls. Add ready-made food purveyors (grass-fed beef burgers, venison burgers, wild boar hot dogs, Nepalese chicken curry (which we had today) - and, you have a place where people who love food can get their 'fix'.My favorite time to get their is around 2 pm (crowds are thinner), then grab a glass of Prosecco and wander about the food stalls.It can be busy at lunch or on the weekends, so just enjoy the people watching.||June 1, 2017
eof025||50||Borough Market has something for everyone. Great places to eat, interesting and unique shops..a barber. We walked here from Tower of London over the London Bridge, 20-25 minute walk. Be sure to time your visit when hungry, too many places to eat to choose from.||June 1, 2017
PHE22||40||great place to wander and buy specialist foods such as cheese. Also great restaurants surrounding it and street food. Still unlike some other modernised markets keeps its market character||June 1, 2017
ElisaD438||40||This market is a perfect spot to get fresh produce, as well as some specialties such as cheeses, sausages, spices and wine. There are samples everywhere to try including the prepared food. Came here after some sight seeing and its a foodie's dream with the variety offered. We were a group of 6 and each one of us ordered lunch from different stands (including vegan), which everyone enjoyed. Afterwards, we headed to Monmouth Cafe for one of the best cup of coffees I had in London!Note, the market does get crowded especially around lunch time, so keep that in mind. I don't like crowded places, but if you go there knowing it, you will enjoy what the market has to offer.||May 31, 2017
Kgirl00||50||There were so many food options, and it was so hard to choose because it all looked amazing! We ended up with slow-cooked lamb and rice, a roast hog sandwich, and goats milk ice cream. It was all perfect, delicious, and inexpensive!||May 31, 2017
geromam||40||You would be hard pressed not to find your food of choice here. What a wide variety! If you find something you like just go for it, as there is so much to treat the nose and eyes! And although it is a tourist hot spot, prices weren't too bad, either. I went for Balkan food, a very tasty vegetarian lunchbox. After I'd bought what I wanted, I walked past other foods that looked equally as tantalising but I was happy with my choice. Yes, definitely a place to visit when the tummy needs filling! Only trouble is finding a place to eat. Not many places freely available. Local businesses understandably are not happy with people sitting on their steps!||May 31, 2017
ramonaf668||50||Borough Market is a must do. Lots of stalls and food and drink to explore. Some have samples as well. ||May 31, 2017
kaths375||40||We were staying near St Pauls and happened upon this as we went for a stroll over Millennium bridge!It was a warren of stalls and interesting goodies-with lots to see and taste!!It was crowded as it was a Saturday afternoon but everything looked (and tasted !) delicious!A real find and definitely a place to visit again and again!||May 30, 2017
Tamara N||50||This market is exactly what you'd expect from a street food market. Its buzzing with people and a big variety of food, drink and dessert kiosks. Spent a nice couple of hours there sampling different foods.||May 30, 2017
traveller20151005||50||This place has been a food market since the year 1014, before the Battle of Hastings! Sells good food. I particularly likes its Olives stores and Oysters store. Its only shortcoming is the fact that it is actually not very big. Worth going at least once though.||May 30, 2017
Louisa D||50||Great food good prices. A lot of selection, the meat pie stand was our favourite highly recommended.||May 30, 2017
AmbridgeGirl||40||Located in the perfect spot this market has everything. Lots of eateries and very chic and upmarket stalls - cheese, meats, fresh fish and other stalls. You could spend a good hour or so wandering round. Plenty to see in that area - Southwark Cathedral, Southwark, London and Millenium Bridges, The Shard, Golden Hind, Tate Modern. Definitely worth a visit.||May 30, 2017
616simon||40||If you are near London Bridge or Southwark you must visit Borough Market. A great open air but under cover market Where you can buy all sorts of fresh food and produce or eat in one of the many restaurants and stalls on site or nearby. A crowded place with a great atmosphere which is really part of London.||May 30, 2017
NickJ453||50||Well you have to admit this is a great place The street food was fantastic. Great atmosphere So much to see. I crave to go back ||May 30, 2017
Bebo077||50||This is a great market place crowded with delicious food ether cooked in some way or completely fresh. Must see for all foodies.||May 30, 2017
northants90||40||Literally stumbled across this place by accident on a walk through London and what a treasure to find. It is an old style London Market with a wide range of market stalls in a real unique layout. A real good find and excellent to place to lose yourself for a while. ||May 29, 2017
RustonTraveller||50||Expect big crowd's on a Saturday--but it's worth it. There are food vendors from all over Europe, selling both cooked food and raw/fresh ingredients for you to take home and cook. It's a great place to try something new. ||May 29, 2017
mayuda1||50||A colorful market with verity of tastes and flavors. Only wish i could try them all...We've been there on Monday and it was wide open with many stands.||May 29, 2017

Go go go experience it take plenty of money with you. ||May 29, 2017
Bakes60||50||We took the Harry Potter walking tour and stumbled into this. The person I had been traveling with had been to London four times and had never been here. It was a fantastic mix of so many different foods, people and smells! Definitely a place to check out.||May 28, 2017
877sheilal||40||We stayed at a hotel near Borough Market, what a perfect location with this market so close. We stopped by almost everyday for coffee, tea, breakfast and/or lunch. There is a really good mix of vendors for cheese, olives, wine, vegetables, break and baked good, meats and meals etc. etc! If we lived near a market like this at home we would meal plan day to day based on what was selling in the market. It is definitely worth a visit and I would suggest that you make sure you are hungry when you go, between the samples and the food options you won't be disappointed.||May 28, 2017
Vilmis Z||50||Every time different experience and I feel like I will never have enough of Borough Market! Great selection of cuisines, drinks and vibrant atmosphere always leaves me and my guests happy. Perfect place to take your friends and family. ||May 28, 2017
Calvani||50||From the sea to the paddocks, Borough Markets has it all. A food lovers must visit. Make sure you have a freshly shucked oyster or shaved meats of all kinds. Takeaway a loaf of bread or even a sweet treat with a coffee.||May 27, 2017
kvh71||50||Visited very early on a Saturday morning and the stalls looked amazing. This market features the great and the good from top London producers. Excellent for cheese, fruit & veg, and meat. By the time we left (midday) it was getting ridiculously busy and unpleasant. For the best experience go early. ||May 27, 2017
AllanKPB||50||Lots of stuff here. Go for lunch -- many different favours for any taste preference. Actually too much to talk about. We bought bread, ice cream, oysters, etc. All excellent. Go . Packed with people. ||May 27, 2017
silent_21||50||if you go with a group I recommend you eat everything and share though so you can try everything and not get as full. Great place.!||May 26, 2017
SarahG879||50||Love borough market! I always stroll through here whenever i am in london bridge! The stalls are so interesting and the street food smells amazing. The area is so cool and you will recognise parts of it from a few films! The market vendors are really helpful and friendly and you will see loads of things you may not have seen before!||May 26, 2017
Pat B||50||I went to Southwark from the Royal Observatory especially to see this market. The variety and quality of the foods, cheeses, olive oils, and spice shops is grand.||May 26, 2017
denver60||50||We visited the Borough Market on the recommendation of local friends. The selection of food on offer is simply mind boggling and there is something to appeal to every taste. Seating is at a premium (scarce) and the place is quite crowded but everything that we tried was very good. We also bought some good wine. Great way to spend an afternoon.||May 26, 2017
Jonas T||50||If you are in for treats.... go to this market. It is a fantastic place. Fx go look for a Belgian cheese called L'exquis Herve... maybe the best cheese you have ever tasted||May 26, 2017
pierrebunton||50||Go there!!!!If I could only write two words, see above!Everything you could possibly want from a food-market.Everything from fudge to samosas, from juice to burgers.And all of it is great.Just promise me one thing:GO THERE!!!||May 25, 2017
joslynb2017||50||My friends and I went and visited another friend from London she took us here for lunch and it was wonderful. I had pulled pork with mac and cheese, the best I had. We also split a pitcher of Pimms ( I think that's what it was) which is a drink I have only found in England. The stand had pitchers of Sangrias and Pimms, our friend from there suggested we do the Pimms one. There were a lot of great little stands and in the market for food to take home or eat there and other things like desserts. Awesome environment, but pretty crowded so keep that in mind! Have fun and safe travels! ||May 25, 2017
FamilyG_2016||50||The market has many great food places covering all different types of food many giving free tasters. If you are hungry all cooked foods are also available from fish and chips through to ethiopian.||May 25, 2017
Nallycat||50||Fabulous selection of foods in an historic landmark. go early to get the best. also great street food to eat on the go if you dont have cooking facilities.||May 25, 2017
slovenia8||50||If you like food – eating or just watching – this is the place for you. You can eat or buy any food or wine you can imagine here. But expect to be very crowded, so much that you won’t be able to walk in your own pace but with the crowed. Expect to eat standing in some corner or near the fence with people passing all the time.||May 25, 2017
carleewalk||50||Go here hungry because it is mostly food vendors. Everything we tried was delicious. You don't need more than an hour or two because there wasn't much besides the food. Also, public seating is scarce so probably not good for kids.||May 24, 2017
dancemama||50||A food frenzy abounds. Fresh foods, foods to go, jams,jellies, crafts, beer, wine, sit down, take away. Pastries, breads, sweets, fresh seafood. Busy bustling must visit place on a Friday. Plan to eat an array of weirdly, authentic foods.||May 24, 2017
Jojo4470||40||There are so many different types of food here from all over the world. Meats Cheeses, pies. You name it, its here. Very crowded, but that's part of the fun. Plan on spending two hours here at least.||May 24, 2017
JstAnotherEnglishman||50||My wife and I have been here many times before. We came here again today and it was the same as every other time. Such a vast variety of amazing food from all different cultures and styles. We had oysters from richardhawardoysters which were amazing. We then moved onto duck wrap and salad and finished off with a fresh fruit drink and chocolate brownie & carrot cake. Although there is so much choice here: Chinese, Turkish, Thai, Indian, Mexican, an entire seafood range, range of different meats. If you can think of it they probably have it. I would highly recommend visiting this market if you are in London as it's the best place to get good food. The only problem with this market is that I can't eat it all in one visit and so I have to keep going back to try new things.||May 24, 2017
yaojoy||50||This place is amazing. Foodies, like me will just love it. Go early in the morning as by afternoon it is impossible to get through the crowds. Make sure you check the schedule of when the full market is open. My only regret is that my kids came hungry and as a result chose early ordered with their stomachs and not their heads. As a result, I had to order less items. There's traditional English meat pies, there's turkish coffee and sweets, there's Ethiopian, there's Jamaican, and more. I only regret that we stayed in a hotel and thus was not able to buy any of the beautiful mushrooms, sausages, cheeses, meats, special spices etc. that were available for cooking. I loved this place and would have gone back if time allowed.||May 24, 2017
eMBieAntwerp||50||After 5 citytrips to London we just now discovered this nice place.It reminded us on a Tuscan market but, English style off course.So many food stalls, so many tastes, such a lovely area, lot of people/visitors too, pity that we had half board in our hotel and couldn't taste all of it. A must see when visiting London !.||May 24, 2017
24lorraineS||20||We walked through this area under the bridge end on the way to the Tower of London. It was lunch time and very busy with a vast series of under tent food vendors. The aromas were great however, I would question preparation and cleanliness. You have to stand and eat to take it elsewhere. Good for young folks.||May 24, 2017
jameshY4767ZZ||50||Love the feel of borough market, so many smells of great food.Many good restaurants such as Applebee's for fish or birindisa for tapas.Worth a visit.||May 23, 2017
maggie h||50||Saturday is the day if you plan to visit Borough market. As half of the market would be closed on a regular date and Sunday the whole market would be closed. The middle of the hall had amazing food. We loved the local product as salami, truffle oils and sauce.||May 23, 2017
clarebellwood71||50||A brilliant market especially if your into food. Plenty of varieties from different countries. Great atmosphere. We went on a Saturday Afternoon it was heaving. Plenty of food to try but even more to buy so take plenty of money. A great afternoon.||May 23, 2017
mpike79||50||This was one of the best outdoor markets I have ever been too. From the spice kiosk to the Italian specialty markets everything was fresh and delicious. You can get a taste of anything and everything. I tasted the best paella, yes paella in England, that I ever tasted. Go hungry and spend time.||May 23, 2017
specialplant||40||Bratwurst, scotch eggs, pad thai, fresh oysters, best fish&chips. Spend an hour here to grab lunch then head over to Southbank for a nice stroll||May 23, 2017
joannawC2698SB||40||My husband and I use to live in London and this market. You can find lots of fresh fruit and veg, good meats and fish, and other small things like pickle or bread etc. Certain bits of the market sell cooked food, while others souvenirs. There is certainly lots of things to do and see. We loved the market even though certain stoles are bit pricy. It is definitely more expensive than supermarkets but usually the quality of the product is better than the one find in shops. You can easily kill few h there. ||May 22, 2017
roiereg||50||The 1st. place in London that makes me smile and happiness every visit. You can find there meat, vegetables, cakes, culinary products from many places in the world. Amazing for culinary lovers ||May 22, 2017
MichaelBayArea||40||You will find a variety of fresh raw and cooked food inside the market. A variety of food from snacks to full meals are available. We tried a few food stalls and they were all good. But make sure you check the market days/hours as not all stalls are open all days. The specialty tea and spices stores are worth a visit.||May 22, 2017
lizm54||50||what a wonderful place - I don't think there is any food that you can't find here - I wanted to buy everything. It is not a traditional cheap market but stalls that sell local and home produced produce. Cheeses from all over Europe ( I have never seen such a selection) cooked meats, sauces, spices and of course many take away eaterie stalls all selling freshly produced meals. Could have wandered around all day - the only problem is that you would probably have to waddle home you would eat so much - it is really tempting!||May 21, 2017
wholewideworld||50||Bustling Borough Market is fun for hungry travelers! There are dozens of foods to choose from in a fun covered market atmosphere. Don't miss the grilled cheese takeaway and Monmouth Coffee!||May 21, 2017
Michele L||50||Can be a bit busy at weekends but it's worth taking that deep breath and stepping into the crowds! Located underneath the railway there are lots of stalls selling fresh food and produce. Plenty of samples (cheeses and biscuits but follow the signs for the toilets and there are spirits to try too!). Great atmosphere.||May 21, 2017
Daniel C||50||If you're in London and love food make sure you stop by here once, twice, ok as many times as you can.It's a food lovers wonderland, the smells, sights and stalls will have something for all tastes. ||May 21, 2017
katiet4700||50||What an exciting street food market!!! Just wander and graze all day. We were there on a Saturday afternoon. Grab a drink, hang out, do some people watching, and keep eating. Come hungry and be ready to do a lot of standing and weaving around the crowds. Markets are the classically exciting part of any city...for thousands of years! Come experience this one. You will not be disappointed. I visited as a tourist and it was nice to feel like these were not the normal touristy crowds we were used to.||May 20, 2017
BarryfromLondon||10||Stay clear of Borough Market unless you enjoy being ripped off and want mild food poisoning.I paid £12 for a chicken, which is 4x the price of Sainsbury's. It also had 4x the water in it, which came flooding out whilst carving.I also paid £10 for a venison saucisson. It was off, yes off!Everything here is massively overpriced. You can buy better quality from Selfridges!||May 20, 2017
es-travler||50||If you are visiting London put this market on your agenda for lunch time. A perfect place to finish after a morning exploration of the south side of the River Thames, or a great place to start before exploring in the afternoon.||May 19, 2017
JessicaGege||50||Great place to visit!! So many choices with its international cousine: from Italy, France, Spain...You can either eat at the market or do your grocery shopping to take home. Definitely raccomended!||May 19, 2017
paolabuendia||50||Go hungry. Really hungry. There is really nothing else to do here but eat and the food is delish. Plenty of great sites to walk to afterwards.||May 19, 2017
stjtrip||40||Open air market with many stalls specializing in a variety of food such as cheeses, wines, charcuterie, english dishes, exoctic meats, fresh seafood and so much more. Great place to graze for lunch or dinner to eat a variety of different cuisines. Not cheap but definitely cheaper than a sit-down restaurant. Note, you will basically need to eat standing-up or sitting on the curb as there is limited public seating. I made it a point to visit multiple times on my vacation to London.||May 18, 2017
Y7521XVemmaj||50||What a fantastic food market some treasures to be found. We spent about 3 hours walking around. We arrived at about midday on a Saturday, it was very very busy so when I go again I will go earlier in the day. We ate at the Indian Street food stall, great food tasted great. The whole place has a great buzz about it, a thoroughly lovely place, well worth a visit. ||May 18, 2017
carlhenrikp||50||While strolling around here, you want to buy most of the high quality vegetables, mest, fish and other groceries. We ended up with porbeagle (sillhaj) a type of mackerel shark that was excellent to barbeque. And some exclusive Japanese green tea.||May 18, 2017
GeorgeDam1976||50||We've been a couple of times and we love it. You can find everything you need from fish, cheese, meat , veggies and fruits. You can choose to eat from a lot of cuisines. The only minus it's that you can't find any seats and you have to eat standing! We return every time we are in London!||May 18, 2017
suecB7042UJ||40||This market is great on so many levels. Visually it is stunning, just walking around and looking is a special treat. But, the food! There is something for everyone. From ice cream to Egyptian street food, to a whole pig roasting on a spit, to sausages, gourmet cheeses, paella, to raw oysters and on and on and on. There are also great veg and fruit vendors, fishmongers and butchers. My only complaint is that there could be more seating options. Some food is tough to eat standing up. ||May 18, 2017
John M||40||A characterful market based mainly under the railway arches near London Bridge Station. Lots of stalls/stands selling a wide range of fresh produce at reasonable prices. There are a number of cooked food stalls in the market so you can get a snack/meal on the hoof so to speak. If you don't like crowds go mid-week, but if you like the atmosphere of a really crowded market go at the week-end when there are more tourists. Southwark cathedral, The Globe Theatre and the Golden Hinde are close by so there is lots to do in this area of London south of the river.||May 18, 2017
dimitribaeten||50||Fantastic little market to have some local food, full of little stands, cheese, meat, local products, a good way to have a pitstop inbetween musea. You will enjoy.||May 17, 2017
KuleDude||40||We visited on a Monday, when not all of the stalls were open - but certainly enough to keep us interested during an hour's wandering round.Lots of street food on offer, with tempting smells.||May 17, 2017
Margaret M||50||Although several people had recommended Borough Markets to us as a place to experience I was still surprised at how amazing it was. The range, freshness and quality of the produce and other food and drinks on offer was incredible. We only had a short time to look around and sample its delights so we would recommend you allow plenty of time when you go to visit.||May 16, 2017
sullivision||50||This is a great market for food. We started off going through here on the way to Leadenhall Market and were so disappointing with the food options we walked back across the bridge to Borough Market. Everything from street food and pastries to full meals are available. We went to the Whisky Ginger Burger stall and had a great burger and chips. One thing to consider, there is limited seating here, unless we missed it somehow, so if you were hoping to relax after walking across London Bridge three times you may need to camp a space.||May 16, 2017
Taxidevil||40||We love to visit Borough Market everytime that we are in London but on this visit it was so busy we could hardly move.If you want to visit come early when it is quieter.||May 16, 2017
Dale M||40||The different foods on offer at this market makes your head spin! The range and variety of meats, cheeses, breads, etc makes it very hard to make a selection. There are plenty of choices for lunch, too. The only downside I found was wanting somewhere to sit and eat the takeaway lunch I had bought. It was crowded but the atmosphere was great.||May 15, 2017
bigdreamz73||50||What a flavorful place to visit. No matter what kind of foody you are, you'll find your spot and expand even further. A must place to visit in London!! ||May 15, 2017
Lisajane65||50||So much to choose from in this market. Lovely hot food stalls, we had frankfurters and chicken noodle dishes. Also bought some lovely olive baguettes from the bakery stall. Really enjoyed our visit and will return soon. ||May 15, 2017
nellielim||50||This is an excellent place to have breakfast or lunch. The range of gourmet food here is incredible with their tantalising aromas and flavours. There is also a range of cheeses, meats, fresh vegetables and fruits and breads that are on sale here. One of the best food markets we have visited.||May 15, 2017
simonej799||50||There are almost too many options, and everything looks great. The hard part is to choose. Go grab your lunch and eat it outdoors. The juices were amazing.||May 15, 2017
Moirg||40||Definitely worth a visit if you are a foodie. Don't bother too much with breakfast save it for the free samples and a great choice of lunch time treats to send taste buds into a frenzy, I recommend the street food section for lunch or one of the exciting burgers on offer.Free samples of cheese, meats, fresh bread and oils create a fun experience making it hard not to buy. The displays o foods are excellent on the eye, and the sound of the trains above added to the contained buzz in this beautiful example of historical London architecture. Down side is the over London deli prices and the lack of toilet facilities, but will definitely be visiting again.||May 14, 2017
IanMac1960||50||This is like an open air top range delicatessen. It is a mass of market stalls selling every foodstuff imaginable. You can taste test to your heart's desire and when you finally decide to buy it will be fantastic. My Colombian Coffee was very tasty as well as was my Spinach and Feta croissant. The market gets very busy and you need to be alert but it all adds to the experience. The market also offers excellent people watching opportunities.||May 14, 2017
zoe s||50||This is a place to buy local food: meat, fruits, vegetables, toasts, take-away food... It also has a glass room for a sitting and resting. A restaurant called "TOAST" is on second floor overview the whole market,--- not right time for me, but a local friend told me it worth the money. Beautiful Victoria Steal structure is the highlight, and the atmosphere is friendly.||May 13, 2017
David C||50||We try to call in the market every time we visit London. Dress comfortably and skip breakfast before you face the amazing , tantalising temptations from around the world. We love , particularly if it's chilly , the small restaurants where you can sample the fab reds with tapas type dining. But wander around and sample hand held dining at its best. Also spices, flowers and other stalls will tempt you to visit time after time . Love ❤️ ||May 13, 2017
remelynd2017||50||It was quite an experience to see wide range of food, drinks, fruits etc Smell and atmosphere was great. My tummy and eyes are so overwhelmed and happy ||May 13, 2017
Bruins2003||50||Went here right before my flight to the states. Everything you could want and more is here to eat. We went with the salted beef sandwich and the fish and chips. Both were excellent! There's plenty of oils cheeses and meats to buy here to. A must do ||May 12, 2017
filiphorak||40||Borough market offers plenty of options, I went for cod&chips in fish! and it was excellent! Advertised national prize for fish&chips seems to be deserved. Just few places to sit outside, but if you are fine with take-away, perfect choice.||May 12, 2017
Colin E||40||Before visiting check the Borough Market website for the opening hours. At the weekend the market gets very crowded from mid-morning, on other days when the market is open, it is busy at lunchtime. Come on a Sunday and the place is deserted. The market is quiet on Mondays & Tuesdays. When open, a foodies delight. I especially like the bread sticks from Bread Ahead.||May 11, 2017
Michelle W||50||Borough Market is an explosion of colors, flavors, and aromas. It is the ideal place to eat lunch and take in the sights and sounds of that part of the city. A must visit stop on any trip to London.||May 11, 2017
Shines927||50||Visited this market for lunch one day and was very impressed! There were tons of choices of foods from all over the world. The prices were very reasonable & the food was fantastic! The meats, vegetables and fruits all looked very fresh and there were lots of places to get all kinds of cheese. I would highly recommend a visit here when traveling to London!||May 11, 2017
onepurplepotato||50||Must visit place every time I am in London. Most recommended foods are the oysters and strawberries. You can get a good cup of coffee from Monmouth there too. Good to go in groups so that you can try greater varieties of foods. ||May 11, 2017
221Pietro||50||Borough market is a place where I could spend whole day just sampling different foods and fruits. Absolutely brilliant supply of practically anything one might wish to have in gourmet foods.||May 11, 2017
D8821PSfredb||50||A fantastic range and especially of cheeses, oils and small goods. Many, many fresh food stalls. Recommend ||May 11, 2017
Amir S||50||Wonderful market, colorful, lots of things to see and eat.If you are in London don't miss this.Close to the London Bridge tube station.We started at 10:00 am so it was not crowded, it is more crowded during the weekend.||May 10, 2017
itchfoot||40||It would be easy to lose someone in the crowds. I'm sure it's a pickpocket's haven too since there's no way to avoid bumping into others.It really is more than a market, as in grocery-shopping, although there is fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, fish. There's also cooked food (a lot!) and numerous stalls with jewelry, clothes, etc. You could really spend a lot of time here but with the crowds (business-suited diners included), it would be a long day.Still, it has its own unique vibe and is a fun place to just explore||May 10, 2017
TammyQ||50||This is a must on each and every visit to London! We arrive hungry and explore all of the delicious venders we possibly can! Come early as it can get very crowded!||May 10, 2017
manuelpJ6443DC||40||Great variety of products and food stands, coffee shops, barbershop, flowers ... Fun place to eat and drink something and continue with our visit.||May 10, 2017
SandipBasuMallik||50||Very near to London bridge and can get variety of foods in cheap price . This market is the oldest market in London||May 10, 2017
PadiP||40||Go at the weekend when everyone else is out and the choices are the best. I love the choices of food, bread, meat cheese and vegetables. Choices of cooked food exceptional too. ||May 8, 2017
1roadboss||40||A few local friends suggested I visitBorough and I really enjoyed the experience. Nice variety of stalls with food options from all over. Came here to eat my lunch. The fish and chips was okay . Just not as pleasant to eat fish and chips with one hand cutting the fish. Enjoyed the Colombian native coffee. Very nice atmosphere. ||May 8, 2017
Anthony B||50||Do you like food? Do you like all sorts of delicious comestibles from all over the world? You do? Great! Then Borough Market is the place for you. A bit like an eclectic version of La Boqueria in south London (which no doubt inspired this place) this food lovers haven brims with speciality cuisine ranging from gourmet cheeses, exquisite cold meets, artisan liquors, technicolour veg' and steaming snacks from all corners of the globe. No doubt the monied classes from the local middle class boroughs flock in to get the contents for Saturday night dinner parties across the city looking to impress with high priced, top end ingredients. If I lived in these parts I'd probably do the same.Definitely worth a visit to scoop up a few things you won't get in the big supermarkets and enjoy grazing the many freshly cooked street foods. It's a fantastic, if waist expanding, venue for sybarites from all points of the compass!||May 8, 2017
Patrick_VB01||50||A great little market very close to London Bridge. Lots of stalls selling food, and other items. One great stall to see is a spice shop.||May 8, 2017
324rogerw||40||Visited here and had lunch on the way to the Shard (just a few minutes walk away). Very interesting produce market and many stalls selling a huge range of street food. German, Thai, Ethiopian, Indian, French Bristish are then ones I can remember. Many of the stalls were Gluten free and there was an excellent Gluten Free cake stall! Food was very good and, for London, good value.||May 8, 2017
JHarris_9||50||Went here after visiting the Shard....wow what an amazing selection of eating places and sources for making a great meal. It was buzzing and busy and I pretty much wanted to try everything I saw. This is an old market and so it was really interesting to see. We sampled the chips and I would have liked to have enjoyed more and stayed longer. I will definitely return, and if you visit make sure you're hungry!||May 7, 2017
phillirit||50||Top quality food, you can go pretty early if you want. Restaurants availble, very good quality food friendly people and atmosphere, very enjoyable||May 7, 2017
Carol S||50||Awesome market been on this site since 1765. Plenty of different stalls, food stalls to make your mouth water||May 7, 2017
Dontlikemoaningbut||50||Had a great time wondering around this fantastic market, there are loads of traders with lots of free nibbles to try. Wonderful aromas follow you everywhere you go & you just can't help to try some of the foods available. Great atmosphere & plenty of variety for everyone which of course does make this a very busy place to visit but definitely worth a trip.||May 7, 2017
Richard_J_Hunt||50||Borough market is awesome! Great for lunch - try the Ethiopian/Eritrean beef stew. Even better if you're into cooking and looking for fantastic ingredients. Just don't expect it to be cheap - this is best quality and you have to pay for it. ||May 6, 2017
courtneym509||50||Borough Market was the first market that we experienced while we were in the UK. We couldn't believe the amount of vendors that we're located in the space; however, we never felt like it was too crowded at all. We got lunch here and bought several different items for snacking on later in our trip. Try to get there early; the earlier the better. ||May 6, 2017
rubanoz||40||Really enjoyed wandering around here.. and would recommend coming in the morning before the crowds descend. most places open by 1030.. the boston sausage breakfast was so delicious that i came back a second time a few days later...would highly recommend it..||May 5, 2017
BruceWQ||40||The market has a wide selection of street food. I made the mistake of having a heavy breakfast before coming.However, I still managed to try the award winning fish and chips, which was pretty good.There's a lot of variety, however to say that you must do this when visiting London is debatable. I've seen equally good if not bigger and better markets.Still, as a tourist and you want to know what the hype is all about.. you can pop by. You won't waste your time. ||May 5, 2017
joyburd||40||Borough Market is one of my favorite things about London but for the love of god try to go early or between meals. The place is a nightmare on peak hours.||May 5, 2017
cristalesavila||40||I was surprised by the beaty of the building Borough Market with the high transparent ceiling. The varied and diferent type of food, drinks and another things. The best time to visit is in the early morning or afternoon.||May 4, 2017

gbmDurhamEngland||50||Well worth a visit. First time and if you want a bacon butty go to Maria Cafe. Bacon tasted so nice x girls were lovely and friendly. Lots of street food or shpuld i say market food. ||May 4, 2017
RPRBBR||50||Next to Southwark Cathedral and a "stones throw" from "The Chard," the Borough Market is a must. A great variety of value entrees. One of the best markets in London. A must when you are in the area.||May 4, 2017
independantice||40||We stumbled upon this market in search of street food We had just crossed london bridge and saw sign posts As you cross the bridge it is to the right hand side under the bridgeThere are different stalls on different days A good selection of street food is available and we enjoyed walking all along the stalls at this busy lunch hourMexican, Chinese, Indian and local british pies are available Traditional fish & chips at the fish kitchen , always a que so def worth the waitWe had a heidi veg pie with mash & gravy which was excellent on this blustery day We then wandered around the rest of the market of cheese fruit veg stalls Fresh juice was on sale with tastersMost all the stalls let you taste so we had the cheese, chocolate & some avocado juice with mint A new seating area purpose built to eat your lunch with buskers playing A fine dining restaurant is built into the bridge with a lift for access A lovely market def worth a visit||May 4, 2017
Outbackdad||50||The whole range of high quality food stands from fruit and vegetable stands to meat, poultry, seafood, fish, along with a vast assortment of prepared food and drink offers both comfort food to the exotic.I especially appreciate the wild game. Quite a change here from the old wholesale fruit and vegetable market of twenty years ago. The nearbyNeal's Yard Dairy shop is steps away.||May 3, 2017
Wikipeter1982||50|| Look around and taste the great food. We went to a fresh juice bar that was Nice. We were with friends and shares all the dishes so you can taste more. ||May 3, 2017
SaigonStevo||50||We went to as many markets as we could find. There's a lot ! But this is by far the best in London for amazing raw ingredients, oils and cheeses as well as amazing restaurants and street style dining out the back. ||May 2, 2017
lws07||50||Great place to go for a variety of food stalls combined with an upscale farmers market. I saw options for vegans and vegetarians (most of which was in one corner by the dessert and ethnic options), but meat and cheese eaters will have the most choice of all. Not really any seating areas (except for 3 random, unsturdy benches I came across) but fun with great food options nonetheless.||May 2, 2017
Ally T||40||This is a lively, fun-filled energetic market. There are lots of fabulous stalls with incredible foods and drinks.||May 2, 2017
Adams9745||50||The food here is expensive, but there are some great tasters, and portion sizes are substantial. Lots of cool stalls, my favourite was the cheese one, my wife's, the honey one. You can get a plastic spoon and try all sorts of different honey flavours- we bought a few jars to take home!||May 2, 2017
BeautifulLifeTime||50||We visited family in London and took the Saturday to stroll along the Southbank with their young children. The kids were entertained all the way from Waterloo to Blackfriars. The market was extremely busy, but queues moved quickly. Must haves are the sublime scotch eggs from Scotchtails and the magnificent oysters from Richard Howard's Oyster. Goats milk milkshakes, home brewed ice-tea, prosecco and crisp wines are available throughout the market. Definitely worth the visit. Oh, and don't forget the sensational pulled pork sandwich! ||May 2, 2017
140fionag||30||I made the mistake of coming in too late when things were closing for the evening hence low rating.Will come in earlier on next visit.||May 2, 2017
Tee D||50||This place is amazing! It's a great place to taste and try all kinds of great delights from all over the UK and the world! Visit the cider seller, for sure!! If you're game to try something interesting, there's a vendor who has kangaroo or emu burgers. Lots to see! Be prepared to eat on the run. This place is usually pretty crowded!||May 1, 2017
Anne D||50||Words can't describe the wonderful variety of amazing food items that are available. A must for anyone who enjoys culinary delights and there's something new at each turn to tempt you again. Samples galore so go hungry. Also loved our time at the Chef's Table with Sam and Alberto. We sincerely hope they turn their pop up into something permanent. Check it out.||May 1, 2017
812shivk||50||This market is open to all foodies and wine lovers as the place is always buzzing with good food and loving drinks.. The places like wheatsheaf are always buzzing with people in the evening who just like to experience ales and craft beers.. Also couple of shops below the church have some sumptuous food to cherish||May 1, 2017
Worcester_Sarah||50||We ended a lovely long walk along the South Bank with a visit to the market. I topped up with some fabulous ingredients at Spice Mountain, including some chunks of Hymalian pink salt and grater. I then had a delicious fresh made dhosa at Papi's Pickles, and an interesting lesson in South Indian cooking from the owner. So much to look at and buy in this market. ||May 1, 2017

374jaym||40||I love coming to this place it's a must for all visitors &. The stalls and the quality of foods and wine is amazing. Some of it is not cheep but you get what you pay for. For me every time I can get in I will always go and and get fresh produce. the oyster bar is one for me So for me a great big thumbs up||May 1, 2017
Darryl R||30||Ok for a stop at lunch for some stand-up street food but nothing special. Also some sit down restaurants around it, but no crafts and items to be sold - just food. ||May 1, 2017
omega132857||50||What a great place to see and eat. We love the hustle and bustle of this great place. You can have some really great food here at a good price, with something for everyone. There are some great veggy stalls as well, and stalls that sell a lot more stuff too.||May 1, 2017

funbobbiesocks||50||All the food was amazing! Scottish Egg, Sausage Roll, Mede, Donuts, Fish and Chips, Chocolate Cake and Pudding. We actually went back to the market a few days latter for lunch. The guides were great. It was neat to hear how the food was made. I am going to try to make the Scottish eggs. Probably will not be nearly as good||April 30, 2017
musovince||40||A must visit for any tourist. The food is made fresh and right in front of you, with some places offering free samples. It's expensive but well worth it! Just prepare to go into a food coma.||April 30, 2017
Antwerpgirl_10||50||We had some great fresh oysters and prosecco from a couple of guys who where very friendly. We also went by a lot of stands and could taste some cheeses, sausages, ... It is a fun thing to do!||April 30, 2017
SSSteph||50||This is a popular market for foodies and just a great place to do some people watching. Went there several times and found it busiest during Lunch on Friday and Sunday, but still manageable. Choice of food is amazing and it is close to many other London attractions so would make this a pit stop while exploring the city. Take time to walk around all the streets towards the water front and get a sense of old London. Our first tour here was with the Muggles Tour and were regaled with lots of stories about the history of the area, as well as the many sites where movies were filmed, etc.||April 30, 2017

Gollam76||50||Under the London bridge - a real recommended place to visit ! Enjoy the mood , the real authentic tastes of different nations and the delicious food! Not leave the place, eat in the atrium, listing to the talented street signers as well||April 29, 2017
brenoa31||50||Had a nice time at the market! Tasty food and nice beer at The Rake! Tried the oyster and the venisson burguer!!||April 29, 2017
45kathc||50||Oh my word. If you are a foody of any description, this is an absolute must for you.Situated within walking distance from the Tower of London and the bridge, this is an open air food market that ignites the taste buds and stirs the culinary imagination of anyone with any sense of taste or smell.Fresh food of every possible description is available either to buy to eat or to take home to enjoy.You will find so many treasures here,too many to mention, but if you want to be inspired to try something new, then this is the place for you.I really cannot recommend it highly enough. If you love food, you cannot miss this place.||April 29, 2017
ItsAshleyYoung||40||The market itself, the staff who served me were amazing! How they could keep smiling through the rush is amazing! Very polite to!The food is amazing, the quality, freshness and overall what they had to offer was fantastic! It was something I wanted to experience and grateful I went however the huge huge let down were the tourists! People pushing you with selfie sticks to record a stall (I understand its another culture but please be respectful as I had a young one in a pram), pushing past to get served before you and sticking cameras/phones in everyone's faces I did not enjoy! It felt like I was meant to be in a huge tourist trap! I went Saturday midday so I can not comment if it is any better at other times but Im guessing it would probably be best to go in weekday mornings! It was an experience but I will not be returning sadly.||April 29, 2017
CantSingforToffee||50||Well I have to say this place is fantastic.The best street food I've EVER tasted was AppleBees' Wraps outside Neal's Yard shop on Stoney Street and only £6 for such a generous portion of Mixed Fish & Prawns (costs more from the supermarket for that much fish), if the queue is long I'd still wait... its worth it.The mix of stalls... quality and decoration of each is brilliant. Food & drink stalls from all corners of Europe.Intend to return on every future London visit.Market is closed at night, come during the day only.||April 29, 2017
TheFairClient||50||Try booking a Celia Brooks tour, 3-4 weeks before. As a foreigner, I discovered quickly the most quality suppliers of trusted food.The presentation is basically a brunch, so step your regular breakfast in the morning.We will return there, for the pleasure to see & taste some prefered dishes. Try the sweets like coconut milk with susan seeds, made by Thai Origin cookers.The Spanish hamon offered on varios taste should become your personal experience. The seafood, or vegetarian dishes do not miss from there.||April 29, 2017
439DavidW439||50||The variety of different foods available here is amazing. The three of us all chose a different stall for our impromptu lunch and were all happy. There was also a live cooking demonstration going on, very good. ||April 29, 2017
TheLondonLady21||50||I LOVE this place - great place for a day out. Be warned - all the food is so good so don't go for the first place you see - there is so much there - walk around to see what is available. Most of the prices we came across were very reasonable. Great fresh produce available to take home.Very near London Bridge station. Most of market is covered.||April 29, 2017
fluffymonkey||50||A vibrant market that must be one of the oldest in London with lots of stallholders selling quality produce that they care about, a real foodies heaven, well worth a visit but packed to the rafters on a busy Easter Saturday!||April 28, 2017
DMC90||50||I have tried on 3 occasions to visit this market only to go on the wrong day or it was closed for an event. Finally made it and it really is worth it. Fun, tasty and interesting. The merchants there are passionate about their food and drink and add so much more to any shopping trip. Plan your day to arrive at 10 am and wander the market stalls. Then go back and pick out picnic items and there are lots of tables and public areas to go 'al fresco' at the market.||April 28, 2017
BlankyGiron||50||We were there last Christmas and had breakfast and spent some time just looking all the diferente stands. Safe, clean and with a lot of stuff to try and see. Near tower bridge, London date and the sharpe.||April 28, 2017
Expedition809669||50||Had heard about this place and finally visited. Read reviews which were helpful. It is mostly under cover so ok for a rainy day however if it is cold as was the day we went, I wish I had worn warmer clothes as the wind tends to whistle through a bit. Most of the eating and drinking stalls do not have seating although by the glass entrance where they do food demos there are some nice wooden benches and some people were sitting there. If you want a nice coffee and a sit down I suggest Monmouth Coffee on the corner of Park Street. There is seating and some areas where you can "perch" with a hot drink and pastry. We did find a place for lunch with seating and a heater which was very welcomed. There is also a fish and chip shop with seating but most are take away. There are so many stalls with samples you could have a small lunch on the hoof...dip bread into olive oil...bits of cheese on offer... pasta to name a few and the odd sample of booze! Nearby you could then go to Oblix in the Shard for a drink/cocktail. £14.50 gets you a cocktail and a great view of the city on level 32 without having to pay for the entrance fee to the viewing platform though that is a much higher level and the view is 360. Oblix (smart dress code applies) is reached by going in the entrance that says Restaurants next to the Shangri La hotel. You go through an airport type security then into a lift that automatically takes you to Level 32 for Oblix and Aquashard. It made a nice end to the day.||April 28, 2017
resipsaloquitur||50||Located near the south side of the London Bridge, there is a vast market area with a myriad number of food stalls with a virtual cornucopia of fresh, raw and cooked foods. There's spices for sale, butchered meats, sea foods, dessert vendors, olive and other oils, great fish and chip shops, etc. Definitely worth a visit even if you intend only to observe (but trust me, you'll sample the wares at some point). Really crowded on the weekends. An easy walk from the subway/tube.||April 28, 2017
LeShout||50||A great place of foodies - you can sample so many different foods to eat or take away you could not be disappointed. the market itself is vibrant and busy and even mid-week when there are less stalls there are many small shops that are always there||April 27, 2017
Helen D||50||if you ever have the chance to get this excellent market Take it. With so many stalls offer food from around the world as well as local fare, you'd be crazy to miss it. Should all the great smells, coming from the great range of food stalls make you feel hungry, the indoor Café ( Maria's ) serves the very best in British cuisine. My personnel favourite Sausage and Mash yum ! ||April 27, 2017
TonyfromSolihull||50||I used to work close to the Market but haven't been there for about 9 years. It's really matured and grown in that time. All the stall holders are passionate about their produce and the quality is outstanding. I went on Thursday late morning and the crowds were quite light, but I bet it's a different story on Friday and Saturday. I had a leisurely stroll and sampled some of the wares. I had a lovely brunch at the Market Café and bought some cheese and the best Parma Ham I've ever tasted. Borough Market is a 'must visit' venue. It's the spiritual home of anyone who loves great food.||April 27, 2017
Jamie M||50||Went for Lunch on a Saturday, it was really busy , but buzzing. Lots of produce on show with free samples or the the chance to buy some great fresh produce. Well worth a visit. Not easy finding a place to eat , but we had a great sandwich and a pint at the Wheatsheaf.||April 27, 2017
JusticM||40||If you are foodie or visiting London this should be on your list. A wonderful place to get fresh produce or fill up at some foodie stalls. So many options including ones for people who are gluten free or vegans. Great place to walk around and then take a stroll along the Thames. Perfect afternoon in London.||April 26, 2017
alanog||50||went to the market today after visiting the shard. Lots of great food options and plenty of fresh food,meat,cheese and other produce if interested. The history of the market is obviously way back as much of the infrastructure has been kept. also of interest close by was a attractive church||April 26, 2017
AndyE402||40||Loads of different foods available here, from specialist stalls. We visited on a chilly damp day, so while the hot food was welcome, there were so few eating areas to sit down at, and those there were suffered from dripping rain and chilly winds. A nice atmosphere in a crowded environment, which is part of the attraction, but you'll have to eat on the go, and share the little available space with hundreds of others.||April 26, 2017
LisaR631||50||Visited on a Friday lunchtime. We were spoiled for choice in terms of picking something to eat - every corner of the globe is represented. Eating aside, there is lots to see and gawp over. Great atmosphere.||April 26, 2017
JordanMartinMillar||50||For great food at great prices with a couple of hours of sensory overload look no further than Borough market. Being in London as a student for 6 months, I have come to this spot over 5 times and there is always something new and interesting. For food I highly recommend you check you Bread Ahead Bakery and try one of thier sinful but extremely delightful doughnuts, it is not to be missed.For food, I enjoy Scotch Tail's Scotch Eggs with sweet potatoes fries. Cost about 6 pounds. Good for sharing.Also do check out the fresh oysters and seafood selection. :) Do be warned that the place can get crowded on the weekends. Do try and visit on a weekday. There are also public toilets located in the vicinity which are clean and free to use. After a long food feast, head over to Monmouth Coffee for a great cup of coffee :) hope this review helped! Follow me on Instagram @millarjordanfor more food and travel post :) thanks!||April 25, 2017
Tracey w||50||Visited the market on Saturday with a friend. The choice of food on offer is amazing! Huge selection of stalls serving take away food and drink, specialist producers selling local and international produce from truffles to oysters and PROPER scotch eggs! We bought loads of spices from Spice Mountain- incredible selection, really friendly knowledgeable staff and really good value! Picked up lots of useful tips and information about how to use our new ingredients - Magali you are amazing! Thanks to all at Borough Market for a wonderful day. ||April 25, 2017
Samantha_Carl||50||If you don't go hungry you'll regret it! There is so much to try here and everything smells and looks so good, there really is something for everyone and I love how you can literally start in Mexico, snack in Thailand and drink in Italy whilst covering the globe in-between. It is busy but everyone is polite and whilst you're slowly working your way around you get see everything being freshly cooked and prepared. There is lots of amazing produce to buy to take home too. It has a great bustling atmosphere and is very walkable.||April 25, 2017
Londonpete17||30||I went there on a weekend worst thing i did it was so crowded You cannot get to the stalls . The food is not mass produced so good but it was just the wait and watch you money .May get picked i contected the police and they did nothing||April 25, 2017
goldys||40||A nice market with a wide range of street food options to eat on the spot or take with you. Grab something to eat and then have a cup of freshly ground coffee with a delicious piece of cheese cake. Mouthwatering! ||April 25, 2017
wendy p||50||We always have to have a wander around this market the atmosphere is great all the different kinds of food to try the smell is amazing .We managed to try oysters for the first time ,truffle pate,and lots of food from all over the world .It gets very very crowded so it's best to go early but it's a great place to have lunch too.||April 24, 2017
Roger B||50||Food and drink explosion! To really enjoy, you may need a whole day. The atmosphere, the crowd, the stalls/shops... definitely a must when in London!||April 24, 2017
Addy C||40||My co-workers told us this is one of the best and most amazing food markets. However it was closed when we visited due to the funeral services for the PC killed in the Westminister terrorism incident. Borough Market is also closed Sundays. FYI Borough Market is located very close to the London Bridge tube station.||April 23, 2017
K5840YJrogerp||50||The range of stalls in this market is amazing. Wine and beers, diver caught shellfish, cheese. The list goes on. A mix of locals doing their shopping and tourists enjoying the experience. This is a truly not to miss market. ||April 23, 2017
Stephanie0988||50||Tons of food stalls here, lots to choose from. Perfect for a snack while walking all over London. You can also grab a beer or a Pimm's and walk around.||April 23, 2017
Mr and Mrs M||50||Borough market had a lot of food varieties. From fruits, cheeses, desserts, wraps, burgers, rice meals and a whole lot more. The market was big enough to explore. Everything we tasted were amazing! 100% satisfied with our visit. Definitely a must go to place when travelling to London.||April 23, 2017
Andrei C||50||Before going here I heard a lot of recommendations from a lot of friends about this place. I can say that I had quite high expectations before reaching the market but wow!, all was true and then some. So just to give a short description of the place. It is an open door market, located just under the London Bridge. Many fancy looking carts were tempting us to try some of the food freshly prepared right over there, or to buy fruits, vegetables or meat, fish and other sea food specialties. I had a paella (British stile one with chorizo) that was very good, and also tried some coffee served from one of the many charts there. Must say that it was close to the Italian coffee served in Italy, a real ristretto. Even though we were recommended to also try this place for breakfast, in my opinion this is not the right place for that. The food that you find here would be better for lunch or dinner if you ask me as it is a bit heavier. This is a must visit if you have some time to stroll around the city without a special purpose. ||April 22, 2017
Thomas V||50||This market is heaven for all foodies. All sorts of food products, plus fresh produce, in beautiful displays with friendly workers who offer lots of free samples. I've been to lots of markets around the world and this is one of the best. Good place for lunch.||April 22, 2017
CoriCarrotte||40||Great variety of food stalls. Diverse range of ethnic cuisine on offer. Go hungry. Good prices too. Try the bakery stall for some delicious doughnuts.||April 22, 2017
Richard M||40||We visited during the week on a Thursday and so had 3 hours to look around and taste the food market of global variations. Really enjoyed our day out and thoroughly recommend this market. A wide range and exotic foods to eat or to take food home. Wish we had been more adventurous in our food selections so better luck next time.||April 22, 2017
SeaHawk14||30||Ok, not sure what all the hype is about?? Do not get me wrong, there is an assortment of many types of food in a small place however, there did not seem to be anything that looked beyond high end carnival food with a few exceptions.||April 21, 2017
Studentenblume||50||We were there after visiting the Tate Modern. These two places are very close to each other, so it's a good idea to combine them.There's an awesome variety of really good, fresh food. I had some handmade wild boar tortellini (very delicious!) and my friend a vegan burger. Even if you're on a special diet, you've got good chances to find something you like for a good price at Borough Market. At most of the stalls there're also free samples to taste :-)||April 21, 2017
MoReber||50||If you love food - this is a must!!!! Wow, anything you can imagine and please try the scotch egg!! beautiful dish - wonderful market - right under the shard! ||April 21, 2017
John W||40||If you are looking for fresh food products of almost type, this is the place to go. I would particularly recommend going there are lunchtime, when not only can you buy fresh food products you are looking for, there are lots of places to buy cooked food to eat. So many different choices....The fresh fish and seafood is particularly impressive. Wild / line caught fish, plus diver gathered shell fish, which is usually difficult to get.||April 21, 2017
RuiMei||30||Visited it during a full market. While there are many stalls selling different food, fruits and drinks, I did not particularly find them value for money. Won't be a must visit for me the next trip.||April 20, 2017
Geoff L||50||My daughter and I visited the market the other day and really enjoyed the pre lunch time rush....got there about 11 am and managed to meander around the stalls before making a decision on lunch from such a variety of foods. Also most of the stalls had samples of their wares......I must say this made the decision very difficult. I always have cockles as a taster then find something more substantial to eat. The fish and chip store is always a good call but the pulled pork rolls at the entrance from the church side was a winner. We found a space in the sun and enjoyed our lunch.One thing that I thought was a bit irritating are the school children who just sit in groups in the path ways between the stalls . Maybe a communal seating area would be a good idea.Well worth a visit when in London ||April 20, 2017
429anjelical||50||Every time i visit London, i always stop by Borough Market. It's one of my favorite places. It's a huge food market with all types of food from meats, cheeses, fresh produce, desserts, etc. It also has stalls that serve delicious cooked food like paella, kebabs, burgers and more. You can also sample lots of food while walking around. I got to try goat's milk ice cream, which was incredible. The surrounding area is fun and busy as well. Lots of bars, restaurants and shops keep the market and the area lively. Absolutely recommend stopping here. It does get crowded so might be best to avoid a Saturday.||April 20, 2017
berry135||50||I had some seriously yummy food here. The Malaysian chicken curry was awesome and OMG the free samples in the greek shop. It was a life changing experience. Never had that much olive oil in my life and I regret nothing. I looove the diversity of the food here. ||April 20, 2017
G3879NTdebbiet||50||We found this place whilst taking a walk about and loved the bustling atmosphere!Lots of stalls selling fruit, take away food, honey, cheeses, breads .... you can also taste a lot of the fare before buying.Big queues for some of the food stalls however they seemed to go down quickly.Would definitely recommend a visit if near London Bridge!||April 19, 2017
AnnaP3413||50||Market serves all kinds of local and exotic foods. Good place to try it all. A lot of visitors, good food, best breakfast ever. ||April 19, 2017
75douglasf||50||This is a place of hustle bustle and delicious flavours. So much choice of food. No frills just good fresh food we ate on a curb and tried as much as we could. Brilliant atmosphere and a unique experience. ||April 19, 2017
gerleg12||30||This place was so packed with people on a weekday mid-day that we could hardly move. If you hate crowded places avoid here. There is a humungous variety of food here though. An open air market with tons of booths.||April 18, 2017
kelvinf151||50||Great selection of stalls selling a vast range of food and drink. There's a wonderful stall opposite Roast which sells a huge selection of craft beers. A visit here is a must.||April 18, 2017
1Pengy||50||Visited on a busy Saturday (on purpose) and loved the variety of fresh food being made. Tried new foods and loved the whole vibe and energy of the place. If we lived in London we could have even bought fresh food to prepare at home. It had a lot to offer. Prices on some foods were fair, others we wouldn't pay, but like anything or anywhere, you chose. Crazy busy, but remain focused and enjoy the atmosphere!||April 18, 2017
stephenf454||40||Brilliant place for food and wine. Shame it is not open on Sunday though.. Really worth a visit as it is also in a great location for sightseeing ||April 18, 2017
Victor H||50||If you miss Borough Market during your stay in London, you missed one of the most authentic places in this city. A short walk around the area with tasty "take out" food will make your day. Leave out some other sight seeing spots and go to Borough Market instead.||April 18, 2017
Mark F||50||Anyone who likes food will love this place ! A gem of a find. Champagne and calamari. Scallops to die for or all sorts of meat and cheese. Great food, great value for the quality. Had better service here than places 5 times the price in London. ||April 17, 2017
A K||40||Great selection of stalls- from olive oil, to oysters and cheese. Restaurants surrounding the market are excellent as well and serve a variety of tastes. Less than two minute walk from London Bridge.||April 17, 2017
dsmoore||50||What a great food Market. Fresh fish, oysters, vegetables, bread, meat, spices. Experience the food sounds sights and smells of a great London food Market ||April 17, 2017
Sandygranny||50||We have just had another great experience in Borough Market. They offer a variety of exotic, fresh food and their prices are reasonable.There are plenty of free samples on offer and even if you don't like all the food, it is still fun to stroll through!Once again, we bought some lovely fresh bread from the baker’s stall to take home and some cheese from one of the other stalls.||April 17, 2017
Sonia M||50||Food of all sorts, you will be spoilt for choice. It was absolutely packed when we went (Easter weekend at a lunchtime). Salt beef was amazing. Cakes and sweet treats looked extremely tempting! Great atmosphere, can't believe we have walked by it before and not gone in.||April 17, 2017
EvelynHamilton_NJ||50||Check the schedule for when the market is open to get the full picture of this place. Lots of free samples. ||April 17, 2017
ttiiamaria||50||We went here during our trip almost every morning for breakfast. A variety of ethnic foods, fresh foods, coffees, cheeses, spices, etc. A lot of local people, also a popular cafe Monmouth is located here. Easy to arrive by bus or metro. I highly recommend a visit here.||April 17, 2017
AmitabhGupta||50||Its a market with fresh produce and such things. But you will be confused what to eat and what not to. If you are into fresh/ local/ artisanal produce... you must visit here. It has a mix of everything. Cheese, cold cuts, bread/ bakery, fruits/ juices, the most amazing fish n chips and so on. You must try Bread Ahead (right at one of the entrances). This place is not cheap... but still top notch.||April 17, 2017
Karen B||40||On the strength that this was no.17 of top things to do in London (out of 1,581 on TripAdvisor) and we'd never been to the market before, thought it had to be worth a punt - we weren't disappointed. We went hungry, which is definitely a good idea ... my brunch consisted of a strange but rather nice mix of an almond croissant, bread pudding and a vegetable dosa! The vegetable dosa was delicious, I just wish I'd had more room to keep sampling and eating! There were some unusual stalls - a vegan burger bar, goat's milk ice-cream and wheatgrass drinks - all of which I would have liked to have tried but I was far too full ... I shouldn't have eaten those cakes darn it! Didn't come away empty handed - we brought home some mushroom pate - which sounds boring but it was amazing, even my daughter who doesn't like mushrooms loved it! It was called Pate Moi. It's run out now which is sad and I don't think it's available to purchase online. Didn't realise, till we left, that there was actually somewhere to sit and eat your food (to the far right of the market there is a covered seating area) so that was a bit of a fail but never mind. You can also go behind the stalls, near the church and lean on the wall to get away from the crowds for a bit to munch on your food.||April 17, 2017
HerbertC249||40||Absolutely colorful market, both in the literal sense as well as the variety of the food available. The aroma tingling your senses as you amble through the market is intoxicating in a good way! Forget the restaurants.... this place could be your unforgettable lunch place by just sampling a little bit of the many food stalls.||April 16, 2017
Theatrefan2017||50||Stumbled across this market making our way along South Bank. A very lively and vibrant place, we might have eaten a bit too much and drank loads of coffee. Vocalists scattered around provided plenty of entertainment. Will go back||April 16, 2017
debbiedel826||50||A smaller market but don't miss it, try Pie Minister & a PimmsNot as ceRow dead as Camden .Market if you prefer a more chill atmosphere ||April 16, 2017
JMichelCM||50||Greate smells, colors and tastings! This is the best food market in London. It has a great atmosphere below the old bridges. You can taste cheese and some other things on the stands. You ll find handmade toffees in several tastes, lot of warm food (burgers, indian food, fresh bread, seafood and oysters, pulled pork and and and) and a lot of things to taste. Its really very nice and has so many things to see. Its really great and you should go there for at least 2 hours. If it would be possible we would have taken a lot of things with us. Next time in London we ll go there again, thats for sure.||April 16, 2017
OnAir75263||50||Had a great time exploring the markets. So many food stalls to choose from. I had the Paella for lunch which was fantastic. And great coffee and wine bars opposite.||April 16, 2017
Isai2034||50||It's a faboulous market where you can found a large type of food, that you can taste. You can find all kind of smells and flavours||April 15, 2017
ONeill71||50||A trip to London is not complete without a visit to Borough Market. I love the buzz and vibe of this place, the excitement of finding foods from other countries and speciality and artisan producers. The fruit and veg stalls alone always amaze me with the variety and quality of the produce. If I lived near a Borough Market I would never be away from it and my cooking would be far more inspired than it probably is now! If you are a foodie then yes u have to visit Borough but beware it does get incredibly busy.||April 15, 2017
WanderlustRuth||40||A lot of vegan/vegetarian food and also fresh ingredients such as fruits, spices, vegetables etc. Pretty crowded and busy. We went at the weekend, and there was a lot of ethnic food available.||April 15, 2017
poppitshelby||50||Wow, what a choice for a food feast. Everything from pancakes to Jamaican Jerk, something for every taste!The atmosphere is amazing, proper street food at its best with a fun, friendly vibe. We visited on a cold December day and chose fresh prawns and pulled pork from different stores - both were delicious and the prices are great.A must visit place for lunch in London.||April 15, 2017
visitor150811||50||If you love food this is the place to go! Fruit and veg. Meat and fish. Bread and cheese. And loads of food stalls in a wonderful building. It does get busy and shop around for best prices.||April 15, 2017
alexachim||50||Been here while on a stroll on the keys. Crowded place but really friendly and youthfull. So if you want to get a taste of London's varied food culture, you can grab a quick snack here. Avoid the lunch hours.||April 15, 2017
RAS73Leeds||50||I have wanted to go to Borough Market for years when in London and always missed out. The whole area is a foodies heaven and a feast for the eye and nose. Go for brunch or lunch or to get amazing cheese, fruit, bread or wine. The whole area around the market is worth a visit with small shops especially if you are at the Globe (another place thats well worth a visit).||April 15, 2017
olaj484||50||Best to go first thing avoid the crowds wide choice it helps yo be focused not cheap but a real treat ||April 14, 2017
archmage||50||Tons of food choices! Chorizo in a bun. Duck confit. Ethiopian food. Fish & chips. Hot dogs. Paella. Prawn & fish Cajun wrap. Burgers. You have way more choices than appetite. Great for buying fresh cheeses. Recommend the 36 month old Comte as well as the Gouda. The Alpine Honey is in rare supply too. Must come here hungry and be prepared to sample!||April 14, 2017
banananna4||50||This market was great! We bought fantastic cheese, olives, and lots of fudge. The street foo smelled amazing, and we had oysters which were some of the tastiest we've ever had. ||April 14, 2017
728rajd||50||This is an amazing market next to London Bridge tube station. There are hundreds of food stalls, selling ready to eat meals and specialty foods. There are many International stalls, I noticed Thai, Ethiopian, Indian, Middle Eastern, German, Spanish etc. There were stalls specializing in Cheeses, Game meat, deserts, tea etc. I tried the Pad Thai and The Bratwurst. My wife thought the Paella was great. The market, the ambience and the food was incredible. Some of the lines at the stalls can be long but this place is a gem,||April 14, 2017
katiepoxson||50||We often visit Borough market for lunch when in London - we love the variety of foods on offer and the element of surprise of not always knowing what will be there!It is always very busy so expect to queue for your food (once you have made the difficult decision of what to buy!)On my last visit, I was with my two 8 year old nieces and I think they found it a bit busy and overwhelming, so something to consider if you are visiting with children. ||April 13, 2017

jredgers||50||Loved the walk along the river to get there, loved the variety of food stalls and the diversity and quality of options. Bought some great cheese, olive oil and sausages! Will be back.||April 13, 2017
Jorma J||50||Always lively early market with lot to see.Even the pub is open early!Morning coffee with lots of sweet eats and chocolate.Later You can have some spiced olives cheese panini...Anything You can imagine...Top!||April 13, 2017
hcharlotteec||50||Borough market has to be one of my favourite places to go in London- with all kinds of food stores (most of which offer tasters) you will find meats, cheeses, fish, bread, fruit and vegetables a plenty! This is a great place just to go for a wander and take in the amazing array of ingredients. Lovely place to shop for ingredients if you are a local (all be it pricey) and for the tourists maybe take home some olives or cheese! I recently visited London and picked up some olives, bread and cheese to eat on the journey home! Any foodie will enjoy the visit! ||April 12, 2017
noimnotsingle||40||Loved the choice of food stalls here , great prices too , something for everyone , would be nice ifthere was somewher to sit tho , people everywhere standing about eating.||April 12, 2017
Goomba81||50||Good place to try the different street food of London. The scotch eggs, fish & chips and goat milk ice cream were good. The pork crackling burger was just decent. Had the cheapest ever sea urchin too - 4 for 10 pounds (though we were not sure if we got this price only because the couple in front of us ordered wrongly and the shop offered it to us cheaper). If not, the normal price is 1 for 3 pounds - which is still very cheap for sea urchin. The sea urchin was not the best we had, though it tasted quite fresh.||April 12, 2017
Girlinacity||50||You will be spoilt for choice when you enter Borough Market. The Japanese gyoza is insanely delicious, the Indian vegetarian dosa is beautifully fragrant and the German Bratwurst is everything you could need if you had a few too many beers the night before. The market is packed with visitors from open until close as they mill around the various market stalls also offering homemade and organic cakes, breads, chocolate and cheeses. The smell of smoke steaming off the BBQs is intoxicating and you could definitely spend a few hours here sampling the different foods and enjoying sangria at the stall where they sell fresh paella each day. There are so many stalls offering too much to mention but an afternoon spent here is a must and you will not be disappointed. Just remember to go on an empty stomach! ||April 12, 2017
Ian N||40||Having been told by numerous people about this place we decided to come on a Saturday Morning. Unbelievable place, cheese lovers delight we sampled many, but there where many other foods to buy from fish, meat, vegetables and breads to wine and beers. Also go hungry cause plenty of different foods available to munch on whilst you are there.||April 12, 2017
TheBrownHat||50||Go on Saturday morning when you can sample great food and drink from all over the world as well as buying great produce. Fantastic range, beautifully presented (we are catching up with the French) and everyone seems to chat.It was a sunny day which no doubt added to the pleasure.||April 12, 2017
trophy_23||50||This spot was recommended to us, so made a stop in here on our south bank walk from Tower Bridge back to our hotel near Westminster. This was the perfect spot to find lunch. We spent a few hours here walking around tasting snacks at various food stands and viewing all the fresh produce and cheeses. If we had more time we would have come back to try more food stands. This is a must see/taste!||April 12, 2017
707janej||50||Great for a morning visit or at lunchtime. Don't eat before you visit and bring your camera to photo all the interesting variety of foods. We were amazed at the variety of meat, fish, vegetables and preserved food, all top quality and mouthwatering. I bought some gluten free cake from a stall selling gluten free baked food but would have bought lots of produce if we hadn't have been staying in a hotel and not needed fresh food. Would love a return visit near Christmas to buy some foodie gifts.||April 12, 2017
JimLel||50||great just walking around and smelling and sampling the range of food. went as a family of 4 and we were able to eat something different. we definitely go back when in London next||April 12, 2017
Shawn7295||50||We went to Borough Market because my wife's friend it had the best grilled cheese sandwich ever. We went on a Saturday. It was really crowded but that was to be expected. It took a while to find the grilled cheese sandwich stand. It was a really good perfectly cooked sandwich. There were tons of different food stands with all kinds of different ethnic foods, desserts, etc. I definitely recommend it if you want to find some really good food at very reasonable prices.||April 11, 2017
joseph_h_11_11||50||This is a very large market that was a short underground trip from our hotel. The selection of cheeses was outstanding, The bakery selection wonderful. There are many places to eat but we chose to get a loaf of bread & a hunk of cheese from the stalls to picnic it. Good choice!! Followed up with a cup of Turkish coffee (sweet) and a nice piece of dark chocolate from another stall.||April 11, 2017
ilovehaagendazs||50||I went on Saturday morning where it wasn't that crowded. Most of the stalls are operating and food is great! There are many choices from raw to cooked food. Make sure you check out their opening hours since this market is not available on Sunday. ||April 11, 2017
claand1968||50||A friend told us that Borough Market was a most do when visiting London so we went there and was really surprised by the size and wide spread assortment of all kinds of food under the roofs of Borough Market. We were there several hours and sampled a lot before we bought several different breads, cheese, cakes and warm dishes to share. You can get your food there all day. Wonderful.||April 11, 2017
TheSmugVegan||50||This market has many stalls, with at least a handful that will satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. The dosa, Indian, Ethiopian, and pies were all great. If getting Ethiopian be sure to ask the proprietor to wash his/her hand or request that they put on gloves before touching your food. This stall lacks consideration, thought, or brains. (Though this is just my single data point, maybe others have had better luck or don't care.)I did not experience similar problems with other vendors. Don't waste your time with the fruit and veg. vendor called "Turnips" they are over priced and don't know the provenance of their produce. You can find others that sell local or organic items for similar prices. ||April 11, 2017
jordanbM4817BK||50||After going to the market, I was ready to move to London. It is such a fun place to visit! We went on a weekday and a weekend. There were much more people on the weekend. But the vast array of food is memorizing. African, German, Thai, Spanish (to name a few). I could have spent all day there tasting everything. Make sure to get a donut!||April 11, 2017
Leighl3||50||We came across Borough Market and wandered through delighting in the fabulous smells of every variety of food you can imagine. We stopped to enjoy a glass of sangria in the sunshine and ended up staying for a meal of meat mezze, which was superb.||April 11, 2017
N4624SAnancys||50||We were sent to this market by our daughter who studied in London for a summer. We were amazed! She told us to go hungry and we did! The grilled cheese was epic! The cooked to eat food, the sweets, the vegetables, the cheese the whole feel was a wonderful experience. We had wine outside of the wine shop and just watched the people go by. We had a wonderful experience and would recommend at lunch time for everyone!||April 11, 2017
Richtea1000||50||Definitely worth a visit and a photograph opportunity.. next door to Southwark Cathedral and around the corner from the Globe..a nice place to spend the afternoon||April 11, 2017
gmbklm||50||Despite the tourists & hot takeaway food, Borough Market still has some great fresh produce stalls - we shop nearly every week - our favourites include fantastic fresh fish from Sussex Fish (with his own boat in Seaford, Paul's Plaice), Wyndham House for wonderful poultry and game, Furness for great venison & game, Ginger Pig butchers, Oliviers bread and Chegworth Farm grown soft fruits & veg. Plus lots of lovely cheese and cured meat.The market is being slowly killed by tourists and the demand for easy to buy (and high margin) hot takeaway food. Sadly, the Borough Market management almost seem to discourage fresh produce buyers. Like local authorities managing our High streets, they haven't yet worked out that customers are essential for the produce vendors. Avoid 12-2 mid-week, and go early (ie 8-9am) on a Saturday to avoid the worst of the crowds. Very good nearby alternatives for fresh produce markets are the every Saturday 9am-2pm Spa Terminus (Nathan's The Butchery, England Preserves, Mons & Neals Yard cheese, bread, Monmouth Coffee) + the every Sunday morning market off Marylebone High Street (in front of the Ginger Pig shop). Very sadly, too many people now seem to think the food experience is all about the photo rather than buying, cooking and eating high quality produce !? I guess its all about the illusion of looking sophisticated on your Facebook page.||April 11, 2017
Neil-KAAG||50||Fantastic place to get anything "FRESH" From cheese to fish and meat to the best selection of fresh bread I have ever seen. Well worth a visit even if just to browse.||April 11, 2017
Fitnessworldexplorer||50||An amazing market packed with vendors selling foods from all over the world.It was extremely popular the day we visited on a Saturday morning, but still plenty of space to move around and explore, there is such a massive variety of thing to see and taste.This market is a must for everyone traveling to London.It's located right under the London Bridge, we travelled by bus and found it easily, many others were heading in that direction. I would highly recommend taking a couple of hours exploring and tasting what the market vendors have to offer if you havn't been before.We sampled a variety of sliced up apples, some fudge and cheeses.Macaroni cheese and Mulled wine warmed us up on a chilly day!It was all freshly made and produced. An absolute must, cannot recommend enough, take a nice long walk along the south bank after you have explored the market.Very popular, the website has all the info and it was very useful for us when we were planning our trip.If i lived in London I would be a frequent visitor to Borough Market, its awesome.||April 11, 2017
TheRedTraveller64||50||its a great day walking around the old market and seeing a vast array of stalls selling their wares at a very reasonable price. Everything from fresh meat to oysters ( you have to give them a go) is available as well as food stalls from all around the globe. It is a wonderful experience that, once tried, you will be hooked for more.||April 11, 2017
pbh73||30||Borough Market is an institution, with some excellent vendors and produce. However, at 2pm on a Friday, when my kids wanted some food after visiting the nearby Tate Modern, this was on reflection a poor choice. With every square inch of space taken up by tourists and local office workers enjoying a sunny Friday afternoon, it was overwhelming for my youngest and just plain unpleasant for the rest of us as people pushed and shoved. I understand it is much quieter on Sundays. ||April 11, 2017
Tixby||50||To think that less than 15 years ago they were talking of tearing this place down! Now it's not just a bustling market that sells an eclectic range of products from a wide range of countries, but there's a great vibe too. Lots of coffee bars, pubs and restaurants nearby to suit everyone's taste, all wrapped up next to one of London's most historic quarters recently given an amazing make over. Don't miss it ||April 10, 2017
979hamishr||50||The setting for the market is pretty cool, tucked away under a railway bridge, giving it an interesting feeling. The stalls are amazing, so may options, so many varieties, so much mouth watering deliciousness! It is pretty busy and chaotic, but in the way a market should be and it doesn't feel like too much. Can definitely recommend a visit if you are in the area. ||April 10, 2017
holiday_sunEssex||40||Great market, there seems to be hidden gems around every corner.It's verrry busy, the hustle and bustle isn't for everyone but it's definitely worth a look. Bread, cakes, doughnuts a plenty! Will be going again!!||April 10, 2017
Andre R||50||Really good place to go for food! Typical street food market with lot of option and excellent value and quality!||April 10, 2017
BryanN84||40||Overflowed with tourists but if you can handle that, you will enjoy it. The variety of food is soo spread and almost all the food taste really good. You can really see and taste that all the food is prepared with love and good products. Almost every stall. Prices for food and drinks are a little higher than normal but worth it. ||April 10, 2017
ScarletAndPeach||50||It was such a delight to stumble across the markets while walking near borough station. We visited on a Saturday morning when the markets were in full swing. There were an overwhelming variety of warm food and some good coffee. The market is closed on Sundays and has limited stalls early in the week.||April 10, 2017
jasontillt||40||Regular trip to London and always come here for food... always amazing to look around and try the vast array of different things and different ideas for food ideas from all countries...||April 10, 2017
Paul B||50||Visitors to the UK might find it hard to believe that a market like this exists. European cities are often renowned for their markets: indeed, life often centres around them. Well, here in a corner of this green and pleasant land, just inland from the Thames, is our very own show-piece market. Every corner of the market is crammed with the most glorious food. It pours from groaning stalls, inviting you to gawp, taste, photograph (if you must), discuss. Here is food from far-flung corners of our nation and indeed the world. The cooked food stalls probably represent the whole world's diverse cuisines with the possible exception of fermented whale meat. Standing amongst all of this, drinking in the view, wondering what to eat next, is an unmissable London experience. It's a place to settle into, grab a snack, watch the people, buy something you'd never think of (in our case, rare Vietnamese pepper - it could be a truffle, or wine-bathed cheese, artisan ham, olive oil, honey, a Scottish lobster...). London is so much more than architecture, double-decker busses and black cabs. Real life happens here, and here you will learn about our great nation.Yum.||April 10, 2017
ChantalM1987||40||Its a big market close to the tower bridge, with lots of food to choose from. There are all sorts of food stands, where you can get a complete meal, but there are also stands where you buy fish, vegetables, pies etc. Unfortunately it can be extremely busy.||April 10, 2017
NickandShe||40||Called in to the market on the way to the Tower of London. Great atmosphere, very busy fantastic aromas. I had Caribbean food - lovely tasty food and not too expensive. ||April 9, 2017
Caliope H||50||I live near this market, so every other Saturday (closed on Sunday's) I seemed to end up in it. Because everything in it is open on Saturday's (not so during the week - where it normally caters to restaurants in the early AM) - Saturday's, particularly on a nice day, bring the hoards. So, thought I'd just offer some of the best of it to me: (Tips: Don't start where the rest do.Like most grocery stores the best is at the back. So, instead of starting with one of the main entrances along High Street that lead you pretty much into the street food that's open most days of the week... go down Stoney Street to Monmouth the coffee shop and enter across from i instead. Then work your way back to Main Street. . This row gets almost impassible as the day goes on - so the earlier the better. Many stores don't accept credit for small purchases - bring cash. )- Try and buy your favorite oils, vinegars, cheeses, mustards, and jamon: Olive Oil & Company let's you taste a large variety of olive oils and balsamic vinegars with suggestions on how to use them to let you decide for yourself if the pricey bottles are better (they are), over at Brindisia try out different jamon cut from the leg, around the lane you can test drive more than a dozen flavors of mustard. Once your in the cheese section - sample many before buying. - Play the guessing game at Turnips the vegetable store: Before you read the sign do you know what that veggie is? Or what to do with it?- Prosecco and Oysters next to the fish market Grab them and take them back Stoney Street to find a place to enjoy them.- Discover unusual spices to inspire you: Spice Mountain offers hundreds of dried and exotic spices (yuzu peel, tom yum powder or the world's hottest chili powder anyone?) - Make a picnic and head to the park by Tower Bridge- Eat in a restaurant instead: Stoney Street is lined with great restaurant choices - Visit the pub( "The Globe") that Bridget Jones lived above- Write on the "Before I die..." chalk board between the two parts of the marketI could go on --- but, the above tell you why I rated it 5-stars, and keep revisiting||April 9, 2017
JIMS2851||50||A great place to wander around sampling quality merchandise before you decide on what takes your fancy!All tastes are quite literally catered for....., for the record, I opted for a pulled pork and rocket ciabatta.(The gyozas were a close second)||April 9, 2017
Jimvin||40||You go for the experience but the things on offer to buy are quite expensive on the whole. If the exchange rate is in your favour then maybe do some shopping. It's a place that you may like to mooch about and grab a snack, as there are plenty of fast food stalls :) (not in its worst sense) offering pies, paellas, wraps etc.||April 8, 2017
littlefreddie||50||If you like food Borough Market is a must. Great place to visit. It was lovely to walk around and smell food cooking. There was a lot of unusual food there. ||April 8, 2017
timdouglas16||50||We came here to spend some time after going to the Shard for Brunch, and found a lively, vibrant market with amazing smells, food & atmosphere.We bought artisan cheeses and could have had enough free samples that would have rendered our meal redundant! This was followed up by a walk along the Thames to Tower Bridge.Well worth the visit.||April 8, 2017
luvroma2||50||We went on a Friday and it was not nearly as busy as it usually is on a Saturday. Nevertheless, the food stalls and food stands had lots of patrons but it was a good day to visit since the lines were not as long. The quality of the goods on offer here is incredible. It is one of our favorite places to visit when we are in London - highly recommended.||April 8, 2017
Claire T||50||Great busy vibe, definitely a must in london. Try all the finger food and check out Bridget Jones' house under the bridge. ||April 8, 2017
paperstarfish||50||Due to my flights being delayed in the U.S., I arrived at the market close to 4:30 on a Saturday. I expected it to be picked over and sad by this time, but it was super crowded and the vendors were still sampling lots of goodies and yelling about fresh strawberries, oysters, etc. I got two gluten free treats at Free From Bakehouse. The raspberry, white chocolate brownie was excellent and the cheddar chive scone was okay. Lot of flowers, teas, fruit and veg, olives, honey, meats and cheeses for sale.||April 8, 2017
Perrycj||40||Been here a couple of times and every time it has never disappointed me, the different types of food, drinks, things to look at will amazes you. It's a must see if your In London ||April 8, 2017

545AnnA||50||A short walk from Shakespeare's Globe and the Golden Hind is the national treasure that is Borough Market. If you can eat it, they sell it here. I'm not even going to try to list everything, and you'll need comfortable footwear if you want to see it all. Borough Market is busy, bustling, brimming with tantalising sights and smells, London at its brilliant, vibrant best. Can't wait to go back. ||April 7, 2017
JCJOHNCONNOR||50||A cracking day spent enjoying goods from around the world. All stall holders happy for you to sample before you buy. Amazing food came away with bags full of lovely produce.||April 7, 2017

Anwen62||40||Food should really be of this quality. After being on business the previous day,I had taken the day off to visit. I had breakfast here of black pudding scotch egg from one of the stalls,followed by a wonderful coffee from Monmouth coffee company. I was conscious I needed to pace myself!! I bought some warm breadsticks,followed by a brilliant Comte cheese and fantastic British salami.I then moved one to The freshest Rock oysters with a glass of fizz,oh heaven. I then noticed on the fish stall a sea urchin,bit overpriced but I had never tried one so went for it. I can only describe it as tasting a little like the roe of the scallop.Oh before I left I just had to try the most fantastic looking vanilla doughnut ,not a huge fan but this was wonderful. I loved the place... I need another visit to try the rest of the food. A must for food lovers||April 6, 2017
richmou||40||Always busy on Saturday great street food lovely food stalls go to place when we have friends visiting from outside of town ||April 6, 2017
Annie M||50||Had a great morning at Borough market. We went on a Wednesday so it was not packed. Busy and bustling and interesting. The range of produce was terrific. We enjoyed it all. Had lunch which ended a great morning.||April 6, 2017
461agah||40||Everyone knows the Bourough Market, so that it get crowded in here. A lot of tourists take a look here. The stalls are international. You find indian, german, thai, italian etc food. A lot of cheese and food to go. I really enjoyed it here and wish, they would be open on Sunday so that I could try a lot of more food here. Everything lokked and smelled soooo good. Try the italian sandwiches at Gastronomica||April 6, 2017
St3v3B||50||I was early for a meeting at the Shard so walked in. I love this market. It was lunchtime so I called in at the pie shop - being a northerner. Pie, peas and gravy. Delicious. And there are so many other concessions to browse and enjoy too. A must visit if you are near the area. ||April 5, 2017
Christina T||40||Lots of stall promoting cheese from different countries and parts of UK.If you are looking for an induction session, go during week-ends all stalls aggressively promotes their product by putting out samples.We went on a Week-day and most stall holders were not putting out their products for sampling, suppose it's marketing days for locals, hence no samples are required. Oh, we had also done a week- end visit which is more vibrant but mainly visitors.If you are interested in the local scene, go week-days.If you are keen to sample and be among the tourists, go week-ends.All in all, a decent place for finer food.Don't miss this, worthy of at least 1 visit. We'd visited every time we're there (and we bought some food stuff home too).||April 5, 2017
hahabye||50||This market is a charming and wonderful place to stroll around for a delicious bite to eat while visiting London. I highly recommend you visit!||April 4, 2017
WSWe||50||What a wonderful place. Booth after booth of every imaginable food item. Some are suppliers and some are things that are prepared to eat. Between the breads, cheeses, fish, spices, wine, meats, etc....you have everything you need. But go hungry as you will want to sample everything!||April 4, 2017
Travelingbug29||50||We literally ate our way through the market. Everything was amazing. Get there early though. We were there around closing time.||April 4, 2017
Kelvin E||50||Visited on a Thursday and so much better than the weekends. Although still busy it was nice to be able to walk around without the crowds and sample some of the stalls you can't get near at the weekends.||April 4, 2017
Valentina M||50||I stumbled upon this gem while wandering the streets of London and let me tell you it was the best experience imaginable for a food lover like myself! So many flavors and cultures in one place with lively atmosphere! I had British pie and some lamb wrap from Soul food. Definitely the most beautiful memory from this trip!||April 4, 2017
Utrocket71||40||We went on a Thursday afternoon and they were packed but the food was great. A lot of variety. We also purchased cheeses. They were ll so good and well priced. The vendors were very helpful. The market has it all; cheeses, baked goods, fish, fruits and veggies, crafts, wines, breakfast, lunch, dinner.... everything. well worth the visit and convenient from the London Bridge Tube Station.||April 3, 2017
ppa10||50||Great market. So many different possibilities do eat and drink. Good quality food at decent prices. For sure a place to visit!!||April 3, 2017
Timothy U||50||We stayed at an apartment close to here and went to the market for morning coffee and breakfast treats as well as supplies for dinner. Lots of fresh food (meats, cheese, baking, sweets, local spreads) and great options if you are cooking your own meals. During the week the options aren't as full and it doesn't get going until later in the morning but Friday-Sunday it is awesome.||April 3, 2017
GerCon2014||50||As the song goes so good they named it twice. Well so good we visited twice at different times of consecutive days. Yes maybe somethings are a little bit pricey but you are paying for the whole Street food experience. Well worth the effort time and money. It has a great buzz and warmth. Go enjoy and immerse yourself in the atmosphere. Food is fun and the market encapsulates that, likeminded people sharing time and food together. What could be better. ||April 3, 2017
kobdik||50||Hard to explain if you never been to places like this one. Variety of food from all around the world in different sizes and for different tastes. Quite the experience for a foodie.||April 2, 2017
Samantha G||30||These markets had a lot of great food choices and soo many free samples to try, however is super busy on the weekend - would recommend going during the week. I also found the food was a little overpriced. But definitely worth a visit.||April 2, 2017
wiseguy1282005||40||We liked it here. All items were displayed nicely from different stalls. You could feel the sense of organization in there. Therefore it was good to watch.At least they didn't just show the junk in other markets.Good show.||April 1, 2017
PrasadPednekar||50||Being closer to my office it was the most frequently visited location for lunch. With the variety of delicacies from all around the world, it's hard to choose a favorite. Be it Ethopian, Indian, Malay etc. I thoroughly lived the kangaroo burger at the exotic meat shop along with the cider just opposite it. Don't forget to try oysters or the Malaysian Curry or Lamb chops.The icing on the cake would be the patesserie at the start which boosts of a variety of cheese cakes. ||April 1, 2017
Hope772000||30||I went to Borough Market on my own to explore & found that there is lots of varieties but lack of specialty in the market. A lot of stores selling cheese, meat, seafood, pastries etc... but there are no famous one which worth going except the fish & chips which are fresh. I loved the fries that's all. The rest ain't impressive. The store owners are unfriendly & though they let you tasted the their food but well... it is not an Organised layout of the different kind of food. Somehow not all cheese stores are side by side ... they are scattered around & so different to price & quality compared. The food there are also overpriced. ||April 1, 2017
Jamie O||50||Some lovely food here. I have the King prawn egg noodles, beautiful. There are a couple of jars you can choose from to have a shrimp oil added or a chilli. BEWARE of the chilli one as it will set your mouth on fire. The dumplings are also very nice and Garlicy too. Most food in Borough market is quite pricey but it's nice. There are long tourist quewe's because it's so popular. It's a lovely place to visit and eat from. Give it a try. ||April 1, 2017
Cacabesa||50||What a great way to spend an afternoon in London. You can take a stroll on the east bank of the Thames on a Saturday morning and end up around lunch in the Borough market. If you see like me and love food, well then you shouldn't miss this place were you can spoil yourself with pretty much everything that you can think of: from hundreds of types of cheeses and salami to oysters and sea urchin, from French sandwiches with confit de canard to fantastic little baguettes with Spanish chorizo with pimento and arugula. Or if you like Indian food, you can get the masala tucked between the German bratwurst and the Egyptian flat breads. Carry cash and don't be mind the crowd and you will have a nice time. ||April 1, 2017
JadeMarieBlossom||50||Borough Market is London's oldest food market, and it's a beautiful, history steeped, visual treat.The sights, smells and tastes that fill the market leave you overwhelmed and very hungry.The stalls range from meat, to herbs, to fruit and veg, to baked goods. Whatever you want to buy, you will find. There are also several street food stalls from many different nations: Germany to Ethiopia, so you can not only buy the ingredients to cook the food, but savour it being made for you too.The market is a cultural and exciting experience that I feel has something for everyone.As a day out it can also be relatively cheap, or even free. Many stalls offer free samples, but I promise, if you taste, you'll want to buy. Our visit was based around needing lunch and we both had meals from the street food stalls, drinks from the smoothie stand, and sweet treats from a lovely baker, and spent around £15 each. So whatever your budget a lovely trip to make, even if only for the experience. Personally I could have spent all day here looking at everything over and over again but I would imagine around an hour or two would give you sufficient time to fully browse and eat.||April 1, 2017
Obsidiannn||50||This is THE MARKET for foodies! It certainly did not disappoint! There are endless options, you could spend half a day wondering around. It was truly an experience to remember! ||April 1, 2017
robinl805||50||We always try to include a Saturday morning visit whenever we go to London, whilst it's free, we always end up spending more than we expected, if you like truffles, cheese, bread, salami, and lots more, it's great. We always buy some pasta from La Tua pasta, take it home, freeze some but will be having some tonight, lots of great flavours, great quality. You can taste most things before you buy, so well worth an hour or so.||April 1, 2017
LSUGirl||20||Maybe it was because we were here on a Saturday, but this Market was so crowded that it is impossible to enjoy and see any of it. What seemed like a billion people were packed in the Market shoulder to shoulder with elbows swung out while trying to eat the street food offerings. Many spilled onto the sidewalk and street in front of the adjacent Southwark Cathedral. Everyone was standing in groups, so it was very difficult to move through the crowd while keeping the family together. The choice was to give attention to the surrounding shops or to pay attention to the family so that we were not seperated. We chose the latter, and was not able to enjoy this Market at all.||April 1, 2017
Mark W||50||So much choice, variety and quality of food in one market. It specialises in both takeaway (street food) and groceries. The atmosphere is very pleasant and their aren't any pushy vendors. My girlfriend and I spent a few hours in and around the market having nice food and drink and just enjoying the place. Essential.||March 31, 2017
Daisypita||50||Good place to go for a walk and have a meal, i have been there few times and always try different food, they have so many kind of food and from different places, i really recommend to go there! ||March 31, 2017

elysha68||40||We are very happy with the visit, nice food, pastries except the honey stall girl is tremendously rude||March 31, 2017
JRAluv2travel||50||My wife and I had come here on two different occasions on our recent trip to London. Obviously, depending on which direction you come from you will be immediately be greeted by the cheese shop that sells the cheese toastie and the Racelette. Holy cow, there is not a better way to experience the market than walking around nibbling on those. Salty oily goodness over potatoes or a crispy caramelized cheese toastie with leeks.This place literally has it all and if I lived here, I would go absolutely broke. They have numerous spots that sell fresh locally made cheese, all the fruits and vegetables you can think of. Multiple meat stalls and one was even butchering some meat while we were walking by.Fresh baked breads, pastries, oysters and sea urchin that are opened up when ordered.Some other stalls we got food from were the roast stall, we had the pork belly sandwich. The pork itself was just melt in your mouth the the rendered fat giving it tons of flavor and moisture. The cracklin was very crisp, almost like a potato chip and gave it a slight smoky flavor. We also had the fish and chips. Really good.Again, this place has everything for everyone. My single favorite place on earth and in my opinion makes pike place market look like walmart.||March 30, 2017
295jackp||50||We came here for lunch and wandered around for a couple of hours trying a few different food stalls. We had a confit duck wrap, a mulled wine, a scotch egg, some gyoza dumplings and a cookie and they were all incredible. The scotch eggs in particular were great and would come highly recommended. Bring at least £20 as there is so much on offer but some dishes can be relatively expensive. This is great for a short visit, up to 2/3 hours and no longer.||March 30, 2017
LynnZastrow||50||Vendor style food and farmers market. Very eclectic. Sweets were fabulous. Both Roast pork sandwich, fish and chips great. Pass on the Pad Thai vendor. Nice stop between the Shard and millennium bridge/St Paul's. Easy walk from either. ||March 30, 2017
robertbakewell||50||Splendid place to go and observe and sample some of the best local product around. Very close to the Shard. The market is well worth the visit for food and drink, best quality, very reasonably priced.||March 30, 2017
beabeabun||50||I came for a nosey and ended up knees deep in different types of food! Absolutely loved spending hours here and ended up bring food back for the fam. I bought some honey roast mixed nuts and some coconut little pancakes and the pub which is conveniently located in the centre. My friend got the chicken kebab and it was to die for! Cannot wait to go back to London and go back!||March 30, 2017
EuroCityWeekender||50||Our sons, who both work in London, have been raving about Ginger Pig hot sausage rolls for ages. When we visited Borough Market - so convenient for London Bridge station (exit by the Shard, turn right and cross the road at the end - BM is straight in front of you) we were delighted to see that Ginger Pig had a stall and they had hot sausage rolls for sale. It cost £8 for two sausage rolls, so we really hoped our sons hadn't oversold it! They hadn't - it was the most sublime (and huge!) sausage roll we have ever eaten in our lives. Thin and crispy pastry, a huge amount of sausagemeat and just the right amount of seasoning - not too salty, and not even overly-greasy, surprisingly. As to the rest of Borough Market .... if you haven't visited, we'd it's absolutely worth it. Lots of really interesting stalls - food and drink obviously (with lots of opportunities to taste) but also crockery and other food associated goods. Friendly people - busy, of course, but the atmosphere wouldn't be the same without that. Lots of take-away opportunities if you like to sightsee and eat as you go (nowhere to sit that we noticed). Certainly it would be a cheese-lovers idea of heaven, lots of cold meats from around the world too. If you are good with a camera you will find plenty to take pictures of - it's so colourful and vibrant. Allow 1.5 - 2 hours to see (and taste!) everything. Could combine this with seeing Tower Bridge, The Shard, The Golden Hind and the The Tower of London.||March 30, 2017
JimmyC702||40||Variety of food, baked good, fresh juices and even candy. Come with an appetite but come early, a lot of times the vendors sell out of stuff. It gets so packed that you may end up having to eat your food while standing, find a place to sit during peak hours can be a challenge. ||March 30, 2017
KentTheval||40||Well i bump into this place by accident.... when i reach there i am very happy cause i was hungry and they have like street food market there... plenty of choices internationally. you can choose different types of food there and also some grocery perhaps for cheese, smoke meat or even seafood... the price for food is not cheap though but should try as it look nice and delicious. definitely a must go place for foreginer||March 29, 2017
272ruthw||50||I think Borough Market is a gem of a place to visit. It's easy to get to & in a lovely building. Plus it's main draw of course is the sheer variety of food that is available to try & buy! We went for lunch. So after checking out all the competition we opted for 'street' food purchasing Gujarati & Ethiopian veggie selection. Personally I preferred the spicier Gujarati dishes but my companion preferred the Ethiopian! If you are feeling carnivorous there is loads of choice to. And fish, cakes, olives & I could go on! ||March 29, 2017
Will T||40||It was a cool market to go to while I took my weekend trip in London. I was able to get a very wide variety of food like fruits, juices, and tried the curry which was absolutely delicious and fairly priced. Recommend going on an empty stomach to try a bunch of different options.||March 29, 2017
Ramirezdoc||40||This place gets crazy during the day - all of the stalls are open, selling things from all around the world. Foods, gifts, etc. A cacophony of sights, sounds and smells, it is extremely crowded. At night, the stalls are mostly closed but for a few food places nearby, but it is safe to walk through. You won't leave without buying something!||March 29, 2017
Gmaedontplay||50||Borough Market is a fun market with yummy food options. Make sure to check when they close because they do not stay open late, the first time we went we were too late! They have an assortment of different types of food so everyone can find something they love. Borough Market is also used when filming movies and shows quite often, this is where you will find Bridget Jones' apartment, the Leaky Cauldron from the Harry Potter films (it's the Taco restaurant), and the series Sherlock also filmed inside the Market. My photos are from a night walking Tour for Muggles we did that starts in the area so the stands were all closed.||March 29, 2017
MesterWester||50||Our first visit to Borough Market. Lots of very exciting shops, with a great variety of product. Very interesting just to walk around and observe - and taste some of the specialties.Definitely worth a visit, and we will for sure come back next time we visit London.||March 28, 2017
christophers8888||50||Arrived at 11.00am - departed @ 3.30pm & never had a dull moment ; plenty to see , try & buy as well as eat / drink / relax.So many foodie stalls / eateries / shops everywhere that time just flies by & you do not have to spend a fortune if you chose not to !Well worth a visit - all ages||March 28, 2017
VictoriaXara||50||Absolutely love this market! Excellent food & drinks. Such interesting cuisines with lots of different things, it is really difficult to choose what to eat! If I was local, I'd go there pretty much every day! Pictured: Amazing fresh & refreshing watermelon juice||March 28, 2017
JenTok||40||Visited here on a Saturday and it was very busy. We came to taste many different things and weren't disappointed! I even had a sea urchin (disgusting, but I had to try it). The food in the stalls looks good and the sellers were very nice, giving out things to try.It's a pity there isn't a bigger designated seating area in the market, the few seats that are there are filling up very quickly.||March 28, 2017
monicacZ2312BE||50||A must market to visit whilst in London if you are a foodie. An amazing market with a wide selection of international and local products, food and flavours to savour and purchase. There is a great extensive selection of food stalls with sublime cuisines from around the world, from bangers & marsh to Gzoyos and duck wraps. There are some eateries with sitting as well. There are also a few wine bars and coffee places. Bedales has a great selection of wine and Monmouth has great coffee and a good breakfast spot too. Saturday about 4.30pm is a great time for bargains where fish, meat, vegetables and fruits are discounted massively. ||March 28, 2017
O2692SRlisa||50||Came here on a Friday and it was fairly busy. The food looked amazing and smelled great. If we'd had more time would've explored a bit more. ||March 27, 2017
Tipperary_12||50||Ive been to Borough Market a good few times never disappoints - you can literally have your whole meal here with all the samples - its just a pity that I cannot ever bring food home so that is why you have to eat it there, pies are amazing and cornish pasties as well.||March 27, 2017
Bob_D_Traveller||50||Borough Market is a perfect mix of true street market and foodie heaven, with some local hangout and tourist trap thrown in. Pâté Moi has a mushroom pâté that is simply killer; Karaway Bakery's traditional breads are superb (ask for samples) and many of the green grocers have native, heirloom apples. Artisan du Chocolat's bars come in unique flavors - we love the Tobacco Dark - and they travel well. But don't leave - or buy cheese - before you find Neal's Yard Dairy. It is worth the time to queue if you have to. Again, sample first - they are generous and fantastically knowledgeable. If you are a Stilton fan, try the Stichelton.||March 26, 2017
teddya323||50||If you are a market lover, and I think there are quite a few of us, this one is a must. Prepare to be amazed at the variety offered in this fantastic structure. At the various stalls there are many offerings to be enjoyed, and even more items for purchase and later use, On each visit I make a new discovery; French smoked garlic being my most recent. Shopping at Borough Market makes you feel like a local.||March 26, 2017
JenK105||40||Super foodie afternoon spent in Borough Market, beautiful product, amazing producers, a real sense of London ||March 26, 2017
MIADangerous||40||It is worth travelling to this part of town just to come to this market. All you find is food and you won't find any bargains here, just top quality cooked or fresh meats, fish, veg, fruit, veg, cheeses, and as you can imagine the list doesn't end. Producers literally travel from all over the UK to sell their wares here. You can do your weeks shopping here and you will say Ouch when you see how much you spent but its worth the money. Even if you just want some sweet treats or a fruit juice its probably the best you will taste in London, and yes you will pay for that.||March 26, 2017
DulceHeartSF||50||Love food and hanging out with locals? Borough Market is a must place to visit. Wonderful place to sample various fresh and organic food while experiencing fantastic vibe from all of the visitors and vendors. ||March 25, 2017
Hann2403||50||Amazing market jam packed with every type of food/drink you can imagine.Stalls are so varied you're sure to find something to tickle your fancy.Had breakfast from the Boston sausage stand which is lovely!!!!The breads, cheeses and meats are definitely ones to sample. Oliveology is also a must, amazing olive leaf tea not to mention the authentic oils.||March 25, 2017
shaneh589||50||This is a market like no other. Food, food, food, oddities, restaurants, pubs, music, bars, cooking, coffee, seafood. Fabulous. This is a London attraction not to be missed. Been substantially expanded recently. Market on this site since 1756. Take tube to London Bridge just near the 'Shard'. Open every day except Sunday. Saturday is bedlam but great. ||March 25, 2017
Aysia W||40||We went on a Saturday during lunch time so it was jam packed and very hard to see every single vendor. It was very hard to get through the crowds of people even. But I expected nothing less for a Saturday. I was under the impression that there would be a ton of places to eat big, filling meals.. it's a market so there were just tons of vendors that sold little meals. People say to "go hungry" so I did but it was a TON of fish vendors and I don't eat fish. There were a mix of fruits/vegetables, Thai, Chinese, Mediterranean, duck.. interesting mix. We went to Lail Live and I got a plate of egg noodle with chicken topped with four chicken gyoza dumplings all for 9£! It was delicious. For dessert, I got a decent piece of raspberry cheesecake from a vendor for 3£! I forgot the name of it but I have a picture!||March 25, 2017
JimMaura||50||My daughters and I visited Borough Market on March 13, 2017. We arrived around 1 p.m. and the market was busy with the lunch crowd. There are so many fantastic options for food ranging from Vegan to roast meats that anyone will be able to find something they like. We tried Soul Food, Pieminister and some desert stalls. The food was served quickly and tasted great. I appreciated the history of the market and highly recommend a visit!||March 25, 2017
murray_campbell250||50||We always seem to end up at Borough Market when we go to London, if you want to try different foods from around the world then go here. There are restaurant around the market, but if you want to try various food go to the Market stalls, there is everything from veggie to oyster foods and loads of cheese, breads, cake & Olives stalls - Love this Market ||March 25, 2017
bzmd53||50||It is puzzling that this is not on the map for things to do when you are in London for a few days. This place is glorious, the foods are amazing and fresh and the bustle is impossible not to get caught up in. If you are looking for a place to sit, you can go all the way to where the vendors are selling burgers, paella, etc....there are tables there. Some are reserved for a particular restaurant, but others are not.||March 25, 2017
Cheketa D||50||You must go hungry. There is such an abundance of deliciously fresh, quality food here that you'll want to try as many food vendors as possible. Also, the food portions are substantial. Don't make the mistake of having breakfast beforehand like I did. I could only manage a fresh mango juice and the toasted cheese sandwich from Kappacasein Dairy (both of which were amazing) before I tapped out. If I could do it all over again, I would start my day here with breakfast, go for a walk around London Bridge, and then come back for lunch. You're welcome!||March 24, 2017
poppyr17||40||We really enjoyed our walk round Borough on a Thursday afternoon. The traders we spoke to were warm and friendly and eventually settled on having a Pad Thai lunch- although it was difficult to choose! The little samples persuaded us to buy some goats choose with herbs which was lovely. However, the food for sale is not cheap (although the hot take away food is mostly good value for money). It's also worth noting that this is a busy spot which attracts many so it can be difficult to walk in a straight line as crowds of people are drawn in all directions, mouths watering, towards the different food stalls!||March 24, 2017
Travelain3||50||Soak in the buzzing atmosphere of one of London's largest and oldest food markets. The selection of food and produce here is amazing, from fish to meat to cheeses and breads and more! The food stalls offer tasty food to go as well, albeit on the slightly pricier side for street food, however always delicious and convenient to grab a bite while you continue to walk around the market. Queues can be quite long though, but worth it. ||March 24, 2017
szymonp1992||50||Great things to eat, the air in there, it is filled with tempting smells. A lot of fantastic food, paella, coffee, cakes - everything worth recommending. For sure try dried tomatoes from the Italian guy||March 24, 2017
nicolasZ6408LS||40||Quality food, loads of sights & smells! Find it all here. Usually v busy. If only they would put some benches & tables to sit & enjoy the food / drink||March 23, 2017
ilovedgreece||40||My hotel happened to be right by the market which was a huge plus. I also went over the Christmas holidays which was festive! I tried out the mulled wine and a fantastic burger. Would highly recommend checking out the market, grabbing a bite to eat, checking out some of the local pubs and grabbing a drink!||March 23, 2017
TACOB0B||50||We visit Borough market every time we come to London. We have done the tourist thing and it is a good market for the foodies but these days we visit for one reason only, the vegetable samosas at the Gujarati Rosoi Indian food stand. These little babies are excellent. We highly recommend.||March 23, 2017
CatieCFulwood||50||lots of differing foods, drinks and restaurants a true foodie heaven. We ate at the Brazilian BBQ and shopped at the German market too.||March 23, 2017
foodiescrumptious51||40||Worth arriving early on Saturday morning to buy the best produce. It's not cheap but you are buying quality and with there being so many stalls, there's not much food wise you'll can't buy here. Perfect if you're hosting a dinner party or cooking for a special occasion. There are plenty of stalls selling fast food but for those who prefer restaurant dining, there is a good selection. Easy to reach from London Bridge Station. ||March 23, 2017
354maciekt||50||Cool place with shops and food trucks/stands. Ypu can buy here everything you can dream of. Swiss cheeses, Spanish seafood, English Pies, French wines just everything one may need to be happy :) A variety of food trucks with food from all over the world. Good place also for cheap eats in London. ||March 23, 2017
Baseball167||50||Fun place for lunch, many stalls. Baked items, fresh produce, great street food close to tower & London bridge||March 22, 2017
pherbert1||50||We have visited the Market many times, Its a really traditional old London market, mainly all artisan street food, fruit and veg, breads and meat, usually the quality of the produce is outstanding, the choice of unusual veg is great, really different breads and sweets, the choice of street food covers all tastes and is fresh and excellent, it can get very crowded especially Saturday , but well worth a visit||March 22, 2017
Mealpup||50||Busy and bustling market with the most exotic and beautifully presented food everywhere you look. Lively atmosphere and food to tempt you at every stall. You don't have to buy anything. Just soak up the atmosphere. I don't know how I managed to resist the salted caramel licorice but my willpower failed me and I had to buy some amazing Italian blue cheese soaked in red wine. Divine! Go and enjoy. Find Bridget Jones's front door...||March 22, 2017
wanderingkale||40||Had a good time visiting this market and seeing the different things for sale. The food offerings were all over the place and it was a cool mashup of cultures.||March 22, 2017
humu1||50||I visited several markets while in the UK, and this one was my favorite. You should find it in enjoyable as well, so long as your yearning is food-based. They have a plethora of vendors peddling consumables such as seafood, meat, produce, bread, and cheese. There were also vendors offering hot meals from various cultures, which makes lunch time a good time to visit. I especially like the bakery vendor, Bread Ahead. They have an onsite bakery as well as a large table with an assortment of fresh-baked items. I loved the rosemary focaccia. Even if you're not hungry, you can appreciate the atmosphere of all of the activity of the market, not to mention the rumbling of the trains going by overhead. I consider Borough Market a must see. ||March 22, 2017
Stephenie A||50||I would visit here every day if I could. It's huge, with fresh prepared before your eyes meals and produce up the wazoo. Whether you want to eat at one of the restaurants (we ate at fish! Where we had the best cod and chips EVER - and we know this for a fact because we ate fish and chips all over England and Northern Ireland) or pick up some street food (the raclette is super tasty) it's a must visit. It's also great to pick up some produce for "make at the hotel' breakfasts or snacks - the huge array of produce, breads, cheeses, honey, sweets, etc ensure you can take away any number of things and make a great meal yourself later on! ||March 22, 2017
MichaelS22218||50||What a great little surprise that we stumbled upon. This market is situated underneath an underpass and has everything you can imagine for purchase whether it be food,goods or BEER. I highly recommend going here as it's a great place to taste local food and absorb local culture. ||March 22, 2017
SusyP73||50||A must see while in London! The energy here is amazing, be warned it's packed later in the week and especially Saturday so bring your patience with you. As a tourist, great place to come with your fellow travellers as there's food options for everyone, lots of amazing food vendors. Will make this a definite must whenever visiting London!||March 21, 2017
Yenon H||50||The market is located buy the river and you can travel along the bank of the river to get there.The market is very clean, food from all over the world.Prices are quit far and you can buy some food and do a picnic nearby Very good place to buy presents for the family and to eat ||March 21, 2017
isissme||50||This is one of my favorite places to go in Londen. Its amazing cultures, wondeful food, nice people, everything about was perfect. I really recommend this to everyone who goes on a trip to Londen!||March 21, 2017
bensont739||40||Was in London for a work trip and had some one for a walk at the market. Didn't regret my choice even though it was a week day. The Borough market offers a good selection of seafood, meats n cheese. I had the paella n the famous Monmouth coffee. Lots of photo op n a great place to look for dips n sauces ||March 21, 2017
and49||50||We visited whilst staying with friends at the Premier Inn London Bridge for a long weekend. We went on a Saturday the first time and spend ages looking round all the stalls, sampling food and ending up having a really good cheap breakfast at the Market Cafe within the market (£31 for cooked breakfasts, drinks and toast for six adults). We revisited on Sunday to find that the market was closed and again on the Monday morning but found there were only a few stalls open and the cafe was closed. Definitely worth visiting on a Saturday when it is in full swing. ||March 21, 2017
intrepidtravelerfla||50||Read about this and wandered over Friday afternoon last week. Very easy to get to from Kensington on the underground. Spent about 2 hours just wandering, eating, watching and it is absolutely worth the trip. The array of food, meats, fish and stuff to buy is amazing.||March 20, 2017
MeganZ138||50||Delicious food and scents all over the place. I bouth an English truffle mustard, an egnlish afternoon tea and a chocolate porter bear :)||March 20, 2017
buffalojim67||30||The Borough Market is one of those fun and interesting places in London to spend some time and enjoy the products that are available. Nice covered venue for spending some time enjoying one of the unique sites in the city.||March 20, 2017
686chrise||50||Visiting a friend there , my first visit to this wonderful place , how could anyone fail to be impressed by the amount of variety of foods from all over the World and items cooked and baked in the market - a must to visit and finding a Golden Hinde parked behind it was a bonus||March 20, 2017
Chillyourbeans||50||Good atmosphere and lots of interesting things to buy. For food to eat there and then the prices are good. Expect to pay a little more for other things, but then it's great quality and nice to treat yourself.||March 20, 2017
Jasmine J||50||Good place for a cheap lunch. Wide variety of different cuisines with a lot of vegan options. And as the title says, TRY THE VEGAN BURGERS :)||March 20, 2017
ChrisBiz1||50||Unique location and architecture, this place is so much fun. Even the path to get there is fantastic! You'll love the approach and when it opens onto the market, you know you've arrived as it gets busy, noisy and the air is filled with the smell of aromas from all over the world, exactly what you would expect from a market. But, this place will surprise you. And that will be your own to personally experience. Expect huge crowds on Saturdays. ||March 20, 2017
iamcorb||50||So if you're visiting London, the Borough Market is one of those places that you're going to want to visit if you love fresh foods and craft beverages. Here you will find many artisans who have perfected their work, some stalls offering similar items, but each with very different tastes! It's basically foodie heaven. Be aware, the doughnuts are no joke and you must try them before they sell out!!||March 20, 2017
Drum_Davey||40||Borough Market is a nice place to visit especially if you are in the Southwark area. There are food stalls with special produce in one section and in another section you can have something to eat and choose from a different range of international cuisines.I decided to try the Ethiopian stall and had a delicious meal which consisted of injera bread with a beef, chicken and lentil stew plus some spinach and rice. I was there in the morning so it is not quite so busy but ai would imagine it would be a lot busier around lunchtime and the afternoon.||March 19, 2017
Sprogsitter||50||Meeting up with friends for the weekend.They'd heard there was good food.We'd never been so off we went!Brilliant experience.Throw yourself in and try everything!Prices are fair.Variety was great.||March 19, 2017
ebucka||50||Saturday is best time to visit because during the week when the "full" market opens (Wednesday), there are some open areas that will fill in with more vendors on Saturday. Enjoyed the sounds of the trains passing overhead. Very rustic. Be sure to read the signs that have been there for decades outlining the market rules. Crowded on Saturday even in February when cold, but worth it. Try the fresh oysters they'll shuck them right in front of you!!||March 19, 2017
Viola539||50||Oh god, where do i begin? This place is full with delicious food that would make you drool just looking at them! The selection of food is amazing and you should definitely spend a meal here. I tried the pear & apple tea, scallops, seafood paella, and pizza bread all from different stands!! alllll were delicious! dont let yourself visiting london without going to Borough Market! ||March 19, 2017
rodneya367||50||There are so many great stalls and vendors offering both prepared food and raw ingredients. We tried several and enjoyed them all.I wish we would have found this earlier, as it is a great place to get a bite to eat and everyone can have the style of food they like. ||March 19, 2017
Mick1803||50||Nice place to have a stroll and do some tastings of different food and finally decide for some place to have lunch. Great selection of really good market food. I quite like the booth that sells cheese from Berne. Eventually I often decide for the rock oysters.||March 19, 2017
oh227||50||The food stalls here are amazing. There are around 15 different stalls that are all selling a different cuisine - from Ethiopian food to hog roast. Prices are reasonable with a main averaging at about £6. There are plenty of amazing dessert stalls and a great Turkish stand with mixed fruit, nuts and Turkish delight. A definite must-visit when in London! ||March 19, 2017
Toni C||20||Nice selection of stalls from what we could see but Saturday lunch time crowds were indescribable- too many people hold the see anything, nowhere to sit to eat the food from the stalls. Shame was so busy I think Camden is better It's just up the road n turn left as u come out of the tube station Don't think I'd go back, perhaps a midweek visit I'm not sure today put me off||March 18, 2017
carobarbs||50||I hit up the market today after a late lunch but the stalls were still going strong. Picked up fish and produce for dinner, honey, olive oil, and wish I'd come hungry because the prepared food stalls smelled amazing. Got some really lovely produce I haven't seen at my local market, like baby artichokes, wet garlic, and some really fresh looking white asparagus. Fish monger had an excellent selection of smoked fish, shellfish, and whole as well as filet fish. I'll definitely be coming back as spring yields start rolling in.||March 18, 2017
Jonny B||40||Located under a rail bridge, this market has all the hustle and bustle one would expect from a food market, this adds to the atmosphere. With loads of enticing food on offer, i opted for Gastronomica and ordered the salami and mozzarella piadina, which was good. For a sweet treat i went to Greedy Goat and had a waffle with nutella and a scoop of Salted Caramel ice cream, which was delicious. Overall another fantastic market in London.||March 18, 2017
454mariaj||50||We loved the market! Huge variety of prepared foods, and fantastic treats and cheeses as well! Go hungry !!! It's a nice alternative for a casual meal. Everything g we tried was delicious !||March 18, 2017
Docmatt||50||Very busy on the weekend but go for the freshest bread, cheese, tea, goat, sausage, fish, milk, steaks, beer, juices just everything. There isn't anything this place doesn't sell. Browse till you eat.||March 18, 2017
BFung S||50||Recently revisited London after a hiatus of a few years. Used to go there every weekend when living in the city years ago. It is as good as ever. And now fully/partially open most days of the week except Sunday. Keep it up! ||March 18, 2017
alonradzi||50||What a place! Don't come full...Lots of great stools with cheeses, meets and other great stuff. Make sure to visit both sides!||March 17, 2017
Redcarjohn007||50||Lots of choice of different street foods. Good quality foods stalls and shops and generally a good place to wander and savour the atmosphere. Keep a look out for when there is a full or partial market as not all stalls are open every day, so go to the borough markets website to see what's on and when - good website.||March 17, 2017
gracel76||50||Chicken combo medium box is great value for money (£10 for 2) and absolutely delicious. Not tried Ethiopian food before but I was drawn in by the smells and so glad I gave it a go. Thoroughly enjoyed it and it kept me full until our evening meal.||March 17, 2017
Susan_7654||50||We thoroughly enjoyed browsing around in the market. Unfortunately we made the mistake of coming after lunch, as we didn't realize all the wonderful prepared food would be available. Come here hungry! Great selection of local produce, cheeses, meats. We bought some fantastic cheese and fudge to nibble on later in the hotel. Really interesting place and good people watching.||March 17, 2017
Gigi K||50||An ancient market on the Thames. Excellent vendors. FISH! fish and chips does a great job. The have both a restaurant with table service and a take away window. But the total must is to find the Ginger Pig. Order their sausage roll. Yes, you want it hot. You're welcome.||March 17, 2017
Elizabeth C||50||Gujarati Rasoi - this stall sells great food called Thali (a healthy vegetarian dish) served in a little cardboard box, filled with rice, spicy cauliflower, peas, potatoes etc., and wonderful aromatic spices. There seemed to be an endless queue the whole time we were there.||March 17, 2017
LadyCat86||50||This is one of the places I always go to when I am in London. It has flavours from all over the world and it really is a wonderful discovery everytime. On weekends it might be crowded but it's good midweeks. Try the bakeries, the fresh fruit juices, cheeses, the fried squids and the chicken bun. ||March 17, 2017
TGKoh||40||Very nice market to visit for a wide variety of food under 1 roof. Also had the best fish and chips here in London. Definitely worth a visit when in London.||March 16, 2017
brbkorbinite||50||Our tour guide at the British museum tipped us off to this hotspot. I was hankering for some proper fish and chips and my wife was looking for a delicious bratwurst. We found both here and much much more! I could've spent 5hours here just eating. But if you're near tower bridge, London bridge or London tower this is worth the 10min or less walk to grab a bit. Dozens of choices from vendors making fresh whole food and nearly all the prices are competitively presented, everyone wants your business so generally quite affordable. We went during lunch on a Thursday and lines were only 2-5 people deep, we both were eating within 5mins!||March 16, 2017
jeffsM3943VF||50||Wide variety of local and specialty foods. Seating is limited, food is served walking style. Everything from Indian, Thai, pies, cheese, vegan and burgers. Fun place and good food reasonably priced. ||March 16, 2017
AirSchis||40||We heard about this place originally from an Anthony Bourdain episode. He was raving about it and for good reasons. Located just near the London Bridge and easy to find under the south end of the bridge. Just follow the signs. The place was packed and covers a number of city blocks. Mostly casual food places and the ability in some places to buy beer and/or wine to drink with your meal. So many casual food places to choose from. English food and other European styled cuisine. Bring cash. Lots of queues of many locals with us tourists. Artisanal food and proud of what they serve. We loved our meals and found a table to drink, eat and people watch in the afternoon sun. There is a toilet facility located in the western area by following the signs. You will really enjoy this place and a fantastic lunch opportunity done relatively cheaply.||March 16, 2017
JuliaH4498||50||Every time we are back to London, we go to Borough Market! Oysters and Prosecco, French baguete, cold cuts, berries and fresh vegetables. A bit of pate. This is our traditional catch at Borough Market! The food is fresh and simply fantastic here, as well as the atmosphere. Forget about Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, or Tower Bridge - spend your day at Borough Market instead!Note! It closes around 3pm, so plan your visit accordingly.||March 15, 2017
Marsse||40||Busy indoor food market with some great stalls. We were there on a Thursday so it seemed to be full of local workers out for a 'standing lunch' and tourists. All nationalities selling their foodstuffs. Definitely a place to re-visit.||March 15, 2017
stav s||40||it's a nice food market however, they have some booths that are not that good- if you get there at lunch you can taste sample and only then decide what to get- i'd suggest that.. definitely worth taking some cheese and other fun foods home if its your last day. if you go there, you should know that underneath the london bridge really close by there's another food market- so it might be fun to combine. if you are looking for desserts- try a honeycomb salted caramel donut- soooo gooood||March 14, 2017
Diana S||40||We did not know about the existence of this market, we were just walking around when we got there.It was a nice time we spent at the market, not only eating but taking a look at all the groceries, food and curiosities.You can find a lot of meal options, even you can find gluten-free options (also for desserts!).I would greatly recommend the experience.||March 14, 2017
Roberta1330||50||One if the things I enjoy is visiting this place each time I go to London. It is vibrant and huge! Tasting foodstuffs as you walk along each area, is heavenly. The traders are very cheery and display cheeses, meats, vegetables etc for tasting. Never knew there were so many different colours of carrot! Well worth a visit.||March 14, 2017
Allie R||50||Has a wide range of food and drinks From fresh organic fruit and veg to home made pies .juice bars .cider and even live lobsters ...! Something for everyone and well worth while visiting ||March 13, 2017
378peterm378||50||Please don't eat a thing before visiting Borough Market.The food is great, something for everyone.The market is full of locals at the weekend and is in full swing by about 9 am.I like to get there at about 7.30am any day of the week, grab a takeaway coffee from Monmouth Coffee and watch them setting up the stalls and preparing the food.Bring a camera.||March 13, 2017
VarsadiR||50||Best place in town to try all kinds of street food. All great food from every nation or culture.Easy to get there by the underground.||March 13, 2017
SorchaBloom||50||One of my first experiences of London was Borough Market and I absolutely loved it. I've been back many times and it never gets old.Wonderful selection of food stalls selling everything from fresh ingredients to tasty street food. The atmosphere is always buzzing as it's usually always busy (particularly Saturday). All the vendors are super friendly and it's in a great location.Every visitor to London should come here for a bite to eat.||March 13, 2017
Heidi O||50||So much variety here. I got a goat kafta wrap from one of the vendors and it was incredible. I was wishing I bought two of them. You have such a huge selection here... unique cheeses, freshly butchered meats, amazing sweets and savory foods to choose from. It is in a beautiful old building and train tracks run above in some areas. Definitely recommend visiting this market when you're in London...more than once!||March 13, 2017
stug97||50||It is a fantastic food market, both fresh foods to buy, and prepared food to eat immediately.Incredibly busy, but still worth the crowds. Be warned suprisingly shut on Sundays!!Use London Bridge station, just across the road. ||March 12, 2017
Stourmouth||50||Borough market is on the south bank near the mayflower replica ship and the shard. Busy Buzzing and reasonable prices and fantastic pop up eateries too ||March 12, 2017
hansenjenc||50||If you like food markets, you do not want to miss this one. Sample delectable treats from all over this continent from French and Spanish cheeses, Iberico ham, food grad, truffle oils and English mulled wine to Asian spices and Turkish sweets. Easy walk along the Embankment from The London Eye down to this spot across the Thames from St Paul's. ||March 12, 2017
Courtz4444||50||Any type of food you want you can get here.Plenty of fresh fruit & vegetable stalls.Sweets, cakes & pastries.Burger, fish& chips, Asian etc.Deli style stalls witch cheese, meats & oils.Highly recommended!||March 12, 2017
markski85||50||I came here with a friend for lunch and was not disappointed. we walked around all the stalls first before deciding on having myself a Roasted Hog Roll. it was £6 and service was instant. the roasted Hog was spinning in front of my eyes and for £6 I thought it was very reasonable. I also had a Bannoffee pie ice cream milkshake from a stall across from the roasted hog which was amazing! the entire place was buzzing with a mix of young students to high end business men on their lunch breaks. their was a huge variety of options and it wasn't just hot street food on offer, various fresh cuts of meat and cheeses, fine wines and some great looking fruit stalls plus a few handmade sweets stall grabbed my attention too! all in all I would highly recommend this market if you get the chance. I believe its only open a few days a week so best to check ahead before making your way down.||March 12, 2017
ivydog2015||40||I'd say 2 hours is plenty to walk around the market. We sampled some excellent international dishes-we found seats in a busy atrium area to drop our bags and take a load off. For us, the first hour was all about eating and the second hour was more about looking around and the meats, cheeses, teas, etc. ||March 12, 2017
CChanny||50||One of the outstanding stalls is the Oyster stall. The two guys serving us are bubbly and delightful! The oysters are remarkably fresh and juicy. Another highlight is the fish & chips, a huge portion only costs around £9. What a great experience! ||March 12, 2017
fernweh56||40||Best visited during the week to avoid the jostling crowds but that experience could be fun too.It's a feast to the eyes , with its colours (check out the mushrooms), fruits and veggies in different shapes and sizes, the nose with the cheeses , truffles, frying food , mulled wine and the tongue with all the other different tasty bits on offer . Always come away with a few goodies like truffle oil , expressed c spices, cheeses and pates .Definitely worth a visit or two or three :)||March 11, 2017
toyinaah||50||There is lively atmosphere on entering the market and the street food are of such very high quality. One of our favourite was the seafood wrap lady on a Saturday. Then there are variety of fantastic cheese stalls. There is always so much to see and even buy and it was an unplanned part of our day visit to London.||March 11, 2017
RichardBlakey||50||I lived near Borough Market when at Medical School in the 80's and am sure the market was never like this!Packed on a Saturday morning with tourists including many Scottish rugby fans in kilts (bad luck chaps!)Not just lots of produce to buy but many places selling hot food, drinks including Champagne and freshly made juices.Had the feel of markets in Barcelona and Palma.Really enjoyed the experience. Great salt and pepper chilli squid!||March 11, 2017
holgern496||50||An absolutely cosmopolitan hot spot in London.Different food from all over the world. Street food close to standard market stands. Spices, Herbs, cheese. All you can imagine for your daily digestions.||March 11, 2017
catherinemL8442JB||50||Extremely busy all day long with locals, workers and tourists. You can buy beautiful fresh veg, wine, cheese, bread, fish and novelty food. The busiest section of the market is at lunch time when you can buy all kinds of fast food: German sausages, noodles, salt beef, vegan burgers, Ethiopian, Indian dishes you name it you can buy it hot. Not many places to sit down. Mostly under cover but best visited when it is dry.||March 11, 2017
laurenkelsey21||50||This food market is awesome. For prepared lunch food, or for buying fresh produce to take home and cook. If you're travelling from afar, I suggest taking a cool bag to buy stuff to take home as there's so much great food! Even if you're not buying, it's a great place to wander around. If you're a foodie - it's heaven. Would highly recommend the salt beef bagel stall, and the fresh pasta shop - delish.||March 11, 2017
DarthPicc0l0||40||Positives:Brilliant for farm produce. .Lots of variety of stalls.Attracts touristsPromotes small businessNegatives:People smoking in the entrancesNot much options for practicing Jews or MuslimsVery busy in the early afternoonImpossible to get around for those physically disabled||March 10, 2017

Brazzie5||40||We' ended up there after a long walk to the Tower Bridge. Lots of vendors selling delicious and interesting food. Will go back on our next trip to London. ||March 10, 2017
Emmab B||50||My friends and I were staying not far from here for a night out in Brixton and decided to visit on a whim and wow. This place is great lots of different foods to try from cheese, goat, paella, wine, olives, Turkish delight the list goes on. Even if you are not hungry it is good to go and have a wonder and pick up some yummy fresh food. Just follow your nose. I came home with more cheese than is necessary but couldnt resist lol. We got the number 21 bus from Old Kent Road it is literally a 2 minute walk from the borough bus stop and tube station. Plenty of people around to point you the right way. Definately worth a look if you are in the area.||March 9, 2017
hkh60||50||A lovely market with fresh fruits and veggies, wonderful English cheese, spices, sausage, and great little restaurants and food stands. Small samples all around and everything smells great and tastes even better. A good place to drop in for lunch between your touristy visits. A bus stop across the street so very convenient if you are traveling on an Oyster card.||March 9, 2017
neti2828||50||Well-known for its history and range of goods, the market had various types of exotic cheese from all over Europe as well as products like traditional vinegar, meat, spices, and fish. Loved the food they sell at one corner of the market. Very crowded. Easily accessible by subway. ||March 9, 2017
26lillys||50||It's hard to put into words how a genuine foodie feels after visiting Borough.The smells,the noises, the stalls,the sights and the people just make this place a must for food lovers.The fruit & vegetables in Turnips & Teds Veg are a sight to behold. Fizz by the glass is available, amazing cakes,handmade breads & pastries,artisan cheeses, beers and wines, chillies and pigs heads are all available here. Some real London bubble and squeak with sausage for breakfast is always good,and you'll meet some proper London folk too. You will NEVER be short of something to eat, whether it be street style food,Rueben sandwiches,or a slap up roast. It can be very,very crowded at times, not the best place for little ones in the afternoons. You could end up spending a fortune,but oh,what fun. GO!||March 9, 2017
Gaby L||40||Most guide books will suggest a particular stall. I loved the raclette myself. The portion was generous enough to serve as lunch for 2 Americans (I noticed 3 women split the same item and were quite content). They have all sorts of seafood and meats, sweets, drinks as well as Asian and other types of food. Fresh vegetables, fruit, meats and seafood, spices, garden items are all available as well as a range of drinks. There's free wifi and rustic bathrooms. ||March 9, 2017
Frog244||50||A bustling busy market Fridays/Saturdays particularly. Something to cater for everyone's palate. Plenty of choice from world cheeses, oils, bread, cakes (including gluten free), fruit & veg, fabulous fresh fish displays and a huge variety of foods from around the world. Market steeped in history & architecture. Good place to visit followed by a walk along the river.||March 8, 2017
Nikkibains78||50||Me and my husband visit this place at least twice a year due to our love for the Gourmet Goat stand and the free food samples. We often wander through the market with a glass of cold Prosecco in hand sampling the different cheeses and teas, but our real passion is Gourmet Goat who do the best gourmet kebabs ever (you can expect to pay around £12 for 2). They use the best ingredients and the owner is lovely. We love this place.||March 8, 2017
Sue N||40||After a service at Southwalk Cathedral, I called in to explore and buy some edible goods to take home from a business trip. I will be heading back one day to try lunch at the many hot food stalls that were setting up. I was sorry that I wasn't able to carry some of the lovely fresh fruit and vegetables on display, but I already had too much luggage. Came away with some giant pretzels, a spinach flan (for the veggie) and some interesting meaty products from Ginger Pig (for the carnivore). I walked along the Thames to Blackfriars tube station before heading for home. This market is definitely on my list for a repeat visit ||March 8, 2017
Blodynallen||50||We enjoyed our little trip to borough market, had a light lunch from some of the stalls there. The food was amazing. There's a super wine bar opposite Bridget Jones' house.-where they filmed the birthday cake scene.(can't remember what it was called) had a few wines here in a fantastic atmosphere. Staff were super too. I'd go here again when next in London.||March 8, 2017
Fernlay||50||Great for grazing or serious shopping. We had dinner at Wright Bros (Oysters of exceptional quality) and the next day came back and grazed for breakfast. Wish we lived nearer. The food stalls are fantastic. ||March 8, 2017
nilsstanton||50||Borough market is textbook example of a great London market. Endless produce from local fishmongers, butchers and grocers, as well as a choice of more street food than you can sample in a week. FYI. Salt beef sandwich is a must. ||March 8, 2017
8pairs||50||Welcome to foodie heaven. I love this place. Cheese, salami, bread, pastries, cakes, sweets, fresh fruit and veg and so much more. The quality and variety are vast and it is always so very busy. I just love it!||March 8, 2017
Allison L||50||The Borough Markets are one of my favorite places to visit in London. I walked along the southbank to get there on a lovely sunny winter day. I started with a coffee at Monmouth Coffee - a coffee lovers dream. I then wandered through the markets, tasting different foods along the way. Fish and Chips were delicious. Doughnuts from Bread Ahead are literally to die for. It was like taking a bite out of heaven. So many options to choose from, you'll get lost in the wonderful world of the Borough Markets! ||March 7, 2017
Roysreef||40||I visited fora late lunch and was overwhelmed by all the different flavors being offered! Seems you can get almost any type of food here. I loved being there and knowing its long history so I recommend doing a little of the same. It was a cold winter afternoon so I bought a cup of mulled wine, walked around the huge complex and took in all the sights and smells.. I enjoyed it thoroughly! ||March 7, 2017
James M||50||There's almost too much going on to write a review on this place. If it isn't on your to-do list in London then it should be.The wide variety of foods, shops, market items, people of all cultures, getting along and sharing such an eclectic place is just a wonderful example of how we can all get along if we just make an attempt to do so.||March 6, 2017
slbuller||50||Stumbled upon this marketplace on one of the three days that it's open to the public. What a market! We were passing through but easily could have spent the entire day. So many vendors offering something for everyone. Can't recommend visiting this enough! ||March 6, 2017
JennyF77||40||If you have a few hours stroll around this market sampling the various foods from around the world, a glass of wine , great atmosphere , this is a vibrant, noisy market that will excite all your senses , its definitely worth a stop on a visit to London ||March 6, 2017
Junogoldsword||40||....Before you visit Borough Market. Unfortunately we had a lunch somewhere else in London before we went to this market. With all the fantastic looking food and the nice smell of food I regretted that I already had lunch somewhere else.The market is busy but it has a nice ambiance. Very pleasant. ||March 6, 2017
Thestudlibancritic||50||People rave about Chelsea Market in New York, but to be honest Borough Market it trounces that place in every way.This is a foodies hot spot, from the breads, to the multitude of veg, through to scotch eggs, burgers (of many flavours) chocolates, butcheries and just about everything else.If you love food get down here ....||March 6, 2017
WMJAB||50||If you are a foodie then Borough Market is thee place for you! A sumptuous delight for the senses and taste buds alike as the latest in food trends, the cultural diversity and the downright tasty converge beneath one large roof for a food fest unlike any other. The bustle of shoppers, browsers and eaters make this a feast for the eyes, the nostrils and the stomach. Sheer food heaven. Visit. ||March 6, 2017
HPCW02||50||Foodie heaven, spoilt for choice, amazing street food. Lovely atmosphere. Handy toilet and limited seating. ||March 6, 2017
91DeniseV||40||This is a lovely place to wander around, soaking up the atmosphere. Lots of delicious food (slightly overpriced!) and a few other bits and pieces. Would definitely recommend if you are in the area. It is very busy so you need a fair bit of patience. Especially nice around Christmas time when you can buy mulled wine and it's all lit up with Christmas lights. ||March 6, 2017
Torparen70||50||Do you like food? Go to Borough Market when in London! Stroll around, taste some cheese, have some lunch. You won't regret it. ||March 5, 2017

OttawaSan||50||We tried the Fish & Chips at Fish Kitchen (cod) - pretty good, crispy batter and old-style thick fries. And, also waited in line at Boston Sausage for a yummy single sausage patty "Boston Burger" with onion marmalade & stilton cheese and a bit of greens. And we also enjoyed the Lemongrass & Ginger Tea at Organic Life Teas (they had run out of their Masala Chai, should have gone earlier :)) - oh and we picked up a savoury pie at the PieMinister (bought cold to have later on - note was 50 pence less to not warm up) and we picked up some fudge - you can get a few pieces mixed and weighed (have since tried some, yummy fresh) - oh and we picked up some cheesecake (beside the tea place) - haven't tried it yet....anyway, lots of food options and a fun place to walk around - though very busy!!!||March 5, 2017
levace||50||We arrived by train, So no parking issues, We love markets, and visit them every time we are abroad.But Nothing can prepare you, for the huge multicultural mix , Its food for everyone, Most of the ready made food seems well priced, Plus the Butchers, Sell cuts of meat, You will NEVER find in supermarkets, Like Hare, Rabbit, Venison & "Proper" Venison sausages, not those rubbish mixed meat ones.Likewise the Bakers, Cheese,,,,Quick stop me ! And vegetable stalls are superb.Well worth a visit,,,,Mid day when ready to eat, otherwise its hard to resist !||March 5, 2017
cookiegonefishing||50||Stayed at London Bridge hotel and decided to visit the market. It's vibrant. Colourful with mouth watering smells. Plenty of choice. Had freshed cooked squid which was superb. Plenty of bars and restaurants surround market. Throughly enjoyed it.||March 5, 2017
StantonJR||50||Borough Mark et is amazing. When it comes to food and drink there is almost nothing that you can't find here. From the mushroom stall to the breads, the vegetables the cheeses, the meats - I could go on all day. Be prepared for massive crowds on almost any day of the week, weekends in particular. Well worth not eating for a week and then sampling all that is on offer both in and around here. Bring a suitcase to stock up on the immense variety of both fresh and jarred food stuffs, or just wander around and marvel at the immense variety of veg, fruit, meat, drinks and other delicacies both English and continental in particular but also further afield. An amazing place and with a good supply of pubs nearby to then just relax and have a drink||March 5, 2017
Christian4||50||Got there at 10am which was perfect, as by the time we were leaving at 1:30pm - you literally couldn't move for the crowds. A wonderful morning spent tasting free samples of wonderful foods and delicacies. Can't wait to go again !! ||March 5, 2017
augen||50||I was a bit disappointed last time that I visited Borough Market, so was really pleased to see a lot of new stalls. I had real trouble choosing what to have for lunch for their is just so much variety now, but ended up picking the pulled roast Herdwick lamb wrap from Cumbrian Speciality Meats, which was absolutely delicious with a tarte au citrone for dessert from a stall selling french pastries. Borough Market isn't the cheapest place to have lunch, but well worth the few extra quid.||March 5, 2017
slimbeau||30||Visited on a Saturday morning and it was buzzing with people. Loads of fresh food and street food as well. The prices are quite expensive if you ask me. Was disappointed by the so called authentic Thai street food. On the other hand another stall selling wrap was fab. I had the fish and prawns wrap.||March 4, 2017
alexsZ7077CH||50||Grateful afternoon out..... Somethings are very very expensive but great cheese downside the ques for food and the prices for a beer||March 4, 2017
ericon991||40||This was a very impressive market, and very busy. It is a covered market so it would be ok on a rainy day. Loved the fact that it is a market that the locals use.||March 4, 2017
EssexPianist||40||Great variety of stalls and wasn't too crowded. Great selection of different types of food. Found a lovely German cake shop for breakfast with really friendly staff.||March 4, 2017
DebbieB575||50||A lovely few hours spent in the VERY busy food market. Watching people, struggling with the crowds!And most importantly eating!!!!There is a taste for everyone. We had lamb filled wraps, a beautiful cocktail, and a sweet dish.Just amazing atmosphere, a real must visit if you are in the area.Highly recommend, but get there early!||March 4, 2017
kristen868||40||When visiting london I would recommend coming here to visit. If you can come during the week when it's less busy would be ideal. Great samples there too! ||March 4, 2017
Zenabelton||50||Short walk from London Bridge station Sights sounds tastes and smell a plenty. Saturday morning a bit crowded but great atmosphere. All stall holders happy and friendly. Recommend chatting to the man selling the borough market bags. Great entertainment. Stalls we visited. Tea 2 you, no question left unanswered plenty of teas to sample we bought jasmine dragon pearl amazing, Italianate for mozerella and Parma ham, and Pice mountain for an excellent array of dried herbs, spices and fruit powders!! The smoked fish stall for smocked trout and tarragon pate - remember to try before you buy!!Make sure you take or buy a bag you are bound to buy something ||March 4, 2017
Daba2010||50||Such a great place to visit! A lot to eat, a lot to try, and a lot to see! Go hungry because the variety is immense! Since it was my first time, I don't know what the best time to visit the market is, but during lunch the place was packed! I will definitely go back!||March 3, 2017
mesh18||50||This market is well worth a visit if you like food. Can get crowded but that's to be expected. Take your choice of foods if you want a quick bite. Or just marvel in all the different fruit and veg.||March 3, 2017
rh24||50||While on extended stays in London I loved to shop here for exotic and local produce as well as host/hostess gifts. There is fresh loose leaf tea, baked goods, pâtés, cheeses, truffle and olive oil to choose from.Then there's the prospect of eating: fresh plump oysters at a stall and/or the multi-ethnic street food offerings. It's also a great place to sample (or take home) British specialties -- fresh pies and fish and chips.However, the one thing that I always do is to head to the Turkish stall to buy Turkish delight (great quality) to take back to the USA.||March 3, 2017
Jiitsuka||50||Just started working 5mins away from here and can feel that I'm either going to become bankrupt or super fat....not sure which one will happen first. Borough Market is amazing, there is so much food here from all over. The permanent shops and stalls at the side sell more things for eating there and then and the ones at the back more for things to take home. Makes me with I lived in London so I could stop off and pick up amazingly fresh veg, meat, fish or cheese. Seemingly its even better on the weekend so if you have never been here before, get hungry, bring some cash (not many take card) and get some good food. ||March 2, 2017
FamFunIllinois||50||Borough Marjet has always been a gem in the city and my most recent visit reconfirmed that. The market continues to evolve and grow in size and selection. Many of the old favorites are still there....borough market olives, Monmouth coffee, Neils, etc. I am not sure there is a better place to spend an early Saturday morning in London. The sites, the smells and the food just take you to another place. Bring bags as there is a lot of choice. I am a big fan of the Spice World......great salts, curries, etc. Will visit it again the next time I am in London. Go early and aim to get out of there by 11:30 because at that point it is packed!||March 2, 2017
NoeB1||50||Here you have a big variety of tasteful street food. Nice atmosphere and fine location. A must visit!!||March 2, 2017
timbog2000||50||Great market and can spend the day walking round the food stalls and into the local pubs. Real foody treat.||March 2, 2017
INM30||50||We had a really good time over there , between cheese vegetables and meat , also some sections for food ready to eat . ||March 2, 2017
JillConnecticut||50||Great selection of food choices although Spitalfields has Ethiopian which is delicious. At 10 AM you can watch them set up. At noon it is getting crowded. On Saturday afternoon it is impassable. Very clean. We walked late one night and they had all the stalls removed and were scrubbing everything down.||March 2, 2017
SoozNorthampton||40||This is definitely one of my favourite food markets, if not the favourite. The wide range of foods from different countries with multiple varieties of even common vegetables means there is always something new. The street food is great but avoid the crowds and get there early to make it easy to get around and have top picks. ||March 1, 2017
rakefeth||50||What a colorful tasty pleasure. Nice cosmopolitic experience. Nice young market, combine it with visiting Tate modern, and come by walking through the millennium bridge.||March 1, 2017
Judycrook||50||I love going here, people watching and tasting the different cuisines available . This time I had a cheese burger from the vegan stall. , it was cooked to order and delicious. Cost £6.50 - was so filling Lots of handmade products available. Different breads and cakes available. Plus great fruit and veg stalls. The cheeses are fantastic too. Well worth a visit just to see the wide range of foods ||March 1, 2017
andyk766||50||When in london, all foodies should go to Borough market. Lots of stalls with food options as well as several bars and pubs for a quick pint between tasting all that the market has to offer.||March 1, 2017
Danii82||40||Visited Borough Markets a few times and whilst it is expensive, it does have a good variety in stalls to suit everyone's tastes. I do prefer the international food markets in Brick Lane as I believe you get more for your money and it is quite 'street food' whilst Borough market gives off the impression of trendy boutique type of foods. You can get everything from homemade brownies, seafood paellas, pies and sausages to sweets and pizza. There is a really lovely winery shop which allows you to dine in and have a snack whilst enjoying a nice glass of white or red. It is good to visit a couple of times for a look and a taste.||March 1, 2017
Mary C||30||Admittedly is was Saturday lunchtime when we visited, but it was so crowded we couldn't get near the stalls and so came away hungry! Great atmosphere in it and will definitely be back - at a less busy time. I'd advise going at off peak.||March 1, 2017
Truck_MG||50||Great array of street food, places to sit under cover, also lots of Stalls selling ingredients. Worth a visit. Walking from Waterloo along the Thames to Borough Market is a great day out. ||February 28, 2017
eatmorechocolate||50||A really good, varied market where it is possible to visit many different stalls with interesting foods and yes! there are some tasters. It can get quite cramped at times but hey, it's fun!||February 28, 2017
B3918IGseanw||50||Whilst smaller than I was expecting, the availability of stalls and eateries was excellent and nothing below outstanding, This really is nice to make a short trip of with plenty to see and do.||February 27, 2017
Ivan Z||40||First visit and a very positive impression. A lot of food stalls, dozens of opportunities for eating and buying quality foods.Street foods, fruits and vegetables that are real rarities.A peculiar London inside the ordinary London.So typical and highly recommended.||February 27, 2017
Betha66||30||We went on a Saturday so we expected the market to be busy but it was ridiculous. There was very minimal seating to be able to sit down and enjoy all the lovely food for sale. The market traders were very rushed and not very friendly. We walked through quite quickly and left as it wasn't a nice atmosphere at all. I am sure if you can go mid week then it would be far more enjoyable. And there really is some yummy food for sale, all be it quite expensive!||February 27, 2017
BrambleK||40||Borough Market used to be awesome, but in the last year it has simply become too busy. Some of the stalls are still great, but getting around, especially at the weekend is hard work!||February 27, 2017
karldesign||40||We had a little walk around the market before a theatre show.We were there mid-morning, taking in the large variety of food and drink stalls.This is great thing to do if you are a foodie. We loved having breakfast stood under the railway with all the hustle and bustle around us.||February 26, 2017
Jeremiah_Joseph||50||Just a short walk from London Bridge this market has everything! A vibrant bustling market full of the finest examples of British and world foods, loads to see and eat! Go hungry as the choices are amazing.||February 26, 2017
karelblonde||50||Excellent encounter with an open minded and spirited market surrounding. Food from all over the globe, surprisingly well presented and energizing. A must see if you have the time to pickup some organic food and other foodie pleasures.||February 26, 2017
Adrob||50||Where do I start the fresh food available is second to none, and the available street food is great. This time I opted for a curry, my dad a fresh venison burger, my partner roast pork and stuffing and my children some freshly cooked pasta. The markets sells lots of British cheeses as well as French, fresh breads, fish, meats, ciders. If you like food and drink you must visit!!||February 26, 2017
tfizzle||40||Love the market experience and the variety of vendors selling both take away and foods that can be prepared at home. Get the 3 euro glass of proseco and stroll at you leisure. ||February 25, 2017
135hazelm||50||I love this place, a real hidden gem full of amazing tastes and smells ready to be experienced. A relaxed friendly atmosphere perfect for families and couples alike.||February 25, 2017
lpmac57||40|| Visiting Borough market was a fun and unique experience that I would highly recommend. There were so many different shops and each offered something fun and different. It was so cool to see so many different cultures represented at the stores. The only downfall was it was incredibly crowded and it was difficult to move around at times. Other than that, it's definitely worth spending some time there!||February 25, 2017
Amanda V||50||Although it was really busy on Saturday, we were so happy we didn't pass up the opportunity to visit and eat at Borough Market. Not only were there plenty of food options, there were also amazing produce shops and boutiques where you could purchase chocolates, jams and other souvenir foodie items.||February 25, 2017
NBLondon||40||There's no disputing the quality of the products available at Borough Market. Lots of choice, friendly service and a great experience. But boy do you pay for it. ||February 25, 2017
waterlily_17_99||50||Love the cheese shops and bakeries. Must try doughnuts from bread ahead place! Salt beef bagel was good, similar to corn beef but saltier. Scottish eggs were good as well! ||February 24, 2017
nickpotteruk1979||50||I love the borough market. If you like good food and you're in London then you have to visit this place.It's got local food and food from all around the world. ||February 24, 2017
Luciano P||40||You can find a broad variety of food, such as cheeses, desserts, burgers, meat, pasta, fruits and vegetables, also from different countries. You'll also find vegetarian/vegan only places.It's hard to leave without spending a pence.||February 24, 2017
lyn2716||50||What a wonderful way to take in the local culture. There are TONs of options for food to eat while you are there and even more options of food and items to take a way with you.||February 24, 2017
Yordanka Y||50||I love this place! It is so vibrant, full with various food stalls, I personally tried the Turkish baklava and the hot chocolate place. Will be visiting again.||February 24, 2017
Carmen N||50||Stopped here on a Saturday morning on our way to the Tower of London and really enjoyed it. Lots of very cute stalls with a little bit of something for everyone. We only bought a few things (Bread Ahead doughnuts cannot be skipped!), but really enjoyed just wandering around.||February 23, 2017
Eve T||50||Excellent variety.. if you go at a non-busy time you can sample different olive oils with bread make sure you arrive hungry as it is primarily a food market! ||February 23, 2017
BereccaM||50||We have been here several times and have never had anything but delicious food. Something for everyone, from pie and mash, hog roast, ethiopian street food, curry and noodles, the only downside would be you will want some of everything! ||February 23, 2017
Sandra F||50||Great place to spend weekend with family. Nice music and great street food. Enjoyed vegan burgers and gluten free brownies the most||February 23, 2017
good2knowit||50||We went there in our first day in London and planned to have lunch but also buy some food for breakfast for the next days. We ended up spending £200 and brought home some delicious souvenirs for family and friends. ||February 23, 2017

Zoo7Zoo||40||Not been to this Market since the early 70s when it was completely different to what you will find now, Its split into 2 areas one serving street food from around the globe and very god it is too,the smells are amazing and the people friendly.The other area has stalls selling a range of up-market foods and ingredients. If you are visiting London you could tie this in with a visit to the Shard as its only 2 minutes down the road.||February 23, 2017
907philt||50||When in London we always find our way to Borough market and are never disappointed. The food is great and they're are dishes to suit everyone. The smell of the market makes you want to explore are eat till you burst. If you visit don't for get to grab a coffee either from Monmouth coffee or flat cap.||February 22, 2017
gwlim||40||Recently I visited this market as recommended by many of the articles I read on the internet. It was crowded with people especially near lunchtime. True to its fame, it certainly is an interesting place to see as a foreign visitor.I was wearing a tight jean and I put my wallet in my backpack, right at the bottom with some clothing on top. I thought nobody would have guess I did that and it would be safe. Some time after going round the stores I noticed my backpack was not fully zipped. I was quite sure I put on the zip properly when I came out from the train station. Sensing something was not right, I checked my bag immediately. True enough, my wallet was seen resting on top of the clothing instead of the original position. On further investigation, I found my Pound Sterling notes were all missing. Fortunately, and to my surprise,the rest of the contents including credit cards ,my country currency notes etc. were all there.I am puzzled at the speed which the pickpockets performed their acts even though I was quite careful all the while and constantly on the alert. I am amazed too that this group of pickpockets could still show some mercy to their victim. Or perhaps they did not have the time to take the rest. Or what ?Anyway, I was quite grateful in a way they took only the Sterling notes. Otherwise my holiday in London would be totally ruined.||February 21, 2017
dheboracoconut||50||This is eventually one of my favs in London, chaotic but not too much, colourful and with a lot of delicious goods. You'll surely find something very good to eat (and drink), whatever your taste is.||February 21, 2017
YorkshireTraveller14||50||Borough Market has an amazing selection of restaurants and street food, and is a fantastic location for a reasonably priced lunch. While the vendors will vary, look out for Indian vegetarian food like dosas and great meat dished, wraps and burgers. A nearby bakery supplies a lot of the bread and baked goods. This is a must-visit destination if you're in Southwark.||February 20, 2017
rayrest||50||This was a wholesale fruit and veg market which date back to 1756. Very popular food market that sells fresh meats and fine foods to locals and tourists. Worth a look inside.||February 20, 2017
AndyA104||50||Fantastic place with a great atmosphere and range of food for everyone!Well worth a visit,just catch the tube to London Bridge,carry on through the Market along the Thames to the Globe and Tate Modern cross back over the river and head for Covent Garden and Leicester Square. A great days sightseeing guaranteed!||February 20, 2017
Newcastleuk||40||We love visiting the market when we are in London and if the weather is good you can eat a barbecue sandwich at the cafes and bars opposite the Cathedral and can sit and have a beer or a sangria.||February 20, 2017
TravelLove717||50||Not bad prices at all and an abundance of food/drink options. I suggest you go when you haven't eaten at all, so you can have three meals here :) Find cheese, wine, beer, bread, bakery items, juices, coffees, pastas, fish, etc here. I wish I had stayed longer and been hungrier!||February 20, 2017
HennyG524||40||This is a great market but was extremely busy on a Friday lunchtime. Great range of stalls and foods. The sights and smells are amazing. Definitely worth a visit but maybe avoid Friday lunchtimes as the crowds were slightly uncomfortable.||February 20, 2017
SingleMan50ish||40||If you want some Saturday Lunch street food, then come here and get a vegetarian thali. It was lovely, but you need to queue and like crowds!||February 20, 2017
Jackyjumpers||30||Walked through the market on Friday morning as part of a tour and it looked and smelt really good. When back for a proper visit on Saturday afternoon and you could hardly move around the place. Sadly this really took any enjoyment away as you couldn't really see what most of the stands were selling. Would maybe try again but definitely on a Thursday or Friday.||February 20, 2017
730MarcB||40||A busy food oriented market in central London. Very high quality street food... the venison burger is a must! One of the best burgers we've experienced... slight problem tho, this is our staple choice on our visit and based on experience / expectations we will not try anything else!Great atmosphere, tastes and smells... a place to go on any visit to London.||February 19, 2017
SteveH870||40||This is mainly a food market but one of some size with a very wide choice on offer. There's all the usual's such as burgers and sausages but also some less often found cuisines on show. If you're hungry you'll be spoilt for choice and virtually all the traders were happy to offer a sample before you parted with your cash...As with many of these types of market some of the prices do raise eyebrows and you can easily go through £30 if there are four of you all wanting a burger yet you will also find many items not seen elsewhere...all in all a fun way to spend an hour or so.||February 19, 2017
Lynn T||50||You could spend hours here and eat from food from all over the world. Its close to London Bridge train station making it easily accessible.||February 19, 2017
Janet276||50||Bacon roll from Roast takeaway - delicious, washed down with a glass of prosecco rose - beautiful, followed by a Scotch Egg - to die for .......what more does anyone want in life ||February 18, 2017
mfr1991||50||Went for a bit of lunch and was floored by the selection and quality! It was really cold so I didn't get around to half of the stalls I wanted to but the ones I did were so cool! Yummy food (I'd recommend the Mac n Cheese wth pulled pork!) and something for everyone. Great selection of desserts (cheesecake!) too. So many delicious smells and fun bits of quality crafts and artwork too for sale. Really awesome layout and overall fab experience.||February 18, 2017
TomK84||50||I've shopped in traditional markets in many countries and this one is just top notch. With a 1000 year history and an amazing array of goods you simply need to spend an hour or two here. Great food choices and an opportunity to try some wonderful things. Come hungry!!||February 18, 2017
angela s||10||Haven't been here for awhile, but it's gone down hill. I'm no food snob, but the hygiene of the vendors left a lot to be desired. Guess others are braver than us.....I'd say move on down to the hays galleria.||February 18, 2017
chrisdK8517YI||50||I am lucky that our lawyers offices are right next to the market so carefully timed meetings mean being able to grab lunch from the mind blowing array of vendors.This trip it was salt beef bagels that caught our eyes with all the trimmings.There is nothing better that someone who cares as much about creating your snack as you do eating it.Love it.||February 18, 2017
Gemma B||50||This place is fantastic you can buy and eat ready made fresh produce from all the different market stalls the place gets very busy and its full of buzz ||February 18, 2017
Di S||40||Have never been to the market before and was totally amamzed and what they had even though it was mid week. Vendors were always so willing to chat to you and explain things.||February 18, 2017
Westcott||50||We travel at least four times a year to Borough Market to stock up on the wonderful cheese, bread and savouries and the market offers a lot more.Neals Yard, just off the market, has an amazing stock of British cheeses. The staff are extremely knowledgable and courteous and offer samples to ensure your purchase suits.Go in the morning if you want to avoid the crowds.||February 18, 2017
Z3209AAbrunos||40||This is a wonderful market when you can see all the stalls and have time to look at the offerings.Unfortunately the weekends are not a good time for that as there are thousands of people who come; many apparently for the first time, and stand mainly looking, but not actually buying produce.On the other hand the market always has very good offerings, often at good prices and is certainly worth a visit anytime.Fabulous cheeses, spices, meats, fruits and vegetables, baked goods, and much much more.Highly recommended.||February 18, 2017
Silver1784||40||It's for everyone. Borough Market has it all.One of my favorite places in London to try various types of food. If you are a foodie, the Borough Market is truly a treat. The Hog Roast here is fabulous and so as the oysters. You get a true spirit of London here. Buying fresh produce from local farmers and freshly prepared food here is an experience.||February 18, 2017
onabitt||50||We went to this market on a Saturday around noon, found out there that it is open until 17:00 and it's not open on Sundays.The market has a huge number of different food stands, the smells and tastes are great and very inviting to try everything.We tried a fish wrap, a fish soup, special black pasta with crabs and mushroom sauce and more, all were amazing, while we were full we kept on eating.We then crossed over the street to the section which has the "green market" title and found all of the sweet stands, with a wide range of choices and tastes this too was amazing.Highly recommended, we also had the mulled wine and fresh drinks (apples and pears).The experience was a very memorable one, strongly suggest to come hungry and willing to walk around, there are some small lines in certain places but they are all worth it and not that long.||February 17, 2017
zammy111||50||Whether you're a foodie, not too bothered about food and only eat because you have to, or somewhere in between, Borough Market is for you! The food is fresh, yummy, diverse and tempting... the aromas alone have the ability to take you on a mental journey to far away places! And all this in a wonderfully historic part of London. An absolute delight. You just have to LOVE Borough Market.||February 17, 2017
NinjaTurtle74||50||We loved Borough Market! We couldn't believe we had not been there before after lots of visits to the big smoke! We even lived there! The 'street food' was absolutely gorgeous and we fell in love with "Neil's cheese yard" There was a wonderful atmosphere and it will definitely be part of any visit we make to London. ||February 17, 2017
isabelkatejones||50||Such a happy place, had musicians playing, wonderful food stores and easy station access.Hardest part is deciding which food to get. ||February 16, 2017
Yukari M||50||What an exciting and buzzing place with lots of delicious food to try! We went there on Saturday lunchtime so obviously it was very busy but that didn't stop us having fun.||February 16, 2017
DanMitt||40||Whether you go there as a tourist as we did or actually go shopping there, Borough Market will not disappoint you! There is an absolutely amazing diversity of food and drinks, and most vendours offer you to taste whatever you want, or you simply try one of the plates with bites of delicacies on. People are very friendly and open minded, we had an absolutely unplanned 30min chatwith a seller of chutneys and jam...so it's not also good food but also nice to get to know English people!||February 16, 2017
fabersan||50||you can have good food or bed, it is a very central market and very touristic, close to the famous Shard, if you look around you can find good things to eat, not so cheap but it is worth it a walk here ...creamy bombs, cheese, ethnic food, fresh fish, oyster and more...||February 16, 2017
gregsP212AO||50||If you are unsure what food you want then head here as there is so much choice !Amazing fresh fish and vegetables ...A bonus is that it's right next door to The Market Porter - a great pub||February 15, 2017
606zoet||40||Such fun and yummy eats! Such diverse outlets for street food and the market stalls selling fresh fish,meat and veg and spices! Truly worth a visit ||February 15, 2017
JAWS2||50||my son now lives near London so we went down to visit him. We have been on the south bank a few times but never knew about the market until Craig took us. I love my food and cheese and olives and fish What a great place fresh cooked food in front of your eyes. A choice from anywhere in the world and without doubt value for money. The smells and aromas are mouth watering from now on when ever i am in the Big City i know where to go for a great value lunch. Try it folks it is worth every penny||February 15, 2017
BethanBannister||50||Lovely market with so many different stalls, I wanted to buy everything. Lots of food to try then and their and we have dinner sorted as well. Everyone was so friendly and it's full of love. ||February 15, 2017
jantyk2014||50||If you love trying different foods and being able to buy different spices, meats, cheeses, oils and so on then this is the place for you. It can get very busy with tourists, proving the area is a victim of its own success. Great street food and also good restaurants, bars and stalls.||February 15, 2017
2Go0rNot2Go||50||Having been several times I wonder if I'll ever get bored of this place, a definite must go if you in London and looking for something to do. Whether you just want to have a wonder round, or fancy something to eat or drink there's something for everyone. Either eat off one of the street stalls or go to a bar/restaurant. Pick up a snack or main meal, carry a drink around with you or take some pictures. This time we went a bit earlier than usually and it's was less chaotic, so if your not keen on the hustle and bustle go early. We ate this time at Whiskey Ginger and had the most amazing chicken ginger, cheese and bacon burger and chips. Be aware lots of the bars/restaurants have hidden away little places you can sit one level up which gives you a great view over the markets. Also there are lots of free tasting going on if you can't make your mind up! Definitely worth a visit. Enjoy.||February 15, 2017
Sarah C||50||We went for a casual Friday afternoon mooch and lunch date... we were spoilt for choice for all the wonderful Street food stalls on offer. They all looked and smelled amazing. Opted for the vegi curry stall, great choice. Boarded the train home laden with all sorts of delicious foods for dinner too... equally as amazing. Love this place!||February 14, 2017
LVFRAZIER||50||I adore this market! I stop by daily for my snacks and meals to heat up in the rented flat. Varieties of food around the world, dessert, and many other selections blows my mind. Duck sandwich and Scotch eggs are a few of my favorites.||February 14, 2017
Tono511||40||The market is located south of the river, so if you plan to go I would recommend you to start in Saint Paul Cathedral and walk from there crossing the Millenium Bridge and visiting the Modern Art Museum as you go by. When you reach the market the first thing you will notice is that you will find at least one food stand of each continent. This place is definitely a reflection of modern day London, with people of all over the world and their food represented there. Of course as you walk inside you will see some stands that offer more traditional english flavors, but the place is mixture of many cultures. For the food, there are so many options that it is imposible to try them all in just one visit. The best you can do is to walk all over the market and after choose what would you like to try and start from there.||February 14, 2017
AnaZ650||40||Is a good place to visit even if you don't intend to buy anything, there are so many options, tastes and smells, and one of the best fish & chips I had in the city.||February 14, 2017
Marfa_MF||50||Borough Market is a must when visiting London. Take an empty stomach and a heavy shopping bag, as you will want to take home fresh cheeses, olive oils, vinegar, jams and sauces. You can smell the food stalls blocks away. Excellent way to spend a few hours, especially lunch time. There is a handful of tea shops and cafes to sit and enjoy the view whilst resting your full belly.||February 14, 2017
Ox1dus||50||An awesome market to find everything from haggis, local sausages, mulled wine, goat cheese, oysters, and much more. Remember to visit with an appetite! ||February 13, 2017
NCA-Istanbul||40||I say this is London,old and new just side by side...must see place.There is a lot of cafes and I believe you will enjoy it especially in spring or summer.||February 13, 2017
Neris123||50||I live close by and shop here at least twice a week. Love the cheese, bread, fish..... there aren't any good cakes sadly, but great for savoury. Both the fish shops are good (Fish & Applebees) the various food stands selling lunch smell delicious, but I haven't eaten there.||February 13, 2017
trev1uk||40||Borough Market should be on every foodie's list of places to visit. As well as the huge range of fruit, fish, meat & vegetables, there are lots of artisan stalls. You can buy fresh hot food from inside and around the market and try lots of different cuisines. Overall, prices are not particularly cheap compared to street markets but can still be good value. The immediate area around the market has pubs and food stalls & local residents and office workers eat and drink here....always a sign of a good venue. You could spend a good couple of hours walking around the market and enjoying what's on offer - longer if you stop for lunch.If you really fancy treating yourself, you could visit the Roast Restaurant. Very good food, moderately priced, and well worth it.||February 13, 2017
Debi G||40||This market was just crawling with local flavor. Booths everywhere packed with vendors hawking all kids of goods||February 13, 2017
Holidaygal62||40||Lovely to walk around and plenty to see and eat. Make sure you wrap up warmly if you are going in Winter. Had a wonderful hot roast pork and apple sauce sandwich, which was so big I shared it with my husband.||February 13, 2017
Dennis C||50||A great place to visit and have a wander around looking at all of the food stalls, some really good speciality stalls and food being cooked to cover all tastes.The atmosphere is really nice and the smells will definitely make you hungry.Well worth a visit!||February 13, 2017
Richard B||50||This is a time honoured market with an eclectic choice of street and other foods. You will find a large selection of ethnic foods plus very well cocked English favorites. I always plan a walking visit to Tower Bridge, HMS Belfast Borough Market for lunch then onto The Globe Theatre and finish at St. Paul's.||February 13, 2017
jeffreysD6201WX||50||If you're in London for any reason and if you're into food in any way, there's no reason to not stop by Borough Market. Fresh veg, gourmet eateries, specialty food, wine, and cheese shops, and a wonderful food truck/stall area with all manner of cuisines from around the world. Some highlights:Just a 1/2 block away is Neal's Yard Dairy specializing in British cheeses. Hundreds of wheels of cheese from every part of the UK can be sampled and bought in any quantity! The staff is super knowledgeable and friendly. We even got a recommendation for afternoon tea! And they helped find it on their computer with Google Maps. Brindisa - Specializing in Spanish foods, they have a variety of Spanish hams, Ibèrico and Serrano, that they hand carve right in the shop. You can taste them as they carve and buy them packaged next to the ham that was just sliced!Elsey & Bent is a wonderful grocery stall with beautiful fruits and vegetables. But do buy some of the dried dates. They get some of the best dates I've ever had. Soft, sweet, succulent... so good!In Southwark near London Bridge. Easy Underground access at London Bridge station, Borough High Street exit.

Fugare1||50||Fresh bread galore, cheese and delectables everywhere you look and a huge variety of street food. I must take a bigger bag when I'm in London next so I can take more home. A great market with a massive array of excellent foods.||February 13, 2017
217lucyc||50||Excellent market with loads to try and see. Mainly food but some other bits too. I loved the cheese stalls and I bought some delicious French cheese.||February 12, 2017
John B||50||From J Boy of DerbyMy favourite London market it heaves with the crowds at weekends,and the atmosphere is electric.Dozens of stalls under one roof selling food from all over the world to wander round is like being in an overseas market.Stallholders competing with each other over prices, the smell of different burgers being sold.On top of that there are several good pubs, one on the market itself and others round the edge.Toilets are a bit naff, but go enjoy, as in any large crowd watch your pockets though.||February 12, 2017
JohnnyGPortsmouth||40||Wandered around here for 1/2 an hour marvelling at all the wonderful food available form artisan cheeses, fresh fish, vegetables, locally sourced drinks and a mass of other foods. A little expensive but would be lovely to shop there once in a while.||February 12, 2017
Mick D||40||What a hive of activitie the place is bustling food from all around the world and all corners of this country if you are looking for something a little bit different then take a look around this remarkable place ||February 12, 2017
linneatormajer||50||Wanting a day out in London avoiding the usual places and tourist trail we decided to head to Borough Market to try something new. I am so glad we did. What a gem of a place for foodies, people watching and taking in the sights and smells of every different type of food and drink you can think of.This place is packed to the rafters with sweet and savory delights to eat there or take home with you. We particularly enjoyed the Turkish Deli and bought a huge amount of Turkish Delight to enjoy at home but also had some freshly made Turkish coffee at their seating area while watching the world go by hurrying through the snow..a truly magical moment.We also sampled cheese , liquorice, chocolate and artisan breads as well as having fresh oysters with Prosecco for a pretty valentines day treat. All the traders we chatted to were lovely and happy to let us sample their products.A totally unique morning and we loved it. Will be returning when the weather warms up to do it all again ..well worth a visit. ||February 11, 2017
RLC1984||40||Lots of stalls and food outlets to wander around and people watch. Prepare yourself for large crowds - you just have to go with them! Was particularly nice post Christmas but I imagine there is a great atmosphere most weekends. Great little shops for Indian spices and loose leaf tea. Also lots of nice sugary baked goods!||February 11, 2017
DDooner||50||If you like markets you will love the Borough Market. It has an incredible range of food. The place was buzzing when we visited. We walked there from Tower Bridge. There are also a selection of restaurants and bars that you can choose from. I would highly recommend a visit when in London.||February 11, 2017
PHILIP and JULI... P||50||This was an experience any 'foodie' would love. You can find anything from strange looking vegetables and tropical fruits, to specialty beer and whiskey. There is every type of cheese imaginable, compotes, teas, flavored vinegars and oils...just everything! And the street food!! The very smell of it will make you HUNGRY. But that's okay, because you can try the awesome cuisine from any of the vendors there. The difficult thing is making the decision about which to try first!||February 10, 2017
Jordan A||50||Borough market is a fantastic place for food lovers and as an attraction in London, it is up there with some of the must sees.The sheer variety of food available is a sight to behold with stalls ranging from loose teas and cupcakes to paella and Bosnian desserts. All in all it is a thorough recommendation to check out and regardless of tastes, there will certainly be something of attraction there.||February 10, 2017
Alice W||40||If you can, go there on a Saturday lunch : it buzzing and joyful and smells amazing ! Hard to pick only one meal, there's so much appetising choice ! Loads of people tho, but it is really easy to go out, take a break and go back again. ||February 10, 2017
veronica b||50||So much to look at what a wide variety of food to choose from and all the different foods very interesting place to visit and buy unusual food stall holders very polite.||February 10, 2017
mandy h||40||The only problem with this place is deciding what to eat. There is great variety here and lots of fresh produce.||February 9, 2017
FamTraveler38||50||Breakfast, lunch and dinner - all can be met here. There are cafes and restaurants on the edges of the market, plus many food stalls within the market. If purchasing from a food stall, beware there are few seats or other places to consume your food. You may need to eat as you stroll around the market.||February 9, 2017
DSFMEC||50||Arrive hungry, as there is so much in the way of delectable food, and atmospher. A melting pot of cultures and cuisine.The freshest, finest, and most unique food market I have been to. Some vendors offer samples (I'm looking at you, paella man), while others do not. Tried a Scotch egg for the first time. I am glad we were able to make this stop.||February 9, 2017
Walaiphan C||40||Simple bfast. lots of cheeses . First time here . Hi-end wet market Recommended to visit for food n cheese ||February 9, 2017
KEP12538||50||When we walked down the stairs from London Bridge, the smells hit your senses well before the sites and what a great way to be initiated into this market/eatery!If there is a map of the market, we didn't find one but it was rather easy to retrace our steps to find our favorite items to sample.The displays of fresh and prepared items rival the beauty of the Rue de Boucher in Brussels and made us really enjoy our choices as simple and yummy as fish and chips to the always decadent goats milk ice cream atop a fresh waffle!This is certainly the place for foodies and for the family shopping for fresh veggies; a must see and do on the London bucket list!!!||February 8, 2017
Izzy T||50||Definitely make a trip here if you're visiting London. The stalls and the atmosphere feels really special and the large variety of cuisines is something very unique to London. There's mild lack of seating but having to stand up and look at the church next door isn't exactly a problem. For a cheap but tasty meal... head down! Highly recommend!||February 8, 2017
luigicam||50||Must visit this place if you around the neighbourhood. Ethnic food, Mediterranean, breads, desserts, coffees and more is available trough out the day||February 8, 2017
Marwa1985||50||If you're into food markets and street food then you should definately go! The market has everything you could think of, from spices to cheese to international dishes. Everything! It's such a fun experience to just walk around the market even without buying anything.||February 8, 2017
Tommy M||50||One of the "must see", food speaking, in London. The atmosphere is great thanks to fragrances and flavors from all over the world. Very easy to reach, is the perfect place for a fast, different and funny lunch! Opening time: Monday and Tuesday from 10am to 5pm (limited market), from Wednesday to Saturday from 10am to 5pm (full market). London Bridge station (by tube Jubilee and Northern lines).||February 7, 2017
JuneauMan||50||Went here on a Monday and enjoyed the less crowded, more enjoyable feel of the place. Explored various nooks and crannys, had several tastings and tried several samples. Nice way to get a cheap lunch with so many different favors!||February 7, 2017
Creditman0||50||spent my summer holidays staying in Southwalk at my mothers so was familiar with 1970s market, but a world away from that era. now a tourist destination with bustling atmosphere and varied and exciting produce available. a great place to spend a couple hours browsing and sampling the wares. ||February 7, 2017

sarahsL1283NM||50||OMG - my husband is a big foody and didn't know which way to turn first! We could have spent a full day here sampling everything. All the stalls we approached were very friendly and informative. Will definitely be coming again with friends and no children to try the alcoholic side of it all!!||February 5, 2017
James E||50||Stopped in for a haircut and a beard trim and had a fantastic, good value haircut and beard trim. The bald barber is a really nice guy and made the whole thing less of a chore which getting a trim can sometimes be.||February 4, 2017

Kerrymh2017||30||I am not a big fan of open markets, but I thought i would see what all the great reviews were about. It was extremely crowded. I don't think the people working the stalls were very friendly. The food lines were so long, I decided not to wait. ||February 1, 2017
chipbee123||40||Love this market! Filled me with a lot of surprises! Highly recommend to visit at least once! Food is vastly available and it comes in huge variety! ||February 1, 2017
WesB553||50||My wife and I decided to head to Borough Market for lunch after spending the morning at the British Museum. The market is convenient to the tube, with two nearby stations. The market is busy and has lots of stalls selling unique items. There are also lots of stalls selling prepared food that smells delicious. If you are looking for an eclectic lunch or to lick up some items for breakfast, I would recommend spending an hour or so browsing Borough Market. ||February 1, 2017
kdw72||50||Nice place to wander round and look at the offerings from all the different stalls. Some high quality artisan goods as well as great looking meat and veg. Great opportunities to grab a drink and nibble at food from various stalls. Picked up some saucisson today, the duck version is great. Definitely worth wandering round and taking in the atmosphere, the Thames is just around the corner for you to walk along and shed the gained calories!!||February 1, 2017
LVRick||50||I stopped by and enjoyed the variety of food offerings there and found it a nice stop for lunch. You should meander around first before choosing, the variety is huge. Most items are reasonably priced and a great stop for a different type of lunch.||February 1, 2017
JaneHardin06||50||If you love outdoor markets and food this is not to be missed!This market offers a feast for the eyes and stomach. You can buy all manner of fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, meat and wine. Wander though the stalls and even eat at one of the many food venders selling their diverse specialties! We never miss coming to this Market each time we visit London. It is a must-do!||February 1, 2017
Rubaiyat E S||40||This is one of the top gourmet market and you will find everything from vegetables to truffle oil. Even if you do not need anything still you will end up with buying a lot of stuffs. You will be mesmerised with the the food quality and appearances. You can spend 3-4 hours just wandering around. You will get squash blossoms over there.You can have a nice meal or a quick bite over there. The cooking aromas will force you to have them. It could be really busy on some hours so choose your visiting time wisely and bring your shopping bag with you.||February 1, 2017
MiriamHK||50||Great delicious food finds. Make sure you get some cheese sticks and donuts from Bread Ahead right in front of the entrance to Borough Market as well as their Duck Confeit Sandwich. There are other scrumptious finds like Scotch Eggs, homemade fudge, pulled pork which will interest the hungry traveller||January 31, 2017
kennyv2016||50||Never seen a better market then Borough Market. Especially on Saturday you get an unbelievable vibe on this market with food from all around the world. The market is just nice to visit as an tourist and also a place for a nice lunch. The places around the market are really good restaurants, bistro's and coffee bars. You bet I will come back!! ||January 31, 2017
wwwanchi||50||Forget Disneyland ;)Borough Market had all kinds of delicious food from all over the world in one place. It's deliciously fantastic! A must-try!||January 31, 2017
manm2014||50||Borough Market, to me, encapsulated everything that is great about London - the people, the food, the creativity, the vibrant intermingling of old and new. I thoroughly enjoyed myself - browsing the different vendors and trying new foods. I highly recommend Gourmet Goat for the kofta pita & Greedy Goat Ice Cream for the banoffee pie shake. Both - smashing. It just so happened that my visit was a goat type of day.||January 30, 2017
lokyig||50||This is the one place you have to go when you visit London or if you live here. Unless you hate good food. This place is full of good food and they are fresh, high quality, authentic and delicious. This is a foodie paradise and the atmosphere is so good. Saturday you get the best variety of food but then you get a horrible crowd with it. Anyway, this is definitely my favorite place to go in London and I bring friends there every time someone visiting from other country. I only write review either it is amazingly impressive or abysmally sh*. Borough market is definitely great. I have to specially mention the mix fish and prawns wraps from applebee . They changed totally my view of wraps and I have one every time I go to borough market. Inarguably the best wraps in London, not just tasty but the value of money, such big pieces of prawns and fish and the freshness! Every and each bite is another big mouthful of seafood. Just something to kill for. Agreed by everyone I brought with me and I'm a known foodie.||January 30, 2017
AqueenHotel||30||This Market only sells fruits, vegetables and drink. Fruits are fresh even vegetables are fresh. Clean environment. Sellers are attentive and good communication to buyers.||January 30, 2017
MJMCD67||50||Have been here a few times, and love the variety of food and smells and sights - a great food market. But it does get pretty full on in the weekend - so try and hit it during the week in the morning if you can. Worth it. Not too huge - but plenty to fill your shopping bags with.||January 30, 2017
WilliamYaw||50||Variety selection of great food, veg and drinks. Sea urchin is worth to try and fresh delicious oyster!||January 30, 2017
Markus-NI||50||Being a foodie, Borough Market is one of my favorite spots in London. It has a large variety of food stalls for all different types of taste, including exotic stuff such as grilled crocodile or zebra, you also can get very good coffee and a great selection of ciders. So - if you like food: Go there! :)||January 30, 2017
phillip n||50||As a Head Chef I'm always looking for something new, Fresh products, great tasting food. For any Chef borough market is the place to go. There our some great stalls, Great ideas give it ago.||January 29, 2017
Glos01||50||Having never been to Borough Market previously I was unsure what to expect. The market is within easy walking distance of London Bridge and a delightful place to visit. The smells and flavours of the various foods sends your sense of smell and taste buds reeling. I would say that if you can't find the food that you want here then it doesn't exist! So much choice. A brilliant couple of hours well spent.||January 29, 2017
BalthasarGracian||40||A market that suits foodies. Plenty of cheese for sale. A great variety of streetfood on offer from German Bratwursts to vegan burgers with everything in between including Ethiopian, hog roast, scotch eggs, noodles, pie and mash, wraps, Indian, and soul food. ||January 29, 2017
Onourwa||50||What a gem of a place. Lots to see and eat at this unique market. Fresh fish, vegetables and fruit. Spices from around the world .... a must see||January 29, 2017
Andrea H||50||Foodies will adore this place for its abundance, delicious options, spices, produce and local purveyors. Really worth seeing. Definitely try the racklette...Melty cheese over potatoes, topped with cornichon pickles. You won't leave hungry. ||January 28, 2017

stuartarmstrong12||50||We spent a couple of hours here with the kids, it's a great way to encourage them to broaden their food horizons. Even my fussiest eater couldn't resist a crocodile burger. Great fun and worth making a regular stop on London trips.||January 28, 2017
armytalker||50||It was my first time visit to borough market. Located near the london bridge tube station its only a short walk to the market. Arrived at the market you dont know where to start your journey so i decided to take a fresh juice and walk throuh the market. You can find different kinds of fresh food excellent if you live in london or if you have access to a kitchen. If not, don't worry there's enough street food freshly made for you. I tried a cheese and olive stick and a salt beef sandwich as a starter. Then continued to the ethiopian flavour stall for lunch. As dessert i decided to try a chocolate brownie and a white chocolate chip cookie. It was all worth the price. So if yiu are in london even for a short stay do not miss a visit to the borough market. You won't regret it.||January 27, 2017
S4549YSdanielb||50||If you're a foodie you'll love this place. Great selection of English and international food ( Italian and French especially well represented). Good place to hangout enjoy the ambience and to sample the food. Lots of stalls offering free samples of cheese and meat plus there are good restaurants and bars in the area. There are also some good wine stalls as well offering tastings.The food here isn't cheap as it's all about provenance and quality. However.....if you turn up on Saturday around about 4pm there are bargains to be had especially in the fish stalls!It's not a great place for young kids and if you have them with you and you want to visit I'd make it at lunchtime or on your way home. In that way you can either eat at the market or pick up some food to eat at home.It is very close to the tate modern and it's especially nice to combine these two as a day out.||January 27, 2017
936annettecgdcp||50||A fabulous market which I visit often. Excellent for foodies to buy ingredients, for a snack or a night out. Somthing for everyone||January 27, 2017

savannahexplorer||50||There is so much happening at Borough Market it is not possible to review it all at one go so I will not try and instead focus on my favourites. Wyndham' s Fresh Chicken Wraps & Burgers/ Brindisa Chorizo Wyndham have their own free range chicken farm and serve delicious chicken burgers with salsa and rocket for £5 which I normally have as a Friday treat . The chicken is minced thickly and I love the taste of actual chicken which is delicious. Alternatively, you can have a chicken wrap as the more healthy option which is crammed with chicken breast meat and goes for £6 . This is equally delicious.£5 will also buy you a double chorizo with 2 sweet red peppers drizzled with extra virgin olive oil in a bun from Brindisa who have an international reputation for high quality Spanish foods. This is a smaller meal compared with the chicken but just as delicious. The chorizo is probably the best grilled chorizo I have eaten outside of Andalusia. Both highly recommended- healthy Gourmet lunches. I work in London Bridge and can ascertain to the high quality of both establishments based on dozens of visits over the years. ||January 26, 2017
53staciem||50||I'm so glad that I managed to find time to head over to the Borough Market before I left London. It is an outdoor market that showcases almost any type of food you can think of--from cheeses, to chocolates, to nuts, to fish, there's a little bit of everything there. The smells were amazing and so were the free samples. If I hadn't been leaving the next day, there's no telling how much I might have bought! The market itself has been on that spot, in one form or another, for over 1000 years--making it a neat little piece of history sitting right at the end of London Bridge.||January 26, 2017
Rosie L||50||A fantastic food market with lots of choice & atmosphere. Had THE best salt beef sandwich ! If I lived nearby I'd be there everyday ||January 26, 2017

95nikop||50||We came here early in the morning as it was just opening. There was plenty of stores open and the food smelt and tasted it great. There was a lot of fresh food and you could see the quality. It wasn't cheap but it was worth spending the time to come here and experience it all.||January 25, 2017
Traveling91012||50||I could easily spend a good part of a day here just food shopping and eating. There is a huge variety of foods and small shops. There are savory foods as well as cakes and sweets. The market is split in two, with a small road separating the two sides. We ended up eating a duck confit sandwich and it was FABULOUS. We also bought some things that we can't get at home, such as different duck pâtés and a ton of spices. I will definitely go here again and I would recommend it to a friend. ||January 24, 2017
Yegor6||30||Doesn't seem to be 'raw' like it used to be. Felt more like a real market before. Now seems to have evolved into a tourist destination with lots of cooked food stalls but not a fresh organic food market per se. Maybe I'm getting old and nostalgic. Maybe not.||January 24, 2017
paulos168||50||Markets are always great places to visit when on vacations. The colours, the smells, the sounds of people working, selling, preparing food... Every single thing is a discover. Borough Market is not an exception. Get lost in the alleys fulled of tiny stalls and shops. Experience the multicultural tastes. Talk with sellers, make some pictures... and eat one of the many meals available.||January 24, 2017
M P||50||Search and you will find. One of my favourite stalls is the Mersey Island.Straight from the sea, the most delicious, sweet, moist and flavoursome oysters and clams.They also serve two kinds of white wine. I suggest Picpoul to be the best accompaniment.Wander around the corner and there's even more crustacians to be explored and all reasonably priced.Now for me, I was over the moon when I suddenly spied Sea Urchins! Oh what an unusual seafood. A very unusual taste, good for you as well. I love them with lemon and salt, just like a cerviche. The taste lasts for hours.Another special treat and also good for you but hard to buy is fresh, raw milk and yoghurt. The bacteria is fantastic for your gut enzymes. Try what is best for you.Vegetables galore and fresh cheeses and bread are also a gastronomies delight.||January 24, 2017
Sam W||50||loveddddddd the food.So much to choose from. This definitely deserves a few visits, just so you can try everything! The food below and the 'sausage stand' were amazing!Great day||January 24, 2017
eawdooley||50||Wow what an incredible place, try to visit on a Friday lunch time, the place is so alive, packed with so many people from all over the world, try hot food stalls not cheap but amazing food. Don't miss Neals yard dairy even if you don't like cheese you have to see this place, try the many drinks on offer many do not include alcohol. Fully accessible on a Friday can be a bit difficult to move around due to numbers. Enjoy||January 24, 2017
993issya||50||You have to love Borough Market. If you are a foodie then you must go there. Prices are expensive but you are in Borough market and this is London after all. Borough market is the closest thing I have in London to 'Spanish pub crawling', Saturday is the 'big' day but you also get all the crowd. Great place to chill on a Saturday morning! ||January 23, 2017
dwkswnt||50||best to visit the market around lunch time.. lots of great food stalls, the bakeries are great although expensive... love the ambiance of this market so much..||January 22, 2017

okiesooner09||40||We were in London for only a few days and were unable to attend the market when it was fully open. But even on one of the off days, there are still a lot of booths open and quite a bit to see. We munched on a few snacks and talked with some of the vendors. Even on a slow day there weren't a lot of places to sit and eat. I can't imagine what it would be like on a busy day.||January 22, 2017
BJLsMundo||50||If your looking for a great food experience, make sure to stop at the Borough Market. This is when I wish I was a local so I could keep coming back and experiencing all the food stalls. From great meats, sandwiches, and cheeses, to good deserts, this place has it all. 100% recommend this place....come hungry and leave happy!||January 22, 2017
Notfaro||40||Walked here from a visit to the Shard. What a fantastic array of food stuffs. Want to come back and taste lots. (Had just eaten at the Aqua Shard.) Loved the spices & chillies. It's true we do use our sense of sight before taste when tempted by food. Mind you the smells were totally amazing. Oh the bread, the coffees. Will be coming back with my foodie husband. ||January 22, 2017
Rounsie||50||The cab driver told me to come here. It was brilliant. So much good food, tastings freely available. Lots of fresh and prepared produce. The pus still pulls beer, the old fashioned way, great beers on tap. Great atmosphere, everyone just out to enjoy. Plenty of things for lunch too. Worth a visit, include the pub.||January 22, 2017

erdibirdyy||50||In the words of the great Luther Vandross, "Oh my love, a million days in your armsIs never too much, I just don't wanna stopNever too much, never too muchNever too much, never too much"Seriously though, you can never get too much at the Borough Market. It's not overhyped or excessive, but every visit feels like the first. Fresh seafood, oozing raclette, salt beef, good coffee, spices, and so much more. Never too much. ||January 21, 2017
Tkjuliet||50||This higher scale market is almost as busy as Brick Lane; interesting smells and also vendors encouraging passer-byes to try their wares.Many stalls sell good cheeses and we bought a strong ripe brie. We liked a stall selling truffle oil and also another selling 3 different kinds of oysters at 2 to 3 pounds each.We lunched at a burger cafe and topped our visit at another cafe specialising in delicious hot chocolate; ideal for a cold winter day. Well worth the visit.||January 21, 2017
Ada_Ubrezi||50||A wide spectrum of whatever meal your heart desire. From Indian to seafood, good street food, British cuisine, french, tasty duck sandwiches, etc. etc. and of course, you won't stay hungry. If you fancy some sparkly/fizzy drink, you want to warm yourself up with a cup of coffee, or tea, you'll find it all there. Get out at Tower Bridge metro stop and you'll find it easily. P.S: Options to pay by card, or in cash - great, great, great!||January 21, 2017
Stephen A||50||Surrounded by history, the most wonderful old market still working today. Go, buy the produce and artisan products - and - grab lunch! Lots of amazing eateries.Could do worse than Roast, Applebees (fish) or Elliots.||January 21, 2017

theofme||50||In this market you could find everyhting! It's a small food paradise. You could try to taste some cheese and wines.||January 20, 2017
wcwatkins7||50||Simply brilliant food market. However, you can easily pay a fortune if you're not careful. Fruit and veg, for example, are typically very over priced. The permanent food stalls tend to serve much better food than those that only appear some days||January 19, 2017
B370||40||enjoyed the wide options of food at this market.loved the scotch eggs and sangria!will definetely visit it again when in london.||January 19, 2017
Arthurascii||50||I worked around Borough Market for years*, it's a delightful place for lunch, browsing and people watching. It's also a paradise for thieving little toe rags who take advantage of all the distracted people who are being constantly jostled. It was a policeman who told me they call it Pickpocket Alley.Go, have a great time, have a lovely lunch. But do what the locals do and keep a firm hand on your wallet and phone.*not as a pickpocket||January 19, 2017
Gpwc||50||After a few beers in the wheatsheaf we walked around the market,Never know what to try next,love the cheese and the bread but always end up at the tapas bar at the far end for piella and chorizo ||January 19, 2017
Kate M||50||This market is amazing. It has many food stalls, shopping, eateries. Its a must see. From Italian to Indian to Middle Eastern. I highly recommend.||January 19, 2017
b d||50||Lots of different food choices but very heavily skewed towards meat. Some days are slower than others with fewer vendors open. All kinds of food stalls - cheese, pasta, seafood, coffee, dessert, juices, sausage, and more. Fun place to just roam around in. Was there when it was cold and not sure how these vendors made it through the day in the open air stalls - brrrrr. Watch for vehicle traffic though as there are delivery trucks and cars coming through here.||January 19, 2017
Dunks961||40||I came to Borough Market after hearing people rave about it, and boy was I surprised - the amount of artisan/fresh produce was amazing - admittedly I arrived just after it opened so it wasn't that busy, but the atmosphere was still brilliant!||January 19, 2017
trinigirl2015||50||if u r a foodie like me - this is paradisea bit crowded on saturday lots to see and taste had a blast looking at all the displays vegetables fruits food and drinkvery friendly place||January 18, 2017
Sweta S||50||I didn't realise how big the market was until I got out. It has so many varieties of food from non vegetarian to vegan. An absoulute paradise for people who want to try different type of food.||January 18, 2017
natthaphonc||40||The atmosphere was filled up with gastronomic soul. There were various kinds of shops- flower, seafood, cheese, etc. I followed the tasty smell to food zone. The scallops were really fresh and delicious. It was a tourist spot too. If you were a street photographer, you would get many interesting pictures here.||January 17, 2017
Linda B||50||I love this market. Lots of delicious ethnic and unusual foods. Street food as well as food to take home. It was very busy on Saturday morning.||January 17, 2017
Diane J||40||Stumbled across this market on our way to visit the Shard and decided to stay a while, it was busy and the atmosphere was great , lots to see, taste and experience, we tried cheeses, and bought some great street food that was delicious. Well worth a visit and we will come here again when next in London.||January 17, 2017
LordOfKendal||30||It was a bit too touristy for me. It was no longer the traditional and historic market. The building may be historic but it was not the place locals go to. I tried the cod and chips and it was soggy. You could find a wide spectrum of food from all over the world and a few traditional English delicatessens. ||January 17, 2017
cprettyman||50||What a place, make sure you go hungry or you'll only be disappointed in yourself. It would take all day to list the amazing foods on offer but over the course of a couple of hours I had an olive and cheese warm bread stick, a salt beef sandwich, A spicy pulled lamb creation, a high class scotch egg an immense doughnut. Brilliant food brilliant atmosphere all round great morning||January 17, 2017
Zoe H||50||I love good markets and the Borough Market doesn't disappoint. In the centre of London it still feels like it has space. There are too many good lunch options to choose from which is always difficult so we tend to share a couple of things. There are also great shops for cheese, olives, spices, salami etc.||January 17, 2017
jjinimm||50||It's quite a nice experience to come here. It's just beside of Southwark Cathedral and a walk away from Winchester Palace.. It's hard to miss as it's a lively place with lots of things to buy and see..||January 16, 2017
kidsdo2013||30||Unless you absolutely love being herded like cattle, don't go on a weekend. I'm sure the weekdays are brilliant for market fare, but we couldn't get anything accomplished and were just overwhelmed on a Saturday. But I would love to live around the corner to pop over every day to sample something new.||January 16, 2017
_mdecoe||40||The food in London is very expensive. This was a nice place to taste some different types of food for a little less money. I loved the chocolates, but they were not English. Most English food, I found to be unpleasant.||January 15, 2017
elly j||50||Omg it was so busy..... and it's only January but what fun.., vibrant loud and trendy. You could buy any food you wanted so much on offer for any pallet. Buzzing and happening part of London, a must do if you are visiting ||January 15, 2017
tonx75||50||We stopped by on a rainy Saturday and weren't disappointed. So many good things to try. We were there for a couple of hours and loved it. Definitely make it a point to check it out and come hungry! Oysters, goat kabobs, scotch eggs, etc. So much fun.||January 15, 2017
audrinae||50||Amazing place, great demand of food options, good mood in general, great prices, the greatest fact is a local people place and choice ||January 15, 2017
RebeccaG929||40||We visited as a large group and sampled the lovely food and wine! Great atmosphere and lots of variety of fresh food.||January 15, 2017
Mike H||50||I have been here several times before and was not disappointed this time. There is such a vast array of different food to eat and also loads of food to take away and cook or eat at home.||January 15, 2017
Happyman20188||50||Very nice food / crowded but many stalls with international and local cuisine . Love to go there again and again . V cool place if you are in London please must go and try different food and also can get fresh juice as well . Indian food counter is available as well vegetarian food . ||January 14, 2017
sowpow||50||So many food choices - it's hard to pick! They are all really good and there are choices from food stalls to sit down restaurants. Definitely check out Bread Ahead for their donuts and La Tua Pasta (amazing pasta)||January 14, 2017
CR7_Whit||50||A trip to London would not be complete without a morning browse around the best food market I have ever been to.The smell of this place it out of this world as there are several street food places cooking away early on as well as more diverse country's represented in the market.Whatever you want to eat you can probably buy it here and this is so much much more than just a market as there are equally as good independent shops (Monmouth being the standout- for coffee & pastrys)around the perimeter as well to take in as well as Hawksmoor being close.I've bought from a few of the sweet stalls which include cheesecakes & macaroons but have also sampled a bacon butty at Roast to go & a toasted cheese sandwich from Kappacassein which was not what I expected as it had traces of potatoe & leek in there (extremely hot so watch you pallet) but really nice for a change.Overall I'd recommend going here to sample the smell as much to eat any foodie should visit here 100%||January 14, 2017
Rachel O||50||Stumbled completely by accident into the Borough Market. It is a foodie paradise! Awesome scotch eggs, coffee, mulled wine and 'the world's best toasted cheese sandwich'!||January 13, 2017
peachamaamaa||50||So this was a big hit with my foodie family, during a stay in Southwark. From the fresh fruit and veg, to the stonebake pizzas, venison burgers, boar hot dogs, thai curries and fresh coffee everything was so full of flavour and quality. The Market was full of atmosphere at all times of the day, and such a pretty place making the most of this industrial space. We will be back!||January 13, 2017
smracr||50||It was a cold, drizzly, dreary day, but the market was just the place to be! The hot food stalls were all enticing; we wanted to try everything. Then there were the desserts and baked goods all calling out, "buy me, buy me!" And then the fresh produce, and fish, and meats, and cheeses...need I go on?!||January 12, 2017
SamB973||50||This is my favourite place in London. Cannot stop visiting and eating. Put on about a stone. Nightmare!||January 12, 2017
Nicholas H||50||Despite many challenges over the years, Borough Market is now thriving with the most amazing range of food stalls to browse and savour. Great atmosphere and even better 'street food' and all manner of merchandise to taste and buy, all of it interesting and good quality. Shop if you like or see it as a leisure destination, either way you'll have a great time. The cider stall usually leads me astray, but so might many others on any given day. There also many restaurants in and around the market, so you can whet your appetite with some window shopping, then eat more formally indoors.||January 12, 2017
ktjoso||50||We were on a walking tour that went through the space (part of Harry Potter was filmed there!), and we made a point to return to the market. I is chock full of vendors selling all sorts of edibles. I bought spices, cured meats, an ice cream cone, an Italian sandwich, oysters, donuts, green smoothie, and a roast duck sandwich. (Most eaten there and some eaten at home... we were gluttons!) Vendors were slammed, but friendly. Definitely something for everyone there. Lots of samples to be had. Oh, there was also corn on the cob with chili and lime! Come hungry.||January 11, 2017
ElenaNW87RL||50||Well known, most visited and the busiest, arguably the oldest food market in London, few steps from the London Bridge and the Tate Modern. Must go for real foodie to browse an overwhelming display of regional specialities, from rare-breed meats, cheeses, fish, game, fruit and veg, to loaves of bread, cakes and pies, and all kinds of preserves, chutneys and teas. Go there before lunch, you won't need one.||January 11, 2017
3Melissa52||50||This is the place to come if you are hungry and adventurous and want a bite of everything. We tried a number of places including a restaurant (Proper Fish & Chips) and several stalls. Everything was delicious including the Mac & Cheese, meat pies, and sandwiches.Very crowded at noon as you would expect. We wandered around after most of the market was closed and felt safe. See if you can recognize Bridget Jones' flat and some Harry Potter settings!||January 11, 2017
SHUK71||40||I used to work near by for several years. this was always the place for good lunch on Friday. This is food market with plenty of choices.At the end of the market near London bridge you will find a small trolley with excellent ++ coffee.||January 11, 2017
Michael S||50||Do you like sampling charcuterie? What about unpasteurized milk? What about paella? What about scotch eggs? What about delicious sweets? What about goat curry? What about hard cider?Yeah, it's a cool place to eat.||January 11, 2017
Ivana A||50||Great place to go and have homemade food. You can find international food too. Lovely bread stores and a small plaza to sit and have lunch while listening live music.||January 11, 2017
Kate S||50||Come down to the market early one Friday, hear the sounds of the traders set up and get the first freshest bites of the day before the crowds set in, then take cover in Brindisa to watch the same crowds from the safety of a table laden with Spanish delicacies and a carafe of Navarran red for s long lazy lunch....There's no foodie market like it. Take in Southwark Cathedral, the Golden Hind, Tate Modern, then wander back for more cake and hot coffee.Best days ever.||January 10, 2017
micos1993||40||Take a walk around here and have something to eat. Do go there is you are not hungry! You are going to eat some beautiful food. Its pretty packed so go early for a better look.||January 10, 2017
Eunmaj||40||If you like good food go here. I only wish I could have brought some of the wares home with me during our recent weekend break in London. ||January 10, 2017
LawranceTraveller||40||We don't live far away and Borough Market is one of our favourite places to take visitors. It manages to be both utterly English and London and also cosmopolitan and exotic. More hipster than Dickens, perhaps, but VERY much worth a visit.||January 10, 2017
GeoJono||50||Was heading to HMS Belfast from Tower Bridge tube station, spotted a market up a alley that looked interesting. Turned out to be this huge culinary smorgasbord hidden away beneath beautiful Victoria tail arches. The market was cast and served everything from venison burgers, to oysters, tea and scotch eggs. If you like food hit up this place, pretty much right beneath the Shard.||January 8, 2017
Eklovestotravel||50||Not an off the beaten path sort of place but an experience not to be missed. Tons of awesome food options and great people watching. Visit with an open mind and let your nose be your guide. The crowds can be overwhelming so allow plenty of time or come knowing you will miss a lot. I wish we planned our visit before an evening at our flat so we could have taken full advantage of all the prepared items for a casual dinner that night. Keeping that in mind will keep this on the must come back list. ||January 8, 2017
Zoey O||50||I've lived in London all my life and Borough market is one of my favourite places to visit. I'm a big foodie so it's probably why!There are so many amazing little stalls with different types of food! Do try a salt beef sandwich and do try a doughnut from Bread Ahead - AMAZING! Also pop by Monmouth Coffee for some incredible coffee of course!||January 8, 2017
Annie_in_the_burg||50||We stumbled into Borough Market looking for a snack before the Tour for Muggles. AMAZING array of vendors with fresh produce, flowers, and freshly prepared food. Found wonderful Lebanese shawarma wraps made to order. Been to London four times and had no idea this place existed.||January 7, 2017
spitt2un||50||Borough market is a hidden gem, not really a secret but a market hidden under a train bridge if you like.This is my 3rd visit and it never disappoints.You'll be spoiled for choice if you are looking for fresh produce, artisanal cheese, freshly baked breads, seafood, meats, cured meats, places to eat and drink... tea, coffee, beers, ales, wines... and much much more.There is a wonderful cafe called Monmouth there that serves drip coffee and whatever else coffee related... the roasts are fantastic, almost caramely!La Tua, a pasta shop that sells fresh pasta and cooked pasta is my one fav spot! Stalls selling Paella, freshly shucked oysters, kebabs, pulled venison Sandwiches, wild vor burgers, fish and chips and many more are all around. Your best bet is to get there by the underground and the closest station is London Bridge. Trust me, you don't wanna miss this one. A place for locals and visitors.||January 7, 2017
theharrogatelady||50||We love a wander around Borough Market and it's always interesting to see the new wave of foodie stall holders. At 11.30 most stalls had queues of folk waiting hungrily for lunch. The smells from around the world make your mouth water. I noticed for the first time a seating area and toilets so you can rest a while and enjoy your food. Lots of food outlets but not as many fresh food selling stalls. Definitely one to wander around.||January 6, 2017
Steve T||50||A great place for foodies - stalls selling obscure spices, oysters, vegetables, artisan bread, etc. You can even pick up some jellied eels.||January 6, 2017
Jamjar1234||50||1 of my favourite spots in London and a real must visit for foodies and well....everyone! Lot's of choice in regards to international cuisine (try the Venison burger), as well as desserts afterwards the food, vibe and people watching available makes this place ideal for a well earned bite to eat after a busy day sightseeing. In addition you can walk along nearby south bank towards the London eye which is lovely. Make sure you go! ||January 6, 2017
rebecca g||50||We loved the market. There are so many things to see and eat - the food and people watching are terrific. We especially loved a couple of the indian food stations.||January 6, 2017
Sammy N||50||First time to BOROUGH MARKET after a dozen visits to the UK .. .. Most-amazing OUTDOOR MARKET I've ever been to .. .. AMAZING FOOD and a terrific way to start/end any trip .. .. Tons of food to take home, eat on the spot or to store for a special occasion .. ..Stopped at GUJARATI RASOI and had their fabulous THALI (veg bowl) w/ YOGURT SAUCE and it was splendid ~ Brilliant for a cold day with just enough spice to keep you warm .. .. BRILLIANT!!I though FARMER'S MARKET/THE GROVE (Los Angeles) was the best I've ever been to but BOROUGH MARKET is #1 .. ..||January 6, 2017
Graham F||50||Having descended from the Shard view, we had spare time on our hands and were well peckish! A short stroll from London Bridge Station gets you into Borough Market which is excellent if you are a foody. Pretty good value (unless you hit the Turkish stall where a baklava is likely to cost you a fiver!). The rest of the street food is so enticing and between us we tried 4 different dishes! All excellent!||January 6, 2017
Cornwallchloe||50||Loved this, we all had lunch here. Great walking round and choosing what you wanted. Amazing choice of food should be something to suit all tastes. Amazing cakes too plus great fish, vegetable, bread and fruit stalls. Well with a visit, we shall return!||January 5, 2017
Singzalott||40||We walked the riverwalk from the Eye to Borough Market. Fun to peruse and buy baked goods and sweets, but couldn't use the produce or meats because staying in a hotel. Kind of like shopping for gourmet food under the subway lines. Lots of places to eat standing up, but we went to a nearby pub to rest our weary bones and have some beer! Has a "real" feel about it!||January 5, 2017
Milky44||50||Everytime i am in London i make a point of visiting Borough Market. It offers a wide variety of food and drink from round the world. With many of the stands offering free samples.

I highly recommend a visit it one of the must see sights of London.||January 5, 2017

It is also market for local shoppers to get cheese, meat, vegetables, spices, etc. And the people watching is better than average. Tourists - don't miss this place.||January 4, 2017
marshalls12||50||Amazing places food products flowers and stalls food so fresh like being stuck back in time. A true taste of London. Oyster bar too. Visit globe tavern just outside if you loved Bridget jones that's the door to her flat in the films.||January 4, 2017

chickandbeast||50||Great food market with lots of sampling and hustle and bustle. I was just passing through London on a short trip, but it would be a great local place to shop if you resided there too.A little bit or a lot of everything right there. The aromas of the meats, cheeses, desserts and pastries make your mouth water. Don't go there hungry.||January 4, 2017
instructorjason||50||I had seen this market on a number of vlogs and it did not disappoint. This is one of the few places we visited twice during our stay in London. The atmosphere and quality of products is amazing. Our whole family enjoyed the experience. Our favorites were the duck confit sandwich, the burgers and the amazing cheeses and chorizos we bought.||January 4, 2017
anjanj||50||If you are a foodie, you must visit Borough Market! The different stalls have delicious baked goods, breads, meats, international cuisines, and I even was able to get a shot of what grass, after all the indulgences! So much fun and such great foods, I wish I could have brought it all home with me!||January 4, 2017

YiannaDem||50||Borough market is a lovely place. The food options are great, from oysters and cheese to fruit and spices and freshly baked bread. At the same time there are street food stalls with desserts and meals (pies, thai). Location is easy as its next to London Bridge. The market is covered so rainy days wont be a big problem. It is also surrounded by pubs, wine bars and restaurants so can always relax with a bottle of wine after walking through the market.||January 3, 2017
susan125c||50||Despite how small this market is, the choice of food stalls is really impressive as is the quality of what is offered. You can find some really nice take aways out there. All very tasty and inexpensive. Great London spot with a good and relaxed atmosphere!||January 3, 2017
K3rl5656||50||This is a very nice place to take the family. The food is very good and there is lots for everyone to try and sample. The kids were a bit tired of walking by then.||January 3, 2017
John H||50||If you are looking for a mixture of fantastic food shops and stalls selling a huge variety of ethnic street food close to a central London mainline station, look no further.||January 2, 2017
GodfreyG233||50||Not to be missed. A culinary melting pot. Delicious food. Interesting dishes. The only downside is that no stomach can handle all the heavenly food!||January 2, 2017
BEIreland||50||It's been there a long time but I suspect th gluten free salami sign is new. Great food. Unique and different. Best food of my trip. ||January 2, 2017

leesvillelake||50||Went on Saturday around noon and near Christmas. Very busy but navigable. Step out of the London Bridge Tube and you are there. We bought fresh bread from a French bakery and juicy strawberries from Spain to take back to our apartment. Then we had a superb lunch of fish that was caught the previous night. Look for a daily special, as that will be the freshest and best value. I topped it off with a fresh fruit smoothie. Most of it is under roof, so a bit of rain won't matter. Prices are reasonable, and the ambiance is superb. Be prepared to walk and stand for a good while, as tables are hard to come by. We did find a table for our lunch, as the turnover is fast and vigilance pays off. I loved this market, and I will be sure to go there on every visit to London.||January 1, 2017
mmorrisroe||50||An excellent place. Superbly laid out if not a little busy on occasion. Another market to eat your way round. Food here is as diverse as anywhere in London. An attraction in itself||January 1, 2017
Gorden L||40||Cannot miss this if you like street food. Plenty of variety from English Fish and Chips to Oysters, from Chinese and African to Indian and German sausages. We tried the Oysters, fresh and sweet. Fried rice with seafood and chicken is great for cold weather. The chicken is really juicy. The doughnut is good, the roasted pork bun is good, the mull wine is nice. But be aware that although it seems not very much on each item, but if you eat a lot still quite costly... we spend 35 pounds just for food. The same amount could give you a decent lunch in London!||December 31, 2016
115marieangec||50||After reading on tripadvisor we decided to have a look and have lunch. Nice atmosphere. Food from around the world. Cheap and great quality. ||December 31, 2016

joyfulm2015||50||Over a 4-day trip to London, I first came to Borough Market with a Food Tour and had so enjoyed some of the great noshing that I made a mad dash back on my own before departure. It's exactly the foodie experience I look for when I travel. I had some really great samplings, include awesome Comte and Brie cheese. I also enjoyed the Scotchegg from Scotchtail and had what I think is the best doughnut (ever!) that was filled with a vanilla custard from Bread Ahead. Just typing up this review is making me pine for a return trip!!||December 29, 2016
SFree73||50||A foodies paradise! Try Monmouth Coffee, Bread Ahead (donuts & olive cheese bread sticks) and any variety of other foods you could imagine- Ethiopian, Thai, Turkish cuisine & more. Loved our visit!!!||December 29, 2016
MrsTillymint||50||Have been many times now to Borough Market and it never disappoints. Always go to Mons for their wonderful fondue to make at home. All the stalls are so enticing with beautiful displays and so much to choose from. Bought some Christmas gifts when I last visited for family foodies.||December 29, 2016
114maram||50||Only in a cosmopolitan city like London you can find a food market offering such huge variety: special cheeses from uk, France or Italy; truffles from Croatia; olives, olive oil and honey from Greece.. There are stalls specialising in spices or teas or honey or cakes. It's a great place to come to for lunch. You're truly spoilt for choice here. No matter what your taste is, you'll find something you love. My mother adores Borough Market and asks to come here whenever she is in London. If you enjoy international food, this is The place to come to.||December 29, 2016

802064512||50||We went to the Market the Thursday before Christmas. Thursdays are a quiet day we were told; not so this one!! Without reservations we could not obtain a seat in the restaurants, so we opted for street food: fish and chips and vegetarian Indian.All excellent. You can buy most any great food here. I am GF and bought a non-oat granola at Mini Magoo's. A fun place to visit!||December 27, 2016

There are also fantastic made to order food and drink stalls perfect for lunch. I went to do some Christmas shopping and wasn't disappointed, but I'll definitely be back just to browse and try other delicious looking options!||December 27, 2016
890RichardF||50||We 'stumbled' upon Borough Market as we had booked a meal in a nearby restaurant. In a way we wished we hadn't as it meant we didn't want to buy anything to eat here. There's loads of options and it's certainly worth just visiting here to have lunch whenever you're in London - that's our plan next time anyway!||December 26, 2016
Anna B||50||Really enjoyed this one while visiting London for a weekend. Various tasty products, fresh delicious food from all around the world. Cosy atmosphere. Nice to take away something and eat close to Thames.||December 26, 2016
BleedingAussie||40||Whilst a bit of a tourist trap it had a diverse range of food to buy and sample. A great place to have lunch, although no seating so keep this in mind if have young children. Must be crowded in summer- however everything is. Close to the tube. Recommended||December 26, 2016
eudoxiob||50||In this market you can find foods from different countries. You can walk between food and beverage stands, and taste many different flavours. The price is not too expensive, and there are many options for dessert too, like many types of candies. There is a restroom inside the market. The negative point is that there are no chairs to sit; you have to eat standing up. This market is near to the London Bridge. I recommend that you have lunch there, at least one day.||December 26, 2016

brunakelly||50||This has been by far the best food I've ever been to. There are so many amazing food choices and each item you get is more delicious than the last. In fact, this is where I got to eat the best donuts I've ever had and the best fish and chips. The market is huge and the more you get lost the more money you spend. I've been to others in other countries but this one has been my absolute favorite. London sure knows how to make food and even now that's all I think about. ||December 25, 2016
ScottsdaleReviewer||50||If you want a real fun food experience make time to grab food at the Borough Market. They have so many food and dessert option and the place is packed. It's rare to find a seat, so it's full of people taking food to go or sitting and eating on a curb.Our favorite foods include the cheeses, salted beef sandwich and the vanilla filled donuts!||December 25, 2016
lumuty||40||interesting place to visit. for trying the choclates, cheese, drinks. old but looks classic. while beeing a tourist,nice stop for having a tasty burger during the london tour.||December 25, 2016

ArdaghMark||50||From small suppliers through established specialist suppliers to food stalls, Borough Market has it all.Surrounded by some lovely pubs and restaurants, if you love food, this is a must.If you want a market with cheap knock off clothes and trainers, try elsewhere. ||December 24, 2016

782dj||50||Not been..? You gotta go..Go early...lunchtime is packed..There is a stall that does doughnuts..huge ones...about the size of cricket balls...They are hollowed out and injected with fillings...not a spoonful of jam. But a huge go band a half full of cream. I bought eight...I won't apologise for my gluttony. .They are superb. .had them today as well.Only thing...try and get a simple mug of tea...like a p.g or similar ..Not a chance..shamefully..Great experience..it won't disappoint.||December 23, 2016
KLE2013||50||The London Bridge Tube stop off the Jubilee or Northern Lines is the closest stop to Borough Market, the oldest food market in London founded in 1756. Open Thursday, Friday and Saturday and located under the railway tracks adjacent to Southwark Cathedral, this market is a vibrant, fragrant must experience for the foodie. Small stalls and stores sell organic fruits, veggies, cheeses and condiments while numerous stands sell baked goods, international foods, sandwiches and entrees. Come hungry and delight in the tasting and drinking opportunities. Be prepared for crowds and long lines for the most popular food stalls. German sausages were delicious, the gluten free cakes a joy!||December 23, 2016
kimrux||50||I love this place, I would go every day if I worked near by. Every time I go I manage to sample something else delicious. On my most recent excursion I had the most delicious mince pies. Perfect Christmas treat, the vibe in the market is so wonderful at Christmas as well.||December 23, 2016

yashdem||50||Borough Market is the one of the best food market in London. You can find different types of food from all over the world such as Ethiopian, Turkish, Greek, German, Spanish...etc You can find over there is the best Salted Beef Sandwich in whole London. ||December 22, 2016
Peteski2016||50||This is a very popular market as it has something for everyone. Fresh food. Cooked food. Wine cheese meat sweets - everything. Had a Duck confit sandwich and an Argentinan empanada and both were over the moon. Food for everyone even vegans......great place. ||December 22, 2016
BroLucius||50||It was a grey day as we visited this market by the side of the Thames. We soon forgot the weather in the whirl of colour as you move from stall to stall. The foods offered, both for sale and for immediate consumption, come from around the world. The smells are enticing on their own. One is tempted to feel jealous of those who work nearby and can pop down here for a very tasty lunch at a modest price.||December 22, 2016
Samantha T||50||Wonderful atmosphere - a definite 'London' feeling. Selling all kinds of food. Definitely worth a visit.||December 22, 2016
Bigboy1959||50||Had not visited here in years and totally forgot what a great location this is for buying, eating and discovering food/wine and ingredients. Including a stop at a fabulous wine bar we were here for over 3 hours and it was worth every minute, if we had not had a restaurant reservation nearby we would have stayed much longer.Make sure you cover all areas and ensure you are hungry before arrival.||December 22, 2016
Hazel L||40||Wonderful market - the earlier you can get there the better as it gets extremely busy & you can't get to see the produce properly. Great choices for eat-on/the/spot food. Afterwards pop into the lovely adjacent Southwark Cathedral to rest your weary legs, if you are lucky, listen to the organist practicing & see if you can spot Doorkins the Magnificat !||December 21, 2016
Alwaystravelling042||40||Great find in centralLondon a good range of stalls food stations and artisan products really lovely atmosphere too||December 21, 2016
PeggyH496||50||We went to the Borough Market on our last day in London. We loved it! The fruits and vegetables were displayed so beautifully I had to take pictures of them all! The cheese shops were all amazing and the grilled cheese sandwich was awesome!||December 21, 2016

mariadM4350ZZ||40||Little market, with great food, very clean an friendly people. You can eat a different foods, but all of them very well presented||December 21, 2016
EastYorksCpl||30||Visited on an early Saturday morning and it was already busy , not good in a wheelchair , overwhelmingly full of foodstuffs which is ok but not what you would really call a market ! More a place for Foodies to restock and replenish the larder !||December 20, 2016
Zeevs17||30||Food market, eat eat eat. Many cheese to buy. Different food styles near London bridge station. Can come and find something interesting food.||December 20, 2016
frasedbv||40||an incredible market, situated in a historic area of London. The variety of goods is incredible but the crowds are dense. Go early to avoid the congestion if you are inclined, like me to panic attacks||December 19, 2016
867ally||40||I love visiting this market for actually variety of cooked, ready meals which I can eat hot and fresh right from the stove. These are often based on authentic recipes and ingredients, so turn out as quite unique treats||December 19, 2016
mark w||40||We made a family visit on a Saturday morning in early November, as part of a weekend break. The market is 5mins walk from London Bridge Station.The place has a real buzz and was very busy. Most of the stalls we looked at were indoors. The food and drink selection is amazing and the stall holders are very knowledgeable about their products and willing to have a good chat. A lot of them also have an internet delivery service. This is a must visit attraction but it is also a proper food market with quality but unique products. Small distillery gin was a big favourite of mine! Very warming on a wet, cold afternoon.We will definitely be going back.||December 19, 2016
Amber B||50||Wow loved it so many food and drink stalls with tasters. Everything a foodie could want and more .It's close to Christmas the crowd were a bit much for me but we will be visiting in the new year we purchase some truffle honey after a free sample and chocolate wine. You really could spend all day here but don't go to hungry you'll be spoiled for choice ||December 18, 2016
Sarah R||50||This is a great market for a really interesting experience. Although it is outdoors, most of it is sheltered and the smells, sights and tastes on offer are incredible. We bought a few bits from some of the stalls, which are very interesting and international. You can find some really different bits and pieces, such as fig bonbons from the Croatian place, huge dishes of authentic paella and no end of meats, fish and veg to sample and buy.We have been a couple of times, we went in December this year and bought a bottle of Prosseco for £10 with 2 disposable glasses, which we were able to carry around with us to really enjoy the experience.It is very busy, so be prepared to walk slowly and it isn't really advisable to take a buggy or small children who may get lost!||December 18, 2016
cemre85||40||One of the fav places in london. Kind of central, many quality food alternatives, nice pubs and bars..free wifi free seating..good sipirit especially in xmas time||December 17, 2016
FeedMe79||50||My other half and I decided to go on an empty stomach around lunch time to Borough Market. Situated just across the road from London Bridge station it is definitely easy to access. Although it was a Thursday afternoon it was packed. Lots of locals and tourists alike. I was like a child in a (very big) sweet shop; wanted to try everything and filled up too soon! I was pleased with the food I ate but yet there was still so more I wanted to try so we have made a pact to come back again in the new year. Not only are we talking about the food stalls but there are many stalls that sell fresh produce and handmade toiletries that you can buy home. Love the atmosphere of this market and think this is definitely worth a trip.||December 17, 2016
georgetig||10||It pains me to negatively review Borough Market as it is one of my favorite places in London, genuinely atmospheric and fun. However an evening of cheese and wine on Wednesday 14/12/16 was woeful in it's organisation. It was supposed to run from 6pm until 9pm, but as soon as it was opened it was immediately overwhelmed by vistors. All stalls present were 6-10 deep and the only hint of cheese present was the heady aroma in the air as it could not even be seen from the thong! Hoping that the initial rush would have dissipated I returned about 8.20pm, but it was still the same. To make matters worse all of the great regular cheese stores in the market closed as the 'evening of cheese and wine' stalls opened. A real wasted opportunity.||December 17, 2016
ShesAGoat||40||We went on a weekday when not all the stalls were open and it wasn't too busy but it was still a perfect thing to do and we had a fantastic time and ate so much. Really want to go on a weekend to see everything.They do need a map or something as we found ourselves walking around the same places a lot and not sure where things we'd be interested in would be. ||December 17, 2016
AnneChester||50||We visited on a Saturday afternoon on a recent weekend break to London. I believe that the market is different on a Saturday to the rest of the week and we loved it. It was very busy but the atmosphere was great and we really enjoyed the experience. The range of food and drink on offer was fantastic and we wish that we had gone at lunchtime to take advantage of it! There were also several craft stalls which were interesting. The meat, fish, cheese and vegetable stalls were beautifully presented and it is still a 'real' market. In my opinion it is the best market to visit if you only have time to visit one. It has something for everyone.||December 17, 2016
SunnyGirlie||50||The market place in Southwark, near London bridge, is mentioned as early as in 2014, so Borough Market has actually passed its millennium anniversary. Vital as ever it's a really exciting place, filled with bakeries, fishmongers, butchers, florists - you name it! Of course there are lots of restaurants and cafes as well, and you can enjoy anything from a classic British meat pie to French delicatessen. I highly recommend Borough Market in Christmas time - it's packed with people of course but the Christmas spirit is really high!||December 17, 2016
Msfilipe||30||Its okay, I think it was a little dirty and the food was too spicy or too fat... but there are very desserts and sweets that are great ||December 15, 2016
BarryW1970||40||Loads of stalls selling loads of different food types for eating now or taking away. We tried the Boston breakfast buns (yumm) and the pies and cakes as well as some good drinks. I think that this would be great of an evening with a number of different cuisines to try plus a variety of places to drink. It's a bit touristy (coach loads of foreign kids running around) and the hipster beard count was very high. Great shout for cheap eating and good times.||December 14, 2016
beas006||50||When you have this on your doorstep (you lucky Londoners) then there is no need to go anywhere else. Sublime fish, meat, fruits, juices - the list is endless. Top quality throughout and a joy to have in England. Use London Bridge for the closest tube.||December 14, 2016
JasonJoseph85||50||Borough market is a great place as a tourist or native LondonerStroll around having coffee, or alcoholic drinks, pick at little bits of food its great.I'd recommend going on an empty stomach and not planning o eat after.Also take someone if you want to plan things, can get expensive!||December 14, 2016
Cassie T||50||When my friend and I arrived at Borough Market, we both said that we weren't too hungry, yet EVERYTHING looked so incredible we still ate our fair share! This is an incredible place with places to buy fresh, as well as many food stands. Great place to get tastes of British, and international cuisine!||December 14, 2016
Velvetteddy||50||I LOVE this market! Everytime I go I find something new and exciting, sample things from different cultures and home made produce which is beyond anything you can pick up in a supermarket. Bread Head is a must visit stall as is the mushroom pate! ||December 13, 2016
victorian5||50||This is a great place to browse the stores and eat inexpensively but well. I have eaten samosas in lots of different places but these were definitely the best. There were so many different food choices and most were inexpensive, terrific lunch.||December 12, 2016
-Miss-Williams-123||50||Lovely little food market to wander around, lovely building, fresh and varied produce, and I had a delicious huge hog roast for£6, winner!||December 12, 2016
Nana K||50||I am in London for a semester as part of a study abroad program, and this is one of my favorite places in this city. The food is delicious, and the atmosphere is very lively, even when the weather is cold. The people at each stall are also usually very friendly. However, it is very crowded on a Saturday, so it would be better to go on other days. I would recommend the stall that sells Turkish delight and baklava - there are also samples!||December 12, 2016
Metropolitan_Man||50||Excellent atmoshpere and food selections. A must even if only for 1 hour! The other ratings prove why this is so highly rated!||December 12, 2016
Josephine F||50||We'd heard of Borough Market, but never had the opportunity to visit. It was well worth the long wait. Amazing food stalls selling fresh produce and great cooked street food. Lovely genuine people. We enjoyed it so much on Saturday, that we found ourselves back there on Sunday, when we had a wonderful Sunday lunch at The Globe..bravo!||December 12, 2016
Banjo191||50||After musing over a visit to this venue for ages, I finally got the chance as part of a Theatre Break weekend.WOW!For anyone even slightly interested in Artisan Food and great quality fresh products, this is the place to go. You could easily spend several hours here looking at and tasting your way around a massive range of flavours and smells.For me, it was all about the Bread; with Bread Ahead, Artisan Foods and Karaway Bakery my targets stalls. Flat Cap Coffee do a great Flat White and for something different get a coffee at the Turkish Deli.Also had a lovely Spinach and Feta Bourekas from Balkan Bites as a snack.||December 11, 2016
Ron T||50||Visited a few times in the past & never tire of it. A foodies absolute heaven. A very busy place with lots of atmosphere. I take the view of this gourmet market that if your a foodie & Borough Market doesn't have, it's not worth having.||December 11, 2016
Robert M||50||Borough Market is an open air fair located In the London Bridge section of London. If you want to get an opportunity to sample a variety of local cuisine and other wares and interact with local folks this is a great opportunity to do so.||December 11, 2016
orcho||40||the market is not so big but has a variety of food and merchandise from all over the world. a pleasant market to go around and have good food at the market itself, you can also buy ingredients to prepare your own meal at home. prices are fare. there are many restaurants and bars around the market.||December 11, 2016
Anna P||40||We stopped by this market on the way from the London Bridge tube station to the Tate Modern. We bought some spices and admired the wares for sale at the other stalls. We wish we could have spent more time here. Despite it being about 3:30 PM on a weekday, it was packed with people. Plan your trip accordingly as even walking through this place without stopping to browse results in slow progress.||December 11, 2016
ranlamb||50||We absolutely loved this foodie heaven. So much variety and choice, the smells and tastes.....wow! We went on a Saturday morning and it was very busy but it added to the wonderdul atmosphere. If in London, a visit to Borough Market is a must||December 10, 2016
773naml||40||It is the holidays so I was expecting it to be crowded but wow it was jam packed. Explored the whole area to see what was available but it was so packed that it was not worth the headache of buying something to eat and then finding an area to properly enjoy it. Lovers of cured meats and cheeses this is the place to be. ||December 10, 2016

Highlights include the Boston Sausage take away, fantastic cheese stalls and the macaroons! Too many tempting treats. Warning: If you arrive not feeling hungry you soon will!||December 10, 2016

gropius19||50||Borough Market was one of my favorite places in London. Next to Southwark Cathedral and close the the Tower Bridge Tube stop, there has been a market at this location for 1,000 years. The market has sort of a funky vibe reminiscent of Seattle's Pike Place Market. It is a collection of food stalls and shops that closely mirrors cosmopolitan London. My favorite stops in the market: Kappacasein for their incredibly delicious toasted raclette sandwich (I stopped there twice), Monmouth for great "third-wave" coffee and people watching, and the Spanish food temple, Brindisa where we bought the most sublime Jamon Iberico I have ever tasted. Also try their grilled chorizo sandwich which they grill and sell out front. So simple, so delicious!||December 9, 2016
KSD093||40||Really great fun. Lot's of food to choose from. It seems expensive but the portion sizes are huge!Lot's of other food available to be able to take home like gourmet honey, sweets, cereals etc. Worth a visit for lunch if you are in the area!||December 8, 2016

Joel M||40||Lots of different food stalls in Borough Market, you can get all manner of fresh food and drink here. I imagine this would be great if you live locally.||December 8, 2016
Athanasia V||50||This is a place I had not expected to see in the heart of London. It really impressed me. You can find literally everything from everywhere! I guess it is evidence of the multi-culturalism of this city!||December 8, 2016
Joe S||50||As an American, few things in London can be characterized as cheap, so Borough Market wasn't all that surprising. Highlights definitely include Neal's Yard Dairy (equaled only by the exquisite Alain Hess Fromagerie in Beaune France), the Bread Ahead Bakery, and some of the lovely pastry stalls. Atmospheric, happy, abundant, just a wonderful place, and of course, surrounded by pubs. What's not to like?||December 7, 2016
BothofusHullUK||50||Walking through this market was amazing, I have never seen such a variety of food on offer before. Fresh seafood, paellas, fish soups, pie& mash, wild boar and venison dishes, burgers of a variety of meats, it went on and on, all of which could be tasted.Then of course you had the cheeses, olives,breads and of course fresh fruit and vegetables a lot of which I hadn't seen before. There is too much more to mention without sounding like a shopping list but I would recommend having a walk around and let your senses be overwhelmed by the smells and sounds of this lovely market.||December 7, 2016
QueenieWorcester||40||If you love your food then you have to visit here. Street food and stalls selling goods everywhere. Saturday afternoon is probably the worst time to go as it was mega busy but hey! We bought paella for lunch and it was delicious.||December 7, 2016

thyme04||50||A must visit for anyone who loves food, Borough Market has many vendors providing delicious things (go with an empty stomach). We started the day with the most delicious sausage wrapped in pastry at the Ginger Pig (it's enormous!) and then ate and drank here and there, as we explored the market. Monmouth coffee is excellent and a few doors down there is divine gelato. The market is located just south of the Thames so after we had our fill, we walked along the river and eventually across Millennium Bridge. A perfect way to spend the day. ||December 7, 2016
ATBrighton||30||If you love a takeaway this is your thing! A little repetitive especially cheese stalls! Such a shame the market has not thought of making better sales if there were more benches/seating for people who want a quick lunch.||December 6, 2016
Bluell92||20||It used to be really good ! Good quality food, at a good price. Now, it's a touristic overpriced place. DO NOT GO ON THE WEEK END ! VERY BUSY !But you will still at least find rare and unusual food. Wish it was less tourist and bigger. ||December 6, 2016
David C||40||We were in London for the day and decided to drop by the Market . Monday is quiet and many stalls are closed. Disappointing as there were still lots of people milling around.A great place normally for friends and family to eat on the hoof or in one of the many restaurants- a goody heaven but take some wet wipes !||December 5, 2016
youknowthescore||50||If you like food and spices and booze and cheese and well anything you can eat you will love this place, lots of free samples, amazing produce and a good range of street food. Go and visit you won't be disappointed. ||December 5, 2016
ariverrunsthroughit||40||I spend an hour or so here on the 3.12.16. I had previously been here on a Sunday (no market or limited). I should have been smart and checked the website which I did, this time around. It was a Saturday and I got there early; 8:15. The market was just starting. Stall holders were finalising their stalls for the day. There was lots of activity. I read a bit about the history of the market on the website which is worth a look before you plan on going.I would definitely recommend this if you were meeting a friend here to start your day off in London. I'm not an expert when it comes to the finer things in life but this seems like a great place if you're looking for the best international produce. The people running the stalls interested me. You can tell very quickly if the stall owner is passionate about his/her product (s) especially the speciality products. In a way they are all specialty products come to think of it. I'm sure you don't get a spot at the market without passing some sort of screening with the powers that be.After having a good look around I got a nice Columbian coffee with sugar cane, a bacon butty and pastries to take with me.Admission = £0 which is always a good starting point.||December 5, 2016
fabkeller||50||In the middle of London, Borough Market offers a huge variety of fresh products from local farmers, as well as for the highest cuisinist's demand. Fresh raw milk, all cheeses one can dream of, lots of little eatery places and even white and black truffle. It is quite an experience and you should not miss it.||December 5, 2016

There's something for everyone- even those of us with dietary needs. Situated on South Bank this is a perfect location to eat, drink and take in the sights.||December 4, 2016
Darene2014||50||Visited the market yesterday with someone who had never been before and who didn't even know it existed.Fantastic place, absolutely buzzing atmosphere. We wandered around the stalls sample tasting loads of foods from salsas to chocolate before finally settling for some lunch at a noodle bar called Wokit. Wasn't easy as there are so many good places to eat. Will do a separate review for this place, but it's well worth a visit, 5 star food for reasonable cost. The whole market is a haven for foodies but if coming on a Saturday be prepared to fight your way through the crowdsTo cap it all off we had an gorgeous warm Mulled Spicy Apple drink to wander around with as we finished our visit and headed out across London Bridge. Real treat on a sunny but cold day.Would highly recommend to all.||December 4, 2016

Stephen B||50||Do not go to this venue if you have already eaten. The choices of food is excellent and you could sample your way around this place and be content. you have to save room for the filled doughnuts, Cheese, Oysters the size of your hand, cakes and Burgers and sausages. A great day out. Thoroughly recommend||December 3, 2016
EddHowe||50||A must if you're from London or just visiting. Free tasters, great coffee, great food and great atmosphere. Highly recommended.||December 3, 2016
Erincita||40||We visited the Borough Market and loved getting to sample the different cheeses, teas and sweets. Everything you could want to eat is here - produce, meat, dairy, prepared cuisine. Our favorite was the meat pie and mash and we also got some fresh butter and cheese to go with a baguette. This is definitely a market to check out for gifts and for a simple meal. Our cheese and butter kept for days, so we would use it with either bread or croissant to make a simple breakfast.||December 2, 2016

Sjc997||50||I love Borough market, just the smell and the atmosphere sells it for me every time! Go on an empty stomach and have an epic time!||December 1, 2016
Nadia J||50||I wish I lived close to this market, it's an amazing place. If you want something as simple as mushrooms, there is a stall there with every kind of mushroom under the sun, equally so with the tomato stall, who knew there was so many different types of tomato.The street food is fantastic, such an array of food from all over the world, we ended up having home made pasta for brunch. We we there at approx 11am and there we people standing around eating food everywhere. There are plenty of samples to be had, we tried some mushroom pate, it was so nice we bought a tub of it.A must visit for anyone. We heard, but don't know if it's true or not, but it's only open to the public Thursday - Saturday.||December 1, 2016
Ajohnst4||50||Spent late morning wandering around the market. Foodies heaven with everything to buy from fish,meat,veg and much more.Many many places to eat, all different food types. We stopped many times to decide what to eat,you just have to for it ? Whatever you choose you won't be disappointed. ||December 1, 2016
357historian||40||Borough Market in London puts to rest the cliché that British food is bland and boring.Turkish coffee, Argentine steak, Italian salumi and good old British butties abound.While it can get crowded, the service is usually swift and the results well worth any wait.||November 29, 2016
marco c||50||It's definetely one of the best place to visit, eat and spend time in London. Worth to spend a few hours here in your life||November 29, 2016
Macfluff||50||Had a fantastic pulled pork wrap as well as toasted cheese sandwich here. They were so good, I went back two more times during this trip to have my fill before I headed home to sunny Spore. A definite must-go place for the good food! ||November 28, 2016
EmmaA2346||50||Great place to visit if you are hungry. Lots of good quality tasty food. Oysters, pasta, different regions, different flavours. Great place for healthy options too. Loved it, definitely would go back. ||November 28, 2016
traceyg749||20||We visited the market on Saturday and we were looking forward to the visit, I struggled with how busy it was, I was literally ping ponging off people, walking round people, being barged by people. The food queues were horrendous there was no way I was going to wait sooooo long for food||November 28, 2016
philip709||50||Went late November, loads of street food vendors, great food, something for all tastes and reasonably priced. Food from all over the world can be found here from specialist teas, and a fantastic spice shop to good old fish and cheese (not on the same plate though).  Beats going to a boring supermarket and has the added bonus of supporting some independent retailers - every little helps||November 28, 2016
HoneyBrown1976||50||Upon my second trip to Borough, I discovered new stalls with fabulous treats. One such spot offered a salt beef sandwich - well, a salad actually - with so much packed in, my brain couldn't fathom how I'd finish. My stomach convinced me otherwise, though. It is still best to visit during the week. While there's a crowd, it's not as humongous as the weekend. Come with an empty stomach. Doing so, helps you and the vendors.||November 28, 2016
590jonathanl||50||Wow!!! Years since I'd been here & I had forgotten how fabulous it is!! Oozing atmosphere & vibrancy with spectacular stalls of produce ranging from charcuterie,fish & green grocery!! Characters abound everywhere & we howled with laughter & a little impromptu cabaret to "Solsbury Hill" by a fishmonger & a young lady on the stall opposite!! Will definitely return when hungry next time as standing around swallowing oysters & champagne looked amazing!!! Great to see this Fabulous London treasure looking so healthy and alive!!! ||November 28, 2016
michaelcP5874LJ||40||Many vendors to look at choose from. Good food. Good place to people watch. Only problem is that it gets very crowded.||November 27, 2016
Muzzy1010||10||Listen up people ! If you are like your different food yeah perfect place there is loads of food from different countries any food and drink you can find it here ! BUT when you look for clean wise I'm not really sure all this stalls have 5 star food hygienic awards, however I don't like my food been on street showing off all day everyone poking it. It's not my thing so I find it some freshly cooked restaurants round here loads better ||November 27, 2016
Doolie77||40||Highly recommended for tourists and locals as this place is so busy and the atmosphere is great on Saturdays.Plenty of stalls selling all types of food,fruits,vegetables and lots of tastings available.Prices tends to be more expensive than your local market especially the exotic mushrooms. Mulled wines and hot spicy ciders at £3.50-£4.00 is great especially on a bitterly cold evening.Wonderful ambience and do visit especially during the festive period. ||November 27, 2016
Leo N||50||I've gone here twice. Both times were a delight. Food was so good. Reasonable prices too. My only regret was I didn't go more than twice ||November 27, 2016
kao202||50||A wonderful variety of food stalls, bread shops, drink vendors, oils and spices. Perfect to visit after walking across the London Bridge (not Tower Bridge). It is directly under London Bridge and worth a visit. We went in November and had some mulled wine and cider while walking around. ||November 27, 2016
Bev6968||50||Visiting here is like being in foodie heaven. All sorts of different artisan food stalls with things to try and buy. Look out for the scotch egg stalls and the cheese stall. An unbelievable choice of cheeses. There's also some indoor seating where you can go to sit down, Rumination on Mastication. Definitely worth another visit. Set in an old market area that's been renovated but not ruined, it's a visual treat on many levels. ||November 26, 2016
The_Loup_Garou||40||About three trips ago, we were in Borough Market, but primarily to have dinner at Roast.This trip, we were determined to spend more time, and to explore. That exploration was great.We discovered a wine shop, and a cheese shop, that we had missed before. Just those two discoveries were worth the visit.While crowded on a Tuesday, it was still easy to walk between the shops and stalls. I am not sure that I would say the same thing for a weekend, or a holiday.There is a great deal of diversity in the shops/stalls, and one needs to explore each, even if for a minute, or two.Very interesting, and intriguing, with some eclectic shops to explore.Even if one is not doing a sit-down meal, at say Roast, the food options abound.||November 26, 2016
KHJM||30||This market was very busy when attended on a Saturday- felt fairly festive with cold weather but nice hot foods including mulled wine on offer. ||November 26, 2016
bowlingboy1956||40||Went to borough market on friday first time we have been there, was well impressed great food stalls everywhere will return soon||November 26, 2016
jeni_hk||50||If you're a foodie, make sure Borough market is on your must-visit list for London! I kept putting off visiting because I wanted to have a good group of friends to visit Borough with (share food = eat more). In the end I went with my girl friend, who also happens to love food markets. We met on a Saturday morning (note - they are closed on Sunday), at 11am. Borough market is easily reachable by the tube. There are various entrance/exit gates though, so it can be a bit confusing to decide on a meeting point. An easy place to meet is at Padella (pasta restaurant) which is right next to one of the Borough market gates. Rule no. 1 to visiting Borough market is to be very very hungry. There are so many food stalls, and all the delicious aromas will make you want to try everything! My favorites are: Richard Haward's Oysters (try a range of the small and large oysters - personally I preferred the small ones, which were sweeter), Kappacasein Dairy for the raclette, Le Marche du Quartier for the duck confit sandwich, and of course the famous Monmouth coffee. I also bought some foods to bring back to HK - there's a great parma ham stall which offers tastings. The packaging is air tight so it's easy to travel with. There's also a stall that sells flapjacks made with flaxseeds. I bought some of the flaxseed powder, which can be mixed with your cereal, salads, soups etc. Health goals! I will definitely be back to Borough Market the next time I'm in London! There's just so much to offer here!||November 26, 2016
Bryce S||40||Borough market is worth a trip. If you are a food lover, it has staff after stall of vegetable sellers, a fishmonger and other stalls for raw materials including Neal's Yard Dairy nearby. The latter is incredibly good for cheeses.If you are hungry immediately lots of other stalls sell sausages, sandwiches and other street food, although this is definitely upscale. If you want more of a sit down indoors, find dining experience, the restaurant Roast overlooks the action. I recall there's a branch of the restaurant Fish too.It's a very high energy place. It's easy to reach, a short walk from the London Bridge underground station. There's other interesting stuff nearby. "The Golden Hind", probably a reproduction of Sir Francis Drake's ship is nearby.||November 26, 2016
brandonpX4243IO||50||THE FOOD I LOVE THE FOOD. So good so much to see lots of good food. Don't pass up those filled doughnuts I think I ate 3 ugh ||November 26, 2016
Sherie S||50||The Buzz, the atmosphere, the culture, the food were just the perfect blend. We caught the train in and walked to the market. We scoped out all the selections nibbling on a few tasters here and there. We then picked up some spicy cold meats, pesto, fresh breads n cheese and sat near the church embracing the fresh air. Totally worth a visit. ||November 25, 2016
gour_dim||50||This is one of my favourite places to kill time. I love going hear early in the morning before the stalls are even open. First places that open up are the fish mongers with their juicy fresh oysters. Make sure you go ther with empty stomach and try oysters, scotch egss, salt beef and many more. Its a lovely place especially if you love food.||November 25, 2016
Kay W||50||Came across Borough Market for the first time, but would definitely go back. Fabulous stalls packed with delicious foods from all parts of the world. lots of opportunities to snack or talk to traders. Great place for lunch , the only difficulty being choosing what to eat or drink. I could have spent hours there strolling around.||November 24, 2016
Stevie0121||50||Visited during a long weekend in London. I'm so glad I did, could have spent all day wandering the stalls and sampling the offerings from across the globe. The choice is overwhelming if you are looking to eat and you will be spoilt for choice. If you have a few hours on your hands, you could do far worse than spend a few hours here. All the stall holders were lovely, without being pushy, so if your not looking to buy and just sample a few things..that's ok to. The market does get very busy so choose your visiting time carefully if you want to avoid the lunchtime crowds.||November 23, 2016
Mitchell C||50||If you are a foodie, the Borough Market is well worth the trip. Everything from meat pies to coq au vin. Wine, cheese, sliced meats and all sorts of ethnic deliciousness. Beautiful setting as well.||November 22, 2016
shellsmedina||50||Stroll the stalls and bring your appetite. Organic fruits and veg, roasting pig on a spit, warm breads fresh from the oven, strange seafood, exotic dishes. It's all here for you to eat or take home. Free samples! ||November 22, 2016
trevorv349||50||There is great restaurant . Just on the outer side of Borough market .There is Fantastic food & drink . If you love fish , shell fish . The place is wright brother's . Try to book in plenty of time to get a table or a seat et the bar ||November 22, 2016
Aneea||50||Suffice it to say, we came back across town the very next day, just to have another burger at the Northfield Farm booth. I ordered the Lamb and my niece had the beef. I've been to 16 countries, and have eaten my fair share of delicious food around the globe, but this is in my top 5 places to eat. I would go back in a heartbeat! ||November 22, 2016
696ismaile||50||With so many relishes everywhere is so hard to decide what to take first, a lot of vegetables, huge range of meet, fish, sweets. Amazing!||November 22, 2016
Gehrig S||50||Borough market has changed from being a food market to a set of restaurant stalls. Years ago it was our destination to pick up high quality meat and produce. Now it is a place we go to graze, like a walking tapas bar. I highly recommend the Argentine empanada stand and Gourmet goat.||November 21, 2016
Peter C||50||My wife and I had a great couple of hours exploring all the food stalls in the London Borough Market. There is choice for every type of food palette, we loved the all the cheese options available and definitely recommend going to the Paella Stall!If you love lots of food options then this is the place to go. Food Heaven!||November 21, 2016
HelenJG786||50||Did a quick tour here with Matthew, our fabulous bike guide from Bike Tours of London. Borough Market is full of heavenly food stalls and you need to take your time. We had time for one shop only, the cheesemonger. If you're a foodie, you won't want to miss this.||November 21, 2016
Sharon Marie H||50||There is food from every corner of the world at this market, the different smells are enough to drive you mad and get your tummy rumbling. ||November 21, 2016
Edward A||50||Just so much food to choose from - maybe too much!Great spot to stop for lunchPlace was buzzingWas a bit expensive, but not more than you would expect eating out anywhere||November 21, 2016
The3kings2015||50||Never been before and it was amazing. So much food and stuff I've never seen before.I didn't know there was so many types of mushrooms!Wished we hadn't had breakfast as so many tempting foods to have tried. Fruit was excellent and well priced as well as samples to tempt you.Queues outside coffee shops and queues and the cheese stalls tells many a story so we will be back to explore more. ||November 21, 2016
Elizabeth C||50||What a fantastic market, although all foodstuffs, I've never seen anything like it! The array of fresh fruit, vegetables, fish, seafood etc., was mind-boggling. Only wish there was a market like it in Glasgow! There was a stall selling spices by the hundreds, some of which I'd never heard of or can't get at home in Glasgow, so made quite a few purchases. The stalls selling freshly cooked on-the-spot street food were awesome, and the aroma from all the various stalls was mouth-watering! Everyone was standing about eating, which adds to the atmosphere! They also do cookery demonstrations. Plenty of bars/restaurants round about too, but by the time you've tasted the "free titbits" who needs lunch? LOL! Tried a Thai stall and the food was delicious. I'll be back Borough Market!||November 21, 2016
ryan0789||40||My wife and I went on an "off" day so not the entire market was open. I personally enjoyed Covent Gardens more(a different type of market). But I give this market the benefit of the doubt considering we didn't go during the "full market" ||November 19, 2016
sudhirkjha||40||Borough market is a busy market in London where there are numerous eating places and small shops. Few branded outlet shops are also available. Ideal place to buy small trinkets and souvenirs for your friends. You could sit in the sun outdoors and enjoy the crowd while sipping your beer or coffee||November 19, 2016
MartynHC||50||Heard a lot about Borough Market and finally visited after living in London for a long time. Wow - an amazing variety of quality food, and a great mix of expensive and unusual items as well the everyday fruit veg cheeses and meats. Well worth a visit, although it's usually packed with visitors||November 19, 2016
talyakaya||50||There are all types of different cuisines. You can just walk around and have different tastes. You can eat paella, burger, Turkish delight etc. And it is a colorful place to take photographs. ||November 19, 2016
Jayne B||50||Haven't stopped eating yet wow! Everything you dream of eating in one placeHad a really lovely time , saw Bridget Jone's flatReally good atmosphere ||November 19, 2016

slovesshopping||50||This is our favourite go to place when visiting South Wark. Love the foodie stalls & fantastic selection of producers. Great for kids as well. Highly recommended. ||November 17, 2016
KoenR_11||40||Definitly need to go there when hungry! lots to taste; from different English cheeses over pies to Italian and Spanish delicious stuff. By all means do not limit yourself to the market as one of the nearby streets hosts a respectable cheese-shop (Sticheltons and stiltons!)All stalls should be open from Wednesday till Saturday, Mondays and Tuesdays some stalls are closed.The old-looking(no idea if authentic) information boards are nice details, but this is about food, food and more food||November 17, 2016
daveandtina2015||50||I expected to find fruit and veg stalls. Whilst there is a section with fruit and veg (including exotic / unusual fruits) I was pleasantly surprised by the vast number of stalls and booths selling 'street food' such as venison burgers, grilled cheese on sour dough, noodles and pizza to name just a few. There were also cheeses, hams, bread, oils, etc on sale from various countries with tasters on offer (yummy). We were there on a Friday morning, I would imagine that it would get extremely busy at lunch time but there is so much choice make sure you don't eat beforehand. Only drawback is the lack of seating.||November 17, 2016
Osnat A||50||fresh food and great food shops for all unique food lovers. dont miss Portena Shop with argentina's best empanadas and of course the Whirld shop of british gret fudge||November 17, 2016
KerryJohnEG||50||Many visits when up in London to Borough Market. You can literally snack your way around by tasting all the wonderful food on offer. Cheeses, honey, sweets, cakes, gorgeous and unusual greengrocery you name it!. Take a sturdy bag to carry your shopping home! Great if you want to make up a food hamper for a relative for christmas. Don't forget to visit the many pubs around for a rest from the hustle and bustle. A must is booking a table at "Roast" a restaurant in the middle of the market. Amazing food and service, but if you don't have time they have a place just outside to have a "Roast in a bun" which looks equally delicious.||November 17, 2016
TALCS73||50||I visit Borough market quite regularly because it has such a great variety of foods from all around the world, the main reason I go is a stall called Artisan foods which sells a variety of German cakes that are worth the journey alone! The market is steeped in history too, over a thousand years old! Very easy to get to, just a five minute walk from London Bridge railway station. ||November 17, 2016
C_Muls||50||Every time we go to London we always visit Borough Market. It is full of a huge range of different stalls to suit everyone! All laid out really well as well.Different sweet and savoury foods which are delicious! Would definitely recommend the free from bakery (dairy free cheesecake is amazing!) and the German stall where different sausages are available! ||November 16, 2016
EagleFlyer||50||Borough Market is a great place to spend part of a day, food shopping, eating and just being there. It is a bit of a maze and it is split in two by a road, so it does have much more than may appear at a first glance.There are a lot of different product sellers there, covering different cuisines, different types of foods, different products, etc. Spices, cheeses, meats, wine, beer, fish, vinegars, oils, cured items and so much more. As we were traveling lightly, we limited ourselves to some spices, foie gras and cured meats; items that we cannot generally find at home.There are also many places to get food to eat, both with food product sellers and in dedicated food stalls. Among the ones we tried is a French product place that offers duck confit sandwiches that were just fantastic.We got there early and the place was fairly quiet as it opened but quickly become more busy. There are tourists there but many people are locals shopping.Will definitely go there again when I next have part of a day free in London.||November 16, 2016
JY_Globetrotter||50||First, do check the opening hours and arrive on "full market days" as all the stalls and shops are open. Market is closed on Sundays. Secondly, don't come here after a meal or you will wistfully walk by to see and smell all the wonderful things you can't make room for (unless you are buying groceries to take home)We came here and hopped from stall to stall sharing Scotch eggs, meringues, fresh juice, oysters, wraps and coconut pancakes. Definitely recommend spending an hour or two here and sample a few vendors.||November 16, 2016
mandy4press||50||This was a cool market and they had a variety of food to choose from. Prices are pretty decent. It wasn't super packed and crowded which was nice. I would definitely recommend visiting during your stay to London||November 16, 2016
HatterWilko||50||Unfortunately we had just eaten, but the smells and sights if this market are incredible. I want to revisit with someone who isn't fussy about what they will eat||November 15, 2016
Kenneth H||50||Visited this market in the last weekend in October for the first time and my wife and I were completely flagergasted at the number and range of the products on sale. It was very much different, in a pleasant way, from what we had expected and we will certainly be going back. The only drawback was that being a weekend it was very crowded and difficult to move around easily, probably as a consequence of its increasing popularity.I suspect it might be a little less busy on week days.It would be hard to beat the atmosphere of this very appealing market.||November 15, 2016
IP1209||50||We visited Borough Market during our city trip and we were certainly not disappointed! If you love food, you will love this place. You can smell truffles, taste Italian food, Indian food, Thai food and everything you can imagine. You can try different kinds of honey and even enjoy a nice glass of wine. A food fest, go there!||November 15, 2016
850surajb||50||This is a very exciting market with different types of world street food. Ranging from Indian to Moroccan cuisine. You have also cheese makers shop here which have different kinds of cheese and which you can taste as well. They taste very delicious. Also there are fresh fruits and vegetables available. It's good fun to visit this market, you get to see a different culture of the posh London altogether. Make sure to visit before 5pm. The market close by then. Cheers||November 14, 2016
N6174KNpeterg||40||Very old market,but it has since been renovated,not quite the same atmosphere. It used to be more compact and and stall holders more eager to please you,it's still worth a visit,and we try to eat in Maria,s cafe, easy to find , great mugs of real tea plus the best egg and bacon rolls and superb bubble and squeak.Plenty of continental stalls selling food ,wines ,confections,beers ,fruit and veg,best of all no traffic and it's under cover.||November 14, 2016
samizuqu||30||I was very excited to come here, but ended up coming on a Monday, and there were just a few open shops. Tried the hog sandwich and the french merengue, it was good, but not out of this world. Wold try it again on another trip to come Wednesday through Sunday, but would not make it a priority.... Enjoyed more the Portobello market myself..||November 14, 2016
Lizzie0909||50||Visiting this market is a must when you are hungry. The sights and smells are amazing. It was Friday, mid morning, when we visited and we had already had breakfast. Lots of stalls cooking Paella, Curry, Sausages and lots more to tempt you with. Stalls with cheese, bread, olives, cakes and letting you sample them.A great place to plan to have lunch, but you will need to eat standing up as there is no seating area. Still a fantastic place if you enjoy your food. Very reasonable prices.||November 14, 2016
09beachbum||50||For any self respecting food enthusiast, this is a great way to spend a couple hours or meals in London. The market has all sorts of stalls & stores with sweets, bread charcuterie, spices, etc. You can also grab prepared foods for a takeaway meal. Awesome!||November 12, 2016
LayneO||40||There are also Turkish delicacies. Meats. Cheeses. And flowers. Stands offer street food like fish and chips. Well worth meandering through just to take photos. Easy to buy some nibbles for happy hour in your hotel room. ||November 11, 2016
Sheila O||50||The sheer range of products available to buy here is astounding, breads, cheeses, meats, spices, soaps, fish, mulled wines and cider, you could eat here very well for not much money, but that does not compromise on the quality on offer, just what to choose, will definitely return and spend more time there||November 11, 2016
opaogooner||50||I absolutely love this market . It has food for everyone and the variety is incredible. We ate some scallops , eels and oysters which were all fantastic. The cheese stalls are amazing as are the fruit and veg . I will be back in our next visit to London. ||November 11, 2016

TravelMunchkinFP||50||Absolute loved my first ever visit here - had crayfish tails, mulled pear and spiced guava drinks and pie 'n' mash......I expected this place to be really expensive, I was so wrong! Hubby's champers was £6, the food range is amazing and the people are lovely and friendly. We'll be back here next month||November 10, 2016
mr_rubenschmidt||50||One of my favourite spots in Central London!!! A perfect place to meet friends, have a drink and grab something to eat!!! Food stalls from all around the world and locally produced items!!! An explosion of smells for your senses!!! Top tip: weekdays are far less busy than weekends!!!||November 9, 2016
Traveller2920||50||Spend a full day walking around this lovely market, do food tastings, dessert tastings, people watching, taking fotos and. just have fun. Lots of places to lunch or dine or have a glass of wine. Seriously in Love with Borough Market! ||November 9, 2016
Richard H||40||We were here on a Wednesday lunchtime. The food is similar to what you find at Christmas/ European markets all over the country. A lunch is around a fiver. We stood to eat but later noticed that there were seats at the front of the market, at the London Bridge station side.||November 9, 2016
Denise W||50||Really good to visit on a Saturday, all kinds of displays, foods, drinks. The place gets very packed but certainly goes with a swing. PleSed to have paid a visit, one of the 'must do's' in The capital .||November 9, 2016
persvanbergstockholm||50||A fantastic place for food and drinks, the freshest supply of all you can imagine. Lovely, meat, vegetabled, fish, shellfish and much more.||November 9, 2016
Terry F||50||Don't take my word for it just go there and immerse yourself in the ambiance of the place. Purchase and taste the delights that you find there but more importantly just enjoy.||November 9, 2016
blue_travel67||50||This place has everything to offer. Could easily spend hours here. We went on a Saturday morning around 9am with no crowds. By the time we left, the place was so crowded. So happy to visit here during my trip.||November 8, 2016
darrenah||50||Visited borough market today and have to say what a great place to visit!Some cool stalls selling great food stuffs etc.In particular I had a had a venison burger from Furness fish and game, this was undoubtedly the best burger that I've ever eaten & I can highly recommend a trip there to sample such a great bit of grub!!!!!||November 8, 2016
Joanne C||50||My advice is to visit this market on Fridays, Sat or Sundays. I was there on Friday afternoon and the market was in full swing. Filled with varieties of fresh food and also loads of food stalls. Pastries sold there looked fresh and nice. Highly recommend this store that sells fresh oysters along the side of the market.I was also there again on a Tuesday and there weren't many stalls opened that day. So it is advisable to go over the weekends.||November 7, 2016
Pi P||50||I told my gf about this brilliant foodie market so we decided to visit it on Saturday which is one it's very busy days with lots of people bustling around but worth the effort In the market it has lots of cheese stalls with produce from many countries and you can sample some of the cheeses and again at stalls selling different cured meats again with samples Also there are meat .game .wine .spices fish .vegetable. oils .flowers .breads .cake stalls and also many food stalls and many more restaurants just outside in the streets around the market It's definitely worth a visit if you are a tourist or a local as you will a happy few hours trying the food and buying some brilliant produce .Definitely visit again the next time I am in London ||November 7, 2016
chloeg336||50||Being a Borough market virgin, I just didn't know what to expect. The market is amazing with food from all over the world. Most stalls have tasters for you to try and the sellers are very happy for you to test! They even have a prosecco stand which went down wonders with me and the girls. We chose to buy a range of foods: Caribbean and Syrian goat to name a few! Beautiful market. Probably wouldn't recommend for families with small children as it is very busy ||November 7, 2016
Inkisblue||40||Are the best days to visit, turn up early because from lunchtime on its just heaving, not a pleasant experience if you're a small kid. It's been given a makeover and as a result lost a little something. The best value is the greasy spoon cafe in the middle. There are lots of tasty variations in the fashion foods Nestor the cathedral a plot with taster plates on the stall the other side by the street coffee shops tends to be produce to be bagged up and taken home. Much of the items on sale reflect the tourist trap that it is and you'll often find better value in the local supermarket or one of the cafes down by the river. Head down the road to the wine vaults, lots of places for a coffee/tea and you might find the pirate ship, the ruined abbey and the gaol(jail) as well as pairing chicken in an astonishing location||November 7, 2016
Eric P||50||Open air market that has numerous stands and vendors selling a variety of food and drink. With all of the available choices there really is something there for everyone. We enjoyed a variety of pastries and desserts as well as a duck wrap with plum sauce...so delicious.||November 7, 2016

Shamma78||40||I love Borough Market on a Saturday afternoon. True, it can get busy and the food is quite pricey, but it's a still great place to ‘catch up’ with your friends and a great treat on Saturday.You can have a nice glass of bubbly and fresh oysters. My regular spot here for several years now is Richard Howard’s Oysters from West Mersea. If you love oysters I really recommend it – it’s a must try!You can have a fantastic boar burger, lovely paella or yummy seafood wrap and enjoy lots of free samples of fresh produce. And many, many more, just come and try…||November 7, 2016
KinkyNoodle||50||We were staying very local to the Borough Market so walked through on the Saturday afternoon. It was amazing. So many gorgeous food outlets. It was very interesting to see some with huge queues to get in while others were merely busy.The layout of the stalls was very tantalising and we'd return to get some food next time.Great place for people watching.||November 6, 2016
suzywillpower||50||Visited on a Saturday. The market was really packed. Many superb food stalls with so many things to taste and dry. Definitely recommend.||November 6, 2016
CarolienBAC||50||Borough market is the place to be for food lovers. This market is situated in a beautiful historic building and offers so many different food options that it is hard to choose between them. You simply cannot try them all. But rest assured, this means that everybody will find a dish to their liking. You can try classic British dishes, just have a coffee, tea or juice, taste some cheese or sweets or go for something more exotic, like Vietnamese or Indian food.I had scallops, oysters, slow cooked veal and organic ice cream to finish things off. All dishes were priced very reasonably. Highly recommended.||November 6, 2016
Iván Eduardo R||50||This is my favourite place in London. You can find all kind of food there, lots of colours, smells, people. This place is a joy for your senses. It is a must if you are in London and it's quite easy to get there so go on and enjoy...||November 6, 2016
SueR1605||40||Loved visiting this market but the crowds on the weekend took away from the overall experience. Try to go during the week if you want to browse in a chilled way. Don't eat before you go as there are lots of choices!||November 6, 2016
LoriAnne84||40||We went here on a Saturday afternoon. There so are many vendors. You can purchase fresh vegetables, wine, cheese, bread and more. We sipped on mulled wine while we walked around and ate delicious toast cheese sandwiches from Kappacasein. There were many more food vendors but some of them had started to close up since it was later in the day. I would recommend going closer to lunch time! But it's definitely a must see!||November 6, 2016
pamelisedawson||50||What an amazing place. I couldn't actually choose what to eat as I wanted everything. Smells and sounds and samples galore! ||November 6, 2016
tlt6788||50||I've been visiting borough market since I was in university. While I'd recommend going during the week to beat the crowds, it's an absolute must while in London! From delicious fudge to mulled wine to fresh oyster, borough market offers something for everyone. ||November 5, 2016
Ace28065||50||Amazing collection of stalls of the highest quality. Lots of wines, breads, fruits, cheeses and vegetables. Well worth a stroll around. Shut on Sunday. ||November 5, 2016
onlyifyouinsist||50||Come here with an appetite! An excellent spot to refuel after sightseeing in London - a wide range of stalls selling beautiful cheeses, breads, meats, produce, sweets, oils, etc. And then there are the food stands....oh my gosh - amazing variety and something for every palate and dietary preference. I had Ethiopian food one day and returned the next for freshly-made Indian dosa. Both were outstanding and an excellent value. I visited on a Wed and Thurs and it was crowded and lively on each day. Live music, too!||November 5, 2016
juliemurphy12016||50||It's become a bit of a tourist hot spot but the market stalls offer good value and good quality. I often see better value than the supermarket and better quality. I use London Bridge station so often get to pop by a few times a month. The food 'pop up' stands offer great quality and choice. The wine bars, restaurants and pubs in the immediate area offer great choice and quality. ||November 5, 2016
RobertChew||50||great place to explore with friends to try out the numerous street food they have there. the place feels like it's in a mess but navigating it is surprisingly easy after a while. some outstanding items we tried were the freshly shucked oysters, indian mutton with rice, scotch eggs and cod and chips. we tried a couple of other stuffs and was ok. wanted to try more stuffs but it was getting expensive to try everything and also the stomach was reaching its capacity.very interesting place to go to even if not eating. there are stalls selling various foodstuffs as well such as truffle products, teas and fresh fruits, etc.good for snacks and brunch!||November 5, 2016
TheOExpress||50||You can come here hundreds of times without ever eating the same meal. And the free samples on offer are always tasty to try. Yes it's busy but the range is unsurpassed in London. I especially like the cheap oysters, posh cheese and Spanish deli options.||November 5, 2016
micha-mud||50||A very special market as it offers no crafts or alike, but rather anything around food - from a specialized truffle place offering the smell of different truffle kinds, loads of kinds of everything - dozens of cornflower, of tomatoes, sweet potato (including a purple one), carrots - just name itYou can buy some cool stuff to take back home for an impressive dinner It's also great to have a bite of something as you stroll aroundIt can also be visited on a rainy dayMonmouth coffee nearby is one of the best!||November 4, 2016
Jamieson C||50||Awesome little market place with heaps of fab food options. Easy to come here to pick up some fresh produce or to get a lovely cake or drink. Lunch/ dinner options also available. ||November 4, 2016
K W||40||I had a great time at the Borough Market. It was in a busy and bustling area. It was extremely fun because the weather was nice and I was able to sit outside and take in the environment. Great for a 1st time (1st 24 hours) in London.||November 4, 2016
Melina G||50||There are so many options for a fresh and delicious lunch! Make sure that you go hungry and take a bag big enough to take some goodies home on the tube! There is something for everyone at every price point||November 4, 2016
Parky1974||40||Had an hour to spare before heading to the Shard and decided to pop in here. My only other experience had been walking through several months before en route to a meeting and though then it would be great place to spend some time.Mum and i had a great time wandering round the various stall, with stall holders keen for you to sample their wares!Tried and bought some fantastic foodie presents.Some great bars, restaurants and coffee shops around too.A fantastic place to wander round, especially if you're hungry!||November 4, 2016
RojBlake||50||We got to Borough Market nice and early on a Saturday morning. In fact, I don't think the market had been open for long, as it looked to us as though many stalls were still in the process of opening up and preparing for the day ahead.We started to have a wander around, and we were impressed with the range and quality of the produce that was available. We saw some fantastic looking breads, cheeses and meats which we bought for a picnic later, but there was lots more besides. It's a shame that we were limited in what we could carry home! We stayed for ages but the place became progressively busier as the morning developed. by the time we left at about 1045, it was becoming so full that it started to be a bit unpleasant. But that's hardly the market's fault. It's just so popular, and for very good reason.||November 4, 2016
Nettyrev||50||It's such an exciting vibrant place, just go and wander around, a great spot to grab something a little bit different for lunch. ||November 4, 2016
David B||40||It used to be just a very interesting bijou sort of market specialising in unusual cheeses and meats in a sort of romantic location not much known to tourists. Forget that. There are seemingly millions of them now and it is hard to get close to the stalls and sometimes even harder to even make you way through it.I suppose this is a microcosm of all the interesting places in the world.It is still an interesting place to visit, but not for shopping.||November 3, 2016
Celine F||50||Amazing! Great food and kind people. Must try the Duck confit (le marcher du quartier) and the Pad Thai.||November 3, 2016
TheSpecialOfficer||50||A lovely market with so much fresh produce, fish, meats, games, cheeses and treats! Go on an empty stomach to make sure you'll have some room to try a lot of the food they have on sale there. They have stalls cooking you fresh foods including vietnamese, pies, burgers made of venison, scallops etc. You'll leave with happy, happy taste buds and round fat belly! ||November 2, 2016
j l||40||This place has many shops and place to eat. It's a nice place to sample many different types of food. It's in the center of London and near a Metro station, so it's very easy to get to. You can do you grab a bite and go back to your site seeing in no time.||November 2, 2016
Ash2904||50||Amazing and well worth a visit. Great location great stalls great food great vibe! If you are in London Bridge it would be criminal not to visit! ||November 2, 2016
wiazanna||50||perfect place for food lovers, i am so jaleous of London to have it and Luxembourgfresh and tasty products, just grab it and cook!!!!good to taste some of the specialties from english to oriental kitchenI got my Scotch egg here! delicious||November 2, 2016
Pdxgirl2015||50||There are so many places to see and sample it's hard to fit into one visit and there are enough places to eat at a different one for at least a month. Must do is the raclette cheese place that starts with a K which apparently has recently relocated to a side location. They broil the cheese until it's bubbling and getting crispy and then scrape it onto fresh perfectly boiled potatoes - plan to share, it's very rich. Great deal for 6 pounds and they are very friendly. So many places have samples and beauitful displays. Give yourself at least two hours to take in the experience. If you want to see the food demo, get there early as the seats get taken very fast.||November 2, 2016
Globetrotter045||50||A food lover's paradise is a bit of bold statement, but the Borough Market is one of the best food markets I have ever visited. The covered market on the right sells high quality food. It is a feast to see, smell and taste all this cheese, fruits and vegetables, meats and seafood. The stalls outside sell street food from all around the world. Tip : visit the market around lunch time, you will have many options for a tasty and cheap lunch. But do come early, because it can become very crowded. If you want to visit just one market in London, let it be Borough Market.||November 2, 2016
Jonbo957||50||Very busy market but has whole food from around the World.There is something for everyone.From bread to flowers.One of the oldest market in London.||November 1, 2016
Ran H||40||I came with my wife and baby girl. Market itself is a little tricky to navigate at first, since there are a few areas.. stalls are very invitimg, and so many things look tasty.. not everything is as cheap as we expected from a food market, and the variety was impressive, but not as overwhelming as in Camden market, in my opinion.All in all, highly recommended||November 1, 2016
BabsMiller||50||Wonderful open space food market. The variety and offerings will make any foodie happy. My only fault was I didn't come hungry as I had lunch beforehand. It was still wonderful to browse through and did still enjoy a few samples that were being passed out.||November 1, 2016
MrMadMagpie||40||Borough Market is a wholesale and retail food market in Southwark and is one of the largest and oldest in London which in 2014 celebrated its 1,000th birthday. It's an amazing collection of international cuisine in a street setting. Well worth seeing.||November 1, 2016
DGSmanila||30||Nothing much in the market. Some food from around the globe.Not so cheap and not so interesting.The structure of the place is nice.||November 1, 2016
EllieG130||50||The market had all sort of goodies, from cheese, bread, seafood and cuisine from all over the world.I loved the Chorizo sandwich at Brindisa Spanish Food and the Indian Street food.||October 31, 2016
MelanieBOND||50||The market will surprise you with sumptious assortment of foods. I love the idea of trying small bites from one stalls to another with my two teenagers. Relaxed foodies everywhere in the market. Very affordable too.||October 31, 2016
magicbear||50||Primarily a food market, there is so much to see, do and taste. This is an experience not to be missed in London. Never seen it as quiet as the photo on the main picture though, usually crowded.I always go with the intention to try a new cuisine or delicacy but nearly always end up with sausages from Boston sausage, they are the best!!||October 31, 2016
jforestforever||50||Visited on a Saturday in early afternoon, with the plan of having something to eat.The bus journey from Victoria, was very easy and probably quicker than the underground.The smells of the different food being cooked at the market means choosing what you are going to eat can be quite awkward, as you really are spoilt for choice!Well worth the visit, which was followed by a quick pint in the nearby pub by the Thames and a stroll back along Southbank, made for a very nice afternoon.||October 31, 2016
IanWD||50||A great place to waste away an hour or so browsing the many different stalls. Different to you normal market this is a bit more high class.||October 31, 2016
516beckyj||50||Definitely come here. Great food whether you are after full on lunch or just a nibble. Indian dosa is not to be missed!! Full of amazing smells and tasters. Just go and have a browse! You'll end up buying something either way!! ||October 31, 2016
Curiouspavel||40||Enough said. Quite a big variety of food with different cuisines, different type of meat, veggies as well. ||October 31, 2016
635RachelO||40||Thoroughly enjoyed having a wander around here. Some wonderful things on offer- delicious breads and cheeses, tasty meats and unusual veggies. Good place for spices and teas. Just opposite London Bridge station so easy access. ||October 31, 2016
yfylou||40||I am so pleased to come back to this market again. Here you will find all kinds of local food and delicacies. Friendly service makes it a firm locals' favourite. Eat your way around with free tastings. I never leave without buying something.||October 30, 2016
justplanatrip||50||I love outdoor little markets. I try to go and see a few in the various cities that I visit. This area and market are popular in London. There is a Tube stop nearby and it is easy to get to. Check the hours that the market is open. I went for lunch during a Wednesday and there were plenty of regular area restaurants open. Tons of vendor selling anywhere from flowers, to spices, to sausages, to baked goods, to ethic foods etc., were out and operating. A fun place to visit and see what samples of culture the city has to offer! ||October 30, 2016
nickinheaton||50||Borough Marker is just one of the best places in the world! There is so much to see and so much fantastic food to enjoy and explore. I'd recommend Ethiopian Flavours for a fantastic lunch.. And if you're looking for some delicious meat to take home, try Canon & Canon... Delicious. But mainly, just explore! Oh!! Try some oysters too - tasty and cheap (for oysters!)||October 30, 2016
dede1x||40||We were walking from tower bridge to the Globe and came upon Borough Market. It present many types of food stands. The aromas were enticing and The espresso tasty. Next time we'll plan on it for a meal.||October 30, 2016
Jeff M||50||The market was packed when I visited on a Friday at lunch time. Many of the stalls were cheese stalls etc. but there was plenty else of interest. A great place to stop if you are wanting to pick up some picnic supplies. Also a good way to try some interesting food as there are a lot of nationalities represented.||October 30, 2016
Natasha T||50||A place that one wouldn't think to see. The mixture of the bricks and the steel terrific combination! The different stalls are all great. The Globe isn't far ||October 30, 2016
Jolanta A||40||A little bit crowded but interesting place for everybody, a little bit of everything, you can not only buy, you can taste and eat or drink.||October 30, 2016
Aleksey I||50||What a treat! Wonderful produce from literally around the world.Fantastic cheeses. Amazing and very "reasonably" priced white truffel.Great organic produce - vegetables.Fantastic meats, beef, all organic, local.Incredible chicken.Even the Kangooroo meat was great!Lovely people selling it - all inspired and passionate about what they have.Went to eat lunch in "Arabica" - a little hit and miss, but very good humus.But I love the market - will return soon, I hope!||October 30, 2016
scottieipad||50||I love people watching and this is the place to go. Market sellers still shouting "Strawberries £1.50 a punnet". A great place if you like food and to hang out for the afternoon. Definitely worth a visit and I have been here a few times now. ||October 30, 2016
EdEllis||50||One of the oldest markets in the U.K. Has to be seen loads of food and drink and ethnicity. Try to avoid 1 to 2pm at the weekend it's very busy and can feel a little clostraphobic with all the people.Another one of those must seen London sites ||October 30, 2016
Law1077||30||Always been a big fan of this place but my last visit this weekend was very disappointing to say the least. No personal touch anymore and produce standards seem to have slipped. What a shame||October 30, 2016
andreadG4547LD||50||I love love love borough market! You can get great incredients for cooking and enjoy the food at the market directly. Also for meat lovers, vegetarians, cheese freaks - for everybody! It is a little pricey- great!||October 30, 2016
vicrosser||50||This was a great find, so much food and really good selection to eat there and to take home really impressed, came here every week to stock up||October 29, 2016

thewillow||40||Cheese cheese and more cheese, I have never seen so much yummy cheese in one place. If you can't find something you like to eat in these markets you never will anywhere as there is so much to chose from. Also seafood, breads, meats, fruit and veggies you can buy, something for everyone. There was so many people it was a bit clostrophobic and everyone is pushing and shoving which is off putting.||October 29, 2016
brownc396||50||My son and I love going there for the atmosphere, the food, the people and most of all the adventure. There's always something new to see and the prices are quite reasonable. Love this place and never feel bored been there||October 28, 2016
Tartanfeet||50||Goat curry, fresh gnocchi with pesto, fresh fruit juices, Columbian coffee, gluten free cakes, home made jam and cream donuts, fish and chips, Thai curry, gin and prosecco bar, South African brai, bratwurst, truffle oil, French cheeses, artisan bread and at least another 100 food stalls each as good as the next. Superb and going full steam ahead on a Tuesday. Get in there ||October 28, 2016
GSAdventure91||50||Go every Christmas, without fail. The best food and drink you can find in London. Amazing hot meat sandwiches, scotch eggs and chocolate brownies!||October 28, 2016
suffolkvisitor2311||40||Had seen this market on television many times. It was the best food market I have ever visited with very pleasant people working there. The stall holders are very knowledgeable about their products. Lots of different foods to taste and purchase. Make sure you have plenty of time to look around so nothing is missed. Bought a few items which were as good as they looked. I am sure it will be lovely leading up to Christmas. In a very good tourist area with lots to see within walking distance.||October 28, 2016
575emmal||50||I love borough market. From all the street food vendors offering every known and unknown delicacy available around the world, to the more traditional market stall for fresh fruit and veg. Everything is set out beautifully. It's noisy and bustling. Pulse you can peruse whilst drinking champagne. Best advise if you don't like the crowds is to avoid lunch time as it can get very busy. ||October 27, 2016
davethesuede||50||I walk by Borough Market when I'm down in London in business, so decided to explore with the family at lunchtime. Saw some great produce, including things I'd never seen before - different varieties of tomatoes, yellow courgettes. Stopped off at an Argentinian stall for empanadas as a snack, got a vegetarian thali to share, and bought cheese and rye bread for later.Food lovers in the area, check it out.||October 27, 2016
amvann||50||A delight to wander through. The variety and quality of food is amazing. We sampled the best coffee we have had in a long time and bought too much very delicious Turkish Delight.||October 27, 2016
artyemm||50||Now getting very busy, especially on the main Friday / Saturday trading days, but.. one of the best places in London to see how we Brits have discovered how to properly do (1) good food, (2) slow food (in a good way, meaning all locally sourced), (3) street market excitement, (4) diversity. At its best, romantic, exotic, friendly, always surprising. Packed though - don't expect to get round it quickly - but then again why would you want to?!||October 27, 2016
Davidstays||50||A great place to eat and drink, I came on a Saturday with my wife. The smell here is unbelievable, so good! We had a couple of beers and some food. If you are in the area well worth a visit! ||October 27, 2016
629adrianb||50||This place never ceases to delight. The range and quality are consistently impressive. I love the German deli and nearby shop where I stock up on Currywurst sauce and German mustard.Bring a big shopping bag and a good appetite!||October 27, 2016
MontfortOaks||50||This is one of the best places to have lunch in London. I walked around to check out the food and decided to line up at the longest line.... Ethiopian food and it was great. I liked the vibe of the market. There were a lot of people (not too crowded) and you could just find a spot to stand and eat your food. People in suit do the same. London is amazing!||October 26, 2016
globelsaint||50||I highly recomend this market for the variety of local dishes and treats. Also very international and you can find tastes of all minorities. Very suitable to get the real tastes of london. Good to walk from covent garden or leighcaster square. Good walking route lassing througj the globe theather and thames. Good place to hang in the afger ion but be aware adter 16:30 most of the shops and barracks close. I also tried fresh oyster there was fantastic. ||October 26, 2016
jimmyjam67||40||Well needless to say I am biased, however speak as I find I was raised and brought up in Southwark so in my opinion this is the best market i have ever visited, The food, The Culture combined with the fact the variety on show. This is a must place to visit be warned before hand don't eat or drink until you arrive far to much to choose from a great day out and even better for an evening drink by the Thames great to see the old Borough market thriving and doing well well done to all "a very proud cockney I am" . A MUST DO FOR EVERYONE !||October 26, 2016
Mandy20132013||50||This market is buzzing with activity. it is a must to visit on a visit to London. It has an interesting crafts area , lots of choice of street food and great vegetable displays. Good coffee shops and bars are also to be found in the area.||October 26, 2016
wanlass2||50||I visited here a few weeks ago, the first time in 10 years, what changes!! It's an incredible place for all things foodie, from many types of street food, to sampling produce & buying treats to take home, the possibilities are endless! It definitely has a wide range of food which caters for all, but it does become incredibly busy at lunchtimes. I would recommend not eating before the visit as too much choice. In fact I enjoyed it so much I'm returning this week while in London.||October 26, 2016
KeenDav||50||Came here on a weekday afternoon (so not sure how crowded it is weekend). It was a big market with lots of food options from a lot of different countries. We had a mushroom chicken pie and mash, humus and Ethiopian cuisine. We liked all of them and each was approx 4-5 pounds for a full meal. We can't wait to go again and would highly recommend coming here when you are in the area of Tower of London. There aren't to many places to seat however which is my one minus. ||October 26, 2016
Bev H||50||We arrived at 9.45 and some of the stall holders were only just setting up, however, there were still plenty of things to look at. Plenty of food stalls to grab a snack, breakfast and lunch.Lovely old ' building,.||October 25, 2016
Andythebaggie||50||My first visit here for a late luncheon, and it's definitely a place I'll be heading back to next time I'm in the capital. Great range of food vendors, with cuisines from all round the world. I had to walk round a couple of times before managing to make my mind up as to what to have! Settled on a paella with Catalan stew and meatballs, very yummy. My bro also had some rock oysters a bargain at £1.50 each. There are some great specialist stalls here too. Phil purchased some powerful matured sheep cheese to eat later at the hotel. I enjoyed the Tea2you stall and purchased some oolong. Returned to the market in the evening as there are some fantastic pubs in the area. The Market Porter is a proper and very busy London boozer, the Rake one of the pioneers of craft ale is also well worth a visit. Plenty more epic pubs within half a mile too. Also some of the area familiar to those who have seen the Bridget Jones movies! ||October 25, 2016
Eddie C||50||Good variety of stalls including food, drink, produce and confectionery. There was even children's entertainment with actors when we visited!||October 25, 2016
ladysystad||50||I have been to many markets around the world, but this is definately one of the best I have ever visited. The atmosphere, the quality of food and drink and also the variety is just amazing. My husband and I enjoyed everything and tasted a lot of very tasty food from all corners of the world. All the suppliers did their best to keep us as customers happy. Everything was very fresh and delicate. The food market is not far from London Bridge so one should also take the time to go across the bridge and enjoy the lovely view.I would definately go back next time I visit London to try more of the lovely food and drink.||October 25, 2016
maxrQ2049AT||50||Been here several times over the years when working in London.It's a thriving well know market with many shops and stalls. A wide selection and for something to eat at lunch time. A great cheese shopAround the market are good pubs and places to eat. Noodles placesBlue (steak)Fish (fish!)Characterful pubsA real ale pub And Vinopolis for wine, whisky and gin tasting .

VTJedi||50||Lots of amazing produce, cheeses, wines, meats, and everything you could imagine. It can get a little pricey quick so watch your spending - ha! Lots of good coffee shops, roman ruins, and hidden goodies in the surrounding area. This is a great place to find stuff for a picnic lunch!||October 23, 2016
Phillip S||50||If you love food markets then this is the place to go. This market has many samples to try and a great selection of organic food. The days to go are Thurs-Sun. ||October 23, 2016
Robert R||50||My wife and I went here for lunch when we were in London and we really loved it. My wife had curry from Gujarati Rasoi and I had fish and chips at the outdoor fish and chip counter from Fish. It was the best fish and chips I had all week and my wife thought the same thing about her Indian food. This should be a must stop for anyone looking for an affordable lunch in London. ||October 23, 2016
472kellya||40||Loved this market. Large variety of produce, cheese and meat vendors. But the highlight were all of the food vendors. I wish we had gone here for lunch, but we opted to get a bread pudding dessert to take with us back to our hotel as a late night treat, and my god was it good!!||October 23, 2016
Frank-1972-06||40||We - my wife and our teenage son - loved to go arround and get inspired to taste different kinds of food at Borough Market. ||October 23, 2016
Stuart W||40||Visited this on a Friday and was able to get around well and visit all the stalls, returned on the Saturday to make some purchases and it was rammed! to be expected but was very hard to get around and to the stall although we did manage to get what we wanted, Lots of nice cheese, meats and bakery goods here to be had would defiantly return again||October 23, 2016
dilayo2016||50||Do you want to make a feast for your stomach with a reasonable budget? Then, go to Borough Market and go everyday! There are many stands selling all kinds of food and stuff... But what I loved is the streetfood stands from many different cuisines and spreading the inviting delicious smell to the air. If it is your first time, you are very hungry and open to all kinds of tastes, then you have a hard time to decide. I walked up and down many times to decide what to eat. It is a must if you visit London.||October 23, 2016
SaimiriSA||40||This was fun to visit and the food was great. There were some nice vegetarian options, vegan options, and even one booth (possibly more) that had gluten free, egg free, and/or sugar free, baked goods. (Though that said, I'm not sure how easy it would be to keep the baked goods gluten free in that scenario.) It was super busy on a Saturday afternoon in October.||October 22, 2016
KimberlyM459||40||This was very high on my list for London. We came on Saturday. There are many vendors and it's got a good energy but it wasn't what I expected. Maybe I expected too much. We ate several good things; the best was chicken empanadas and we took home desserts. Things were expensive and there's no place to sit so you have to walk around eating your food. I would go again.||October 22, 2016
Mason A||30||The market itself is nice to walk around, albeit quite busy (expect people walking below a snails pace and stopping directly in front of you). a sensory overload of beautiful smells, all the produce looks fantastic, with a variety of things to choose from, meats, cheese, licorice, fudge, wines etc, though it's been jacked up to tourist prices, while you're support market farmers, it's more you're paying for Borough Market than to support a local farmer, if you have the cash to spend, it's worth a visit.||October 22, 2016
ofrit_manor||50||A lovely and genuine place. It has a unique atmosphere and it is great to walk around, feel the different scents all over, and taste a verity of food. You can buy food for home or snacks to eat. I will definitely return there. ||October 21, 2016
Lin2482013||50||Great place to meet with girlfriend to catch up on life! Lovely food galore just the stomach said no way but eyes said no problem!!!!||October 21, 2016
Bea K||50||Love this place. There is an unbelievable variety of prepared food items, produce, and baked goods. Interesting and fun!||October 21, 2016
BRCanning||30||This market would be terrific if not for the crowds and huge line. A 20 person line for a Pad Thai stall?! Has no one in London had Thai food before?Do not go on a weekend and do not go at the lunch hour. You can barely move. That said, everything looks and smells great.||October 21, 2016
670alanm||50||The stalls are so varied with produce from all over the world. It has a great atmosphere and is very busy. A must do thing in London.||October 21, 2016
VictoriaW315||50||Love this market. Open Monday to Saturday with great food available. Also the amazing Spice Mountain.||October 21, 2016
Steve2006Dublin||50||I came across a recommendation for the Borough Food Market in the London Time Out web site, while doing research before travelling to London. I was staying at the Mondrian, just below Blackfriars Bridge and this market is located just beyond Tate Modern, before Tower Bridge and opposite St. Pauls on the south bank of the Thames. We visited it on a Friday, just after arriving in London. It had a great buzz and was an ideal lunch pit stop for two hungry travellers. There are 50+ stalls offering a wide range and variety of British, Asian, African and European food with some American food (Louisiana gumbo etc.) thrown in. There is a great variety of fresh produce on sale, cooked and uncooked, including fish, meats, vegetables, ciders, cheeses, breads, coffees, ice-creams, cakes and patisseries. Not enough room here to go into the details, but, it would kill the surprise anyway! Open till 5pm daily, but, check the times. It gets very busy at lunch time. I would recommend to arrive with empty stomachs as there is much food and drink tasting on offer, before, you decide on different courses, starting with a first taster of the day. We split everything in half so that we’d have enough space sample as much food and drink as possible. There are great colours and mouth-watering smells. There are also good tea, great coffee, mulled-wine and fruit juice stands to wash down the food and some nearby pubs for beer! Other cities have tried this type of food market, but. The Borough Market works. Well worth a visit for the hungry tourist at lunch-time!||October 21, 2016
Lise K||50||Highly recommended. We had good food and drinks there; fresh mussels and prosecco followed by a green detoxing smoothie and lovely sandwiches. Great fresh food and anything you need for a good meal. A lot of traders that let you taste their products of cheese, sausages, ham etc. ||October 21, 2016
SevenoaksSinjun||40||Close to London Bridge rail station, the River Thames embankment path and the Shard Tower, this is a very popular semi covered market full of stalls selling mainly artisan foods. All sorts of nice stuff for sale - hams, spices, fish, lots of cheese stalls etc. There are also stalls selling food to ready to eat that you can take away and enjoy while perhaps sitting in the adjacent Cathedral grounds. There are also a couple of nice pubs there too. Very good.||October 20, 2016
Night_Bridge1||50||Borough market is a lovely little place offering a variety of foods including exotic foods such as kangaroo burger and as well as offering a variety of drinks.||October 20, 2016
ofra01||40||Everything you've read about Borough Market is true. It is unique and varied and fun to spend time there. As vegetarians we were careful to avoid areas where it seems that butcher shops/stalls were abundant. There was a mouth-watering fruit and vegetable store with a selection of very unique products, and there were even street-food stalls that were completely vegetarian. What was planned as a quick walk-through turned into a full hour of happily exploring and enjoying. Regretfully our hotel did not have any facilities for storing or cooking, so we could only enjoy with our eyes.||October 20, 2016
Cynthia G||50||This place is so much fun. Walk around and be amazed at all the food products, produce, meats, fishes, cheeses, wines etc. etc. There is also all kinds of food stalls with cooked foods to enjoy from Ethiopian to Indian to Southern BBQ and so much more. Very entertaining and mouth watering place. A must see. ||October 19, 2016
rememiranda||50||I live around and I love this market so much! I never get tired of it. You find everything you need in the many many stalls they have -- it is curious to pass by the area when the stalls are not there, it seems much smaller --||October 19, 2016
djw1955||50||Wow, the market is a wonderful place to visit, excellent food etc on sale and a great atmosphere with wonderful staff to assist. A really enjoyable visit. Thanks!||October 19, 2016
GDane||50||Food lovers’ paradise with terrific street food from all over the world and a great selection of small gourmet shops. Visit to soak up the great atmosphere even if you don’t buy anything.||October 19, 2016

wanderers_2011||50||We did a food tasting/walking tour of the Market. It was about 2-1/2 hours of the most delicious foods I've tasted along with lots of history. Our tour guide was fabulous!||October 18, 2016
ErnieKo||50||love the people, love the local fresh food, you can taste the local flavour of London at this market. all sorts of grocery purchase you can get from here fresh! ||October 18, 2016
STK R||50||Borough Market is a foodies dream, fresh and vibrant, all sorts of foods on sale, all sorts of drink on sale ranging from specialist wines to hand made smoothies. Lots of cafes as well.||October 18, 2016
MrBrian007||40||Visited the market, wandered around the food stalls, reminded me of a smaller Barcelona market. Found a good restaurant to eat. Made a nice afternoon ||October 18, 2016
EmmyLex||50||Borough Market is great on a Saturday with tons of gourmet street food stalls as well as those selling other produce. It's a totally different atmosphere to anywhere else in London and is such a fun place to visit. Bread ahead's doughnuts, Le Marche du Quartier's confit duck sandwich and Brindisa's chorizo rolls are to die for. ||October 18, 2016
Alison F||50||A must visit whilst in London, This market is host to all tastes and senses. A bustling marketplace where food from all ethnicities and tastes are on offer. From bread, cheese,jams, pickles, curries, tappas, fresh fruit and veg including some weird and wonderful sausages. A real treat not to be missed,||October 18, 2016
Philip E||40||This is a great lively very old established market for all things food and drink, lovely atmosphere and has a very much continental feel to it. Ideal to taste many different things not readily available in supermarkets and with all of the usual market banter. There are some really fantastic street food outlets and numerous pubs, cafe's on the periphery. If food and drink is your thing then it's a must visit in London. The challenge is getting round through the huge number of people who go there...on my visit it was ultra busy.||October 18, 2016
Andre R||50||The best place to go and have a street food!This market it's simply amazing with their variations of street food where you can get Traditional English food and from all around the world! Don't go on Sundays and Mondays because most of the food it's not there! Recommend for lunch time and before 3pm!||October 18, 2016
vmmh||50||A wonderful market with lots of food stalls and also shops with the freshest produce, meats and seafood. Great place for lunch. Food porn central!||October 17, 2016
CoxieandBaggy||50||This is a must visit destination in London. Many different stalls selling street food, cheeses, wine, meat, etc, etc... Surrounded by pubs, restaurants. You could spend a few hours here if you're eating and drinking. Great fish and chips, good restaurants like Fish. A great vibe in the heart of London.||October 17, 2016
Therealthing123||50||Would absolutely recommend a visit to Borough Market, we visited with friends last Saturday and it was buzzing! Loads of hot food stalls, so much variety! Tried various Cheese, bread, oils etc, great just wandering, nibbling and taking in all the lovely aromas. We had a sit down in a great little wine bar and after a couple of drinks we were off again. Looking forward to visiting again in the not too distant future Note: it's closed on Sundays.||October 17, 2016
SunilNambiar||50||A hop off a Thames ferry stop, Borough Market is a veritable Foodies' paradise. There are so many stalls of exciting food and drink to try from all over Europe. We had fish and chips from one the stalls and it was truly yummy. And then you have cheese and meat of a thousand kinds....and well stocked wine stalls too. A bmust visit.||October 17, 2016
wildrover1953||10||Sitting in there is like sitting in a greenhouse - they have AC but dont turn it on? Sunday roast doesnt include much roast - the menu is different to the website so very disappointing!! Venison is not good - very tough - not good for the price!! Pork wasnt much better - all in all very bad wont be returning!||October 16, 2016
Jimmuswell||50||This market has come a long way from when I was a child. Today it is thriving market with a complete cross section of quality products and services on offer, mainly food related. I didn't count them, but there must be well over 100 trader in the market, plus several pubs and restaurants around the edge and in the surrounding streets. Well worth a visit.||October 16, 2016
Stuart60||40||--If you love anything to do with food, . My tip is not to buy at the first stall you come to ---arrive early while you can still look around and talk to the stall holders and discuss their samples -arrive late and you are carried along with the crowds and miss everything. Fantastic place to source unusual ingredients or try new foods. Fascinated by the wonderful, colourful vegetable displays---a feast for your senses||October 16, 2016
BcMc_11||40||Loved it! Go early to see the fresh produce and talk to the vendors as after 10.30 it's pretty packed.It's in danger of becoming a tourist trap and signs of that are showing with the amount and quality of some of the cooked food vendors but it still has plenty of gems to discover.The food highlight - a grilled cheese sandwich with 4 different cheeses & braised leeks on Poulaine sourdough chased with a warm jam filled doughnut from one of the many bakery stalls.Beautiful seafood, cheese, fresh bread and seasonal vegetables make it a visual paradise and well worth a few hours time and all the additional calories.||October 16, 2016
Freddykins||50||You cannot help but be intrigued by some of the offerings on the numerous foodie stalls in Borough Market. From various cheeses (too numerous to mention) to Chilli Squid, a myriad of truffle oils, fish, meat and veg stalls and some of the quirkiest ever pumpkins and squashes that I've ever seen! Only problem here for me was what to do with all the goodies that I bought whilst continuing with our day in London! A great place to while away a few hours - although be warned - it does get incredibly busy and you will likely lose whoever accompanies you on your visit!!||October 15, 2016
yvonneyeo185||50||For food lovers, especially those who cook, this place is heaven!Recommend to go in groups cos I went alone and tummy got filled up too quickly! Shop around for the cheapest deals for oysters! I've got 2 huge, 2 med, 2 small rock oysters and 1 native oyster for £10.Go hungry! Go early! Shopkeepers have more time to talk to you when you're there early, and you get to beat the queue!||October 15, 2016
RobO1278||50||My wife and I were in London early October. After exploring the Tower of London, we decided to walk over the London Bridge and explore the Borough Market. We were glad we did, it was an easy walk, and we were quite hungry when we got there. They had so many food stands serving all types of cuisine! The smells were amazing, and we quickly got to exploring our options. My wife has to eat gluten free and they had a stand (Free From Bakery), that had gf savory tarts, and lots of sweet items. She loved everything she got there. I had a small steak pie from Pieminister, and it was delicious. We spent about an hour wandering around and checking out all of the stalls and stores. We were so glad we made the time to walk over the bridge. It was an excellent experience! Lot's of restaurants there too, including Roast and Fish, so you can go for a sit down meal as well.||October 15, 2016
M2bfx||50||After an amazing trip up the chard in London, which by chance is right next door to the famous borough market, a mix of fresh food, fish, veg and just about anything else. The smells are amazing and an amazing time out for all the family. Fresh food cooked in front of your eyes daily, however check the website as some stalls only open on certain days. Shame it's over 300 miles away from my home, and I would make this my weekend haven......||October 15, 2016
MarkCilia1||50||I live in a small country called Malta. Although we have everything we need (hence I should not complain) there is no variety in food. Hence when I came here and saw this my head just exploded. A must visit either if you are a foodie or not and leave 3 hours availability in order to experience as much food as possible. Well done to the organisers how place is presented.||October 15, 2016
monaalbaghli||50||It was a lovely experience to walk through borough market. The food selection was great to accommodate whatever you like. Fish, meat, vegetarian, gluten free, dairy free and more. Basically its a food lovers heaven whether you want to grab quick lunch or buy groceries to take home. Go hungry!||October 15, 2016
325seang||50||My wife had never visited, today she was like a child in a sweet shop, the variety of stalls and cuisine is outstanding. If you like cheeses this is a must, but overall food is superb. ||October 14, 2016
mikemoreton||50||We walked around for some time and not once did we get hassled or a hard sell. Some really amazing food available.||October 14, 2016
Holidays_for_us_2016||50||We thoroughly enjoyed our recent visit to the Borough Market. We spent an hour or so looking around at the interesting stalls and the delicious fresh produce and then grabbed a bite to eat - the choices are endless! My son was fascinated with 'Shellseekers Fish & Game' which not only had fresh seafood and shellfish but an impressive selection of game, much of it shot by the owner of the stall. Highly recommend a visit to this wonderful market!||October 14, 2016
EricR28||50||Amazing gem of a place.Nice and clean.Good quality produce.Lots of freebies (sample before you buy).Fruit, cheese, hot sauce, pate, fudge, Turkish delight, coffee... Well that's what I bought.Bring plenty of money and buy lots of stuff - that's what we did.So you have spent a small fortune and filled your rucksack. Grab a sausage sandwich when you go and save a few quid on lunch.All in all a great way to spend a few hours.||October 14, 2016
Legraz||50||A visit to the Borough Market is a must for anyone when in London. There's a huge variety of places to eat and the prices are reasonable. I love it.||October 14, 2016
kerryncwj||50||The sheer variety of stalls and food options here boggles the mind. Yes, it's filled with tourists. No, that doesn't make it any less worth a visit if you are a foodie and love to tempt your senses with the sights, sounds, and smells of desserts and cuisines galore. There was so much to choose from that I honestly wish I had more time to visit this place in London a second time, just so I could give some of the other stalls a try. There are so many amazing treats on offer that it's impossible to recommend any one thing in particular; there's always something for everyone. My only tip would be to go on a Saturday as I have heard that more stalls are open then (although it will also be more crowded).||October 13, 2016
Jane S||50||What a delight this market is, so many beautiful, delicious and super smelly items. Great place to buy gifts for Christmas as well. Cheeses, breads, olives, meats, pickles, fruit , vegetables so many to name, A must for anyone and so near to London Bridge Station||October 13, 2016
pighunter8||40|| A short walk from Blackfriars to these markets great for all your staples from bread to meats and cheeses Inc seafood all top quality. It can get extremely busy but definitely worth a look. Check out the stalls have a feed have a chat||October 13, 2016
Jesse F||50||The Borough Market was recommended to me by two locals and it was well worth it! The food was genuine and it was a great cultural experience.||October 13, 2016
carlton69||50||I was travelling mainly to visit the Shard, and literally underneath it is this awesome gem! I have no idea how big the market is as it was absolutely packed solid, and i mean busy busy busy - but without spoiling any surprises it was a gastronomic treat - independent stalls bursting at the seams, it wasnt cheap, but certainly a place that i would love to live next door to - awesome place - probs a better experience that the Shard if your a foodie.||October 13, 2016
Whitnee B||50||Amazing experience. So many options and things to try. There was something for everyone. One of my favorites was the Kappasein Cheese Toastie sandwich! It was better than I could have imagined. It's filled with cheese and is worth each bite. Definitely go in hungry because you will want to try so many things. We took a number of cheeses back to the hotel to try that night.||October 12, 2016
blushandbook||50||Borough Market was bustling on a Tuesday afternoon! It smelled absolutely divine . . . I could not decide what to feast on first!We settled on a savoury asparagus pie from Pieminister (smothered in red wine gravy), and stood next to Southwark Cathedral to eat. Delicious . . . and the view couldn't be beat. It was definitely a "pinch me" moment . . . the sparkling sunlight, scents and sounds of the London food market and a gorgeous gothic cathedral.We also bought some massive meringues and local cheese. All the vendors were more than happy to chat about their wares - which I really enjoyed.If you are a foodie you will absolutely love visiting Borough Market - I would place it at the top of my eating experiences in London. It's a super short detour from Tower of London or Shakespeare's Globe - a 2 min walk south of the London bridge.||October 12, 2016
John W||50||I have been going to Borough market since I first saw it on Jamie Oliver's TV programme. It is a lively, bustling and very interesting market. Fresh quality produce is on sale so it is a working market where you can buy your provisions. It also has lots of cafe's coffee shops and bars. I love the area and it is a great position to visit lots of attractions.||October 12, 2016
Natalia W||50||Totally worth a visit! Products range is very wide (food to go, cheese, wine, jams, vegetables and fruit, meat, fish, etc) and the place is vibrant and fascinating.||October 12, 2016
Jonhayes||50||The choice of food is excellent. There are so many stalls with excellent produce from UK and around world. Some lovely places to eat||October 12, 2016
Ducknzzz||40||To many shops and the street food vendors have been pushed to the back.. The food though was very good and fair priced. but watch out closed Mondays and the crowds can get intense.||October 12, 2016
Brian C||50||From the shard , short walk to market. Wide selection of food, we had pie and mash. Good price and delicious.||October 12, 2016
Rury_Glasgow||50||As a chef I love this place its fantastic array of foods from around the world from spices and cheese to game, meats and fish it is just fantastic to visit. And with so many stalls selling a beautiful array of food from around the globe its a great place to stop for lunch I always stop by when in London.||October 12, 2016
Peter R||40||Eaten in many of the restaurants, bought from many of the stalls a great place to visit and just wander, or sit and watch the world go by. The place is heaving most days so don’t need to be in a hurry.||October 12, 2016
whimsicalbuyer||40||We went there on a Thursday shortly after 1 pm. Borough Market is across the road from the nearest tube station exit. However, the road crossing is unsheltered (although much of Borough Market is sheltered), and you may want to take this into consideration on a rainy day. We were there with a stroller and like most of the toilets in UK, the baby changing station is only at the disabled toilet near the entrance of the market. It is possible to push a stroller around the market (roads are mostly level) but I would advise against it on a crowded day.We ate from several stalls and also purchased fruit and bread. It was a good visit and we would have visited again if we had the time.||October 12, 2016
Alessandra G||50||We usually go here for street food, and believe me it's worth it!! you can taste so many different kind of food here, all delicious! The quality is high, a lot of people around but we always managed to find a spot to sit and enjoy. You can also shop at the market, prices are quite high but the quality is also fantastic!||October 12, 2016
SallyZohney||50||As someone who loves food, culture and outdoor spaces this place was perfect for me. If I am living in London I would easily find myself spending mornings there. The market offers a rich variety of bakery, cheese, fresh fruit and local food, there are many good coffee shops around. It is best if you take your time around, take many rounds till you find your best meal. I enjoyed very much little talks with shop owners and vendors on their products.||October 12, 2016
Wanda110||40||We visited Borough market on a busy Saturday morning.It was crowded and vibrant.Lots of interesting food stalls, flower stalls ,fresh fruit and veg, and deli shops,and much more.It is not the cheapest place ,but it is fascinating.We had a great coffee in a quirky cafe opposite The Globe pub, famous for being Bridget Jones home in the film.Make sure you go hungry.||October 11, 2016
Josh G||50||This is a large market full of fresh, locally produced food. It seemed very popular with locals; this isn't one of those markets that turns out to be endless souvenir and T-shirt sales. Food is the focus--produce, cheese, seafood, raw meat. Several stalls sell ready-to-eat lunch or breakfast items. This would be a great place to eat lunch in between visiting museums or other tourist sites--it's a much better option than any cafe built into a museum.||October 11, 2016
nicole r||50||This is a hidden gem in a part of London you might not be in ordinarily. Worth the trip. We went on a Saturday and it was super crowded. Plan to spend at least two hours. Take your time to walk the market and decide what food to get. Prepare to be overwhelmed. BRING CASH. There is a ATM on premises. There are also public toilets. The salt beef sandwich was the best. Candy and desserts abound. Sangria and cider everywhere. The cider is funky! Not what you're used to, especially if you're American. Great place to buy fresh produce, meat and fish if you're going to be cooking. If you are traveling - prepare to check a bag or bring a cooler for your car. So many British items you're going to want to bring home with you. ||October 11, 2016

Sheila D||40||This is a wonderful food market with a choice for everyone. We had goat kaftas, camel burger and pasta followed by the most delicious pastries. Wine etc is available. We visited on a Saturday with our teenagers. It was crowded but that just adds to the atmosphere. It's close to the South Bank and the Tate Modern so it can be part of a great day out in London||October 10, 2016
jonathanbR1270WJ||50||We stayed in a hotel nearby and every morning we passed through Borough Market on our way to the Tube station. The selection of foods on offer is mouth watering with something on offer for everyone from traditional sausages, fresh fruit and veg, freshly squeezed juices to seafood paella and stewsRecommendation:A coffee from Monmouth coffee shop is a must first thing in the morningA real must for a foody experience||October 10, 2016
paulhQ7268FO||40||Lots of think to try and eat, a must for a goody. Only really way to get to area is by public transport , tube or bus. Area is surround by very narrow and tight roads so no way to park . Just a amazing place to visit .||October 9, 2016
Demonsden||50||This is where all the locals come to buy their produce, meats, breads, etc. Also a great place to sample of the of the local delights.||October 9, 2016

Brian M||30||Having seen one vendor early one morning with a sack of supermarket carrots a bucket of water and a bucket of soil create "homemade" organic carrots one has to wonder. Some of the stalls are good others not so and very expensive. One thing I can never understand is the health standards that apply to bakery shops are very strict, yet here comes and bread out in the open air with people smoking as they pass by. How so? Choose carefully and wisely, all is not as it seems.||October 9, 2016
Rachel_PRL||50||Love the market, lots of good quality gourmet food, cheese, truffles oil, breads, street food. Best to go on empty stomach||October 8, 2016
Kaymarie B||50||Borough Market is very bang on trend, Busy with good vibe to it ,. Try the Mushroom pate this is delicious and buy some to take home , Seems to be a Borough Market must have Street food also really good plenty of choice, most dishes are around 7.00 portion.Great setting too one of oldest markets in London.Easy to get to as under arches at London Bridge.||October 8, 2016
chiccanadianchick||50||Get your camera and appetite ready! This is a must see for any foodie. Fast food carts (with vegan options) and market ingredients perfect to make any meal. Lots of samples available. The pastry carts are my favourite, but a good stop for souvenirs as well. ||October 8, 2016
ZoeBailey72||50||When we come up to London for the day, we always come in to London Bridge so that we can walk straight down to Borough Market and have breakfast and then we take our time wandering around the food stalls sampling what takes our fancy. I always get lost, which is great for finding new treasures but soooo frustrating when you're looking for something!! When I brought my friend up last month, she spent a fortune on cheese and was dead excited to find the Ginger Pig stall as she loves their cookbooks (she runs The Wooden Spoon in Downton.... check them out in my reviews!!) We were both really pleased to find the Taste Croatia stall as well after having been there for a holiday earlier in the year as they stock the wine we fell in love with. Too many stalls to tell you all about it here, but if you love food, you will love Borough Market. Plus there's plenty more to do in the area as well||October 8, 2016
Scott_H403||50||Honestly, I hated London. But the Borough Market was awesome! Definitely the highlight of my stay in London. So many little places to check out. The cheese and oils and meats places with samples were delicious. Fresh squeezed juices are a must! Also, there is a bakery there that sells gigantic filled doughnuts, I cant remember the name of it, but when you see these doughnuts, you will know you're at the right place. Quite possibly the best doughnut I have ever had!||October 8, 2016
Nils L||40||Great place for street food and specialties. Bread, cheese sausage from wherever you like. A lot of vegetarian/ vegan food as well. You'll like it!||October 8, 2016
Theofilos M||40||Great food market, increasingly gastronomic, fantastic selection and variety. Love the hot duck sandwiches, or just buying cheese and order some wine outside. ||October 8, 2016
Eva N||50||This is a combination of street food and gourmet market. The pricing is normal and the variety unique. The Colombian coffee place is something to pick you up after the long Thames walk - or before||October 8, 2016
877erikad||50||This market was recommended to us by friends and I saw it on trip advisor. The amount of fresh meats, cheeses, breads, sweets and everything in between was like nothing I've ever seen or experienced! It was such a unique experience for a Florida girl. We purchased cured pork sliced, fresh cheese, fresh artisan bread and a bottle of prosecco and had a delicious feast! This is somewhere we will go first on our next trip to London so we can have the treats to enjoy for our whole trip! ||October 7, 2016
Thani404||50||If you live in London love food & don't visit borough market u may need your head examined. The fruit veg preserves bakery etc on offer is enough to return ever so often to stock up with homemade/ unique items that your supermarket can never provide. My children love exploring and choosing food that they would normally ignore.Located in the arches under London Bridge it's easy to get to ....||October 7, 2016
emilybd6||50||Borough market encapsulates the cultural mosaic that is London. Great food, great atmosphere! Would definitely recommend for any foodie ||October 7, 2016
Kristin V||50||If you don't know what to get for dinner you will find inspiration at this marked. If you don't know what to get for lunch you will find something to suit your palate. Try kangaroo burgers at the exotic meat stand, or maybe wheatgrass juice at the juice stand. I always go here for lunch everytime I visit London, and always enjoy it.||October 7, 2016
lrnnnn||50||A popular market with a huge variety of stalls to buy groceries (oils, dips, bread, cheese, cakes, pastries etc.) or to grab food to eat straight away. It gets very busy, so be prepared to move through crowds & wait in line at the popular food stalls. I particularly recommend Veggie Table for fresh & filling vegetarian/vegan burgers & Balkan Bites for delicious bourek served with houmous, chickpeas, tahini, olive oil & pitta.||October 6, 2016
mollyw901||50||My husband and I ALWAYS visit Borough Market whenever we get to London. This place is big and busy and amazing. Many, many options to view, try and eat for lunch. There are two spaces here so if you hit the main market, be sure not to miss out on the "Green Market" which connected by-way-of passageway in the back. Back there is more street food and is also home of, what my husband believes, is the best brownie in the world. Our other favorite foods are the sausage rolls, cheeses, Pimms Cocktails () and truly yummy, chicken curry and seafood paella. My husband also swears by the venison burgers. Honestly though, you will find so many more choices to suit every taste. Enjoy! ||October 6, 2016
eb10783||50||This is the best food market I have ever been to and I didn't even know it existed. There are so many stalls of exciting food to try from all over the globe. We had gumbo with mac and cheese. It is pricey but the portions are huge. We shared one portion and it was £6.50. Make sure you visit on your next London trip. ||October 6, 2016
stepheng443||50||Great place to taste your way through many cultures foods and drinks.Throw yourself in to the many food stalls for all the best tasting flavours in London.Fantastic place we loved it ||October 6, 2016
Helly21||40||Great place to wander on a Saturday afternoon. It's always busy, but as long as you prepare yourself mentally for that it's fine! Bring plenty of cash (not credit cards) so you can sample lots of the foodie delights the many different vendors have to offer. It's covered so rain or shine a good place to visit. ||October 6, 2016
Peter C||50||I have visited the Borough Market several times during visits to London and I am still fascinated at what goes on. My recent visit was made during the week and I was still surprised at the very wide range of produce and foods available. Yes the market was crowded but every stall holder was polite and very friendly. The sights, smells and atmosphere of the market make a visit an interesting experience. I had lunch at the market and really enjoyed my beef sandwich.||October 5, 2016
Brad K||50||This is such a cool market. Tons of vendors in an outdoor, but covered, market setting. I loved going to lunch there every day during a recent visit.||October 5, 2016
Sara F||50||Very good food from all the world. Many ingredients, fresh street food, perfect cakes, but it is better to visit about 11 hours and then lunch. In the afternoon there is a lot of people. Very good restaurant inside FISH restaurant - the best Fish and chips||October 5, 2016
keith j||50||well worth the visit amongst all the different stalls selling breads meat and fish also street food very vibrant||October 5, 2016
KJT-AJT||50||Visited on the recommendation of a colleague and wasn't disappointed. The sights, sounds and delicious smells of the multitude of street food offerings and artisan products was a pleasant assault on the senses. The huge variety of food on offer was stunning - if we lived nearby we would visit regularly and just round the corner is a lovely walk along the embankment so well worth a visit.||October 5, 2016
Bumble_Be3||30||It's a place to hang out in the afternoon. We went to this place to experience new things for our lunch. There are many things that you can see on this place. We had Ethiopian cuisine for our lunch and we're not impressed at all. It's just like mixed rice with veggie. A lot of things are pricey such as juice, cheese, etc at this Borough Market and not worth to get. The toilet facilities are filthy and would not advise to use it.NOTES: seats are available at this place but limited - so be prepared to just stand up while enjoying your food.||October 5, 2016
L3K||40||We visited on a Saturday lunchtime, and it was busy busy busy. There was a wide choice, but for my money, I preferred the smaller, and quieter, Maltby St market.||October 5, 2016
RobinB1957||40||Visited on a sunny Saturday afternoon in early October and spent an enjoyable hour or so wandering around the various stalls which are primarily situated beneath or within a junction of three railway lines.Very busy and lots of interesting and tasty looking items, particularly some of the artisan breads.Prices are generally on the steep side which is understandable as rents will be sky high but when spices are thirty times as expensive or more than the local Indian supermarket that is really taking the Mick! Still, some unsuspecting people must be buying at these prices.||October 4, 2016
NCdianab||50||This is a great market for fresh food, baked goods, raw foods and cooked foods. The market is under the train bridge across from Southwark Cathedral and next to London Bridge Train Station. A great place to mingle with locals. Most of the market is under a roof, so rain is not a no problem.||October 4, 2016
Michael B||50||Great atmosphere first visit biggest food market I have seen . Street food his brilliant I had a excellent hot salt beef sandwich from an outlet delicious||October 3, 2016
Foxfarlow||50||I found Borough Market by accident on our stay in London, and it turned out to be a wonderful surprise. The range and quality of food is amazing and when combined with the vibe of the place made for one of the best mornings I have experienced in years. Tastings are made available by majority of stall holders all of whom are more than willing to show their passion for their products with you.Love it Love it Love it! Tip get their early as becomes very very busy as the day wears on.||October 3, 2016
ENPalomo||50||Borough Market is on a lot of must see lists for London so we decided to visit. It's pretty easy to get to using public transportation. Their is a lot of food vendors from here from savory to sweet. Some of the booths give out samples and we tried a lot of different food. They also have a great booth with a large collection of craft beer and another with wine. Would love to go here again and try more food!||October 3, 2016
Tessa S||50||Borough Market has numerous vendors and definitely everything you need to make an exquisite charcuterie platter. I ended up here around 4 after a day of wandering London and definitely wished I had gotten there earlier as the vendors were started to close up, though I was able to get a few items at a discount. Absolutely a must if you want to pick up some artisanal cheese, some fantastic cured meats (one vendor had beersticks, venison chorizo, wild boar) and even seafood.||October 3, 2016
Christopherjkam||50||My favorite market in London. Borough Market is really easy to get to m, just catch a tube to London bridge.The market is full of great stalls. The variety of food is vast and delicious, you can also try many different types of cheeses. I definitely recommend it for anyone in London||October 3, 2016
Cuddle_Monkey||50||Visited the market on a rainy Saturday morning - quite full but still ok. Most of the stalls are under a roof, so you should be fine in bad weather (although a couple of stalls are outside).There is a huge variety of different food and drink stalls which makes this market a great choice for direct consumption or for take-away as well as buying a nice (foodie) present. Some artisan stalls are also present.Our favourite stalls so far: a cider stand with various ciders on tap, the Cinnamon Tree Bakery with gorgeous shortbreads and other baked treats (the shortbread owls are really special ... and very cute), and the British charcuterie Cannon & Cannon with some of the best sausages we ever tasted: try the pork, seaweed and cider or the veal, lemon and thyme.||October 3, 2016
AlexC10241||30||It's a normal market with mediocre food standards. A few items there are over priced and are not worth the price. WouldSuggest visiting other places instead ||October 3, 2016
Ben T||50||Borough Market is a little out of the way from all the typical "attractions" in the heart of the city. That doesn't make it difficult to access though as it's just a few blocks away from a tube station. I came on a Saturday morning when the market was in full swing. There were stands for literally every type of food item you could imagine. Exotic fruits and vegetables? They have them. Unique meats and cheeses? Check. There are also a ton of food vendors selling all of sorts of hot foods. Come here with an appetite. I ended up getting a cheese toastie(grilled cheese essentially) and it was mouthwatering. If I lived in London I imagine I would come to Borough Market often for both the fresh foods and the experience. Absolutely on my list again when I go back to London!||October 3, 2016
ThomasS916||40||The Borough market is one of the food markets of London, it beside ready to eat food you can get here also ingredients and other stuff. For me a visit here is on my list when going to London, although it is one of the most crowed once since it's recommended in every guide now. But still: go there for the authentic experience of street food ||October 3, 2016
merlin03||40||This is a must do - really nice market and changes throughout the week. If you know Seattle it's a little like Pikes Place market Well worth a visit ||October 2, 2016
Pauline B||50||Open every day but better Thursday to Sunday as more stalls are open. No seating so be prepared to walk and eat. Amazing variety of food and drinks to buy and eat. We went back three times and tried different things each time. Also great for buying cheese, olives, cakes etc to take home. Small tip - we purchased drinks and sat at a bar and then took our food back to our seats. They are OK with that as long as you are buying drinks from them!||October 2, 2016
ade55||30||The refurb and glass and steel additions to the market do not make up for this being something for one type of London, the affluent. Although I am sympathetic to the traders it's just not a place for anyone other than tourists. That said the eateries, bars and pubs around the market are all fine and frequented by all. It's just those olives, that cheese and bunches of kale and purple sprouting broccoli that are false. If you want the fruit and veg market go to the new Covent Garden one south of the river. Go here to see people with more money than sense but those that want their senses aroused by overpriced decanted Lidl European food merchandise. ||October 2, 2016
Hyton||50||This is a great market to wander around and to take in the stalls and smells. The atmosphere is buzzing and the foods available to sample were delectable. This is a fun place for lunch on the fly.||October 2, 2016
kubraso||50||I am definitely a bazaar person but everything there is delicious! Just go there and treat yourself! The fudge place is perfect, try the dark chocolate swirl fudge. And you can even find some sugar free treats.||October 2, 2016
MLBeddard||50||This has to be my favorite market! We stumbled across it as we were staying nearby and what a treat! It is great if you're wanting to do lunch a little differently as there are so many unique stalls such as patisseries, charcuteries and coffee, and the truffles stall is a must visit! We will definitely be returning. ||October 2, 2016
assist4tech||50||If you live food and are crazy about artesian stuff this is the place to be. Got to try various varieties of truffle here. Being market in itself is a nostalgia.. Don't miss it for any reason. ||October 1, 2016
Mazuza2||50||This is a great place to try all kinds of food, from every country you can think of. All kinds of specialty foods like breads, sausages, ice cream to soup and nuts. We had some excellent coffee, fresh ground and brewed right in front of you.My wife tried some Indian vegetarian food and I had a German Bratwurst. Its a great place to walk around in, even if you are not hungry. There are so many interesting shops and booths that it is a feast for the eyes. The market spreads all over a couple of blocks quite near to the Globe Theatre. It is well worth a visit if you are in London.||October 1, 2016
Vegan1759||50||I love this market!! Such a great range of delicious goodies. Love the fruit and veg stalls and vegan treats stalls, especially the stall that sold the linseeds flapjack, (can't remember the name of it unfortunately, but I had two bits of their flapjacks!). The bread stalls are also fab and the majority of their breads are suitable for vegans, even the flavoured ones. The caramelised onion breads looked sooooo good! A definite must if you are near by ||October 1, 2016
Ellen P||50||We came here for breakfast and ate all the way til lunch. Lots of grest things to try. Breads, fresh meats, fish, cheeses, wine, kiquors, and lots of food stalls. May go back again before our flight.||October 1, 2016
deb1232015||50||A great place to go for food of every type.On a wet Saturday the place was bustling! Temptation and samples on every corner! This is a great place for brunch lunch or just a snack and shopping for everything from flowers to fish, cheese, honey, chocolates and so much more!! ||October 1, 2016
Hoppityskip||40||Sensational stunning place so many stunning interesting stalls but sadly I wasn't able to avail myself of any shopping as I was on a mission! Fabulous place needs another visit||October 1, 2016
Sleepingbeauty||50||Fantastic place to do Christmas shopping, great place for photos, and great for taste testing. Lots of wonderful food to buy and eat but unfortunately not many places to sit and eat, so had to stand or go to a cafe but food not as good as what was on offer at market stalls.||October 1, 2016
LiM487||50||Right beside the London Bridge station,super convenient to access. There is a huge variety of food here and it's really a different side of London to see! Foodies would love this place. ||October 1, 2016
oneofftraveler||50||The market is a great place to have lunch! There is a big choice of street food: paella, salt beef, burgers, Ethiopian, Chinese, etc. If you an oyster lover, you should definitely check Richard Haward's Oysters bar on Stoney street! The wild rock oysters are always fresh, and you can choose from small, medium and large (they are massive!) or go for one of the oysters deals with wine or prosecco.||October 1, 2016
2WorldGypsies||50||Borough Market is for anyone who passionately loves, enjoys, wants to enjoy or learn about: Speciality Foods, common food made special, meats, fish, cheeses, sausages, breads, wine, beer, ciders, refreshing fresh juices, amazing array of mushrooms and unique beautiful garden fresh produce, jams, jellies, herbs, spices and flowers; while experiencing lovely and fun loving vendors in a busy and high energy environment.

This is not to be missed by anyone from anywhere…Thank you London!||October 1, 2016
happygirlsmommy||50||My family (husband and daughters, 9 and 3) loved this market. The food is something special, almost beautiful! Since we've been to London a few times and bought the usual mugs and tshirts for souvenirs, we now buy meats, cheeses, teas, sweets, and a delicious hazelnut spread to take back to the states for souvenirs. Places like this are rare at home, so this is a real treat! It's also one of the more affordable ways to grab a reasonably priced, delicious meal in London. ||September 30, 2016
375jillb||50||Had lunch at borough market, there is so much to choose from, we had Ethiopian was so tasty, there are different tastes from over the world, there are cake & biscuit stall olives, chocolate to many to mention||September 30, 2016
sgm88||50||If you're traveling to London you must see Borough Market! And make sure you go there hungry because there are so many different types of foods and cuisines to try. You will leave there very full and with lots of goodies! Must try Lail Live and Kappacasein.||September 30, 2016
JH72||40||Grab some nice food here. 5 min walk from London Bridge station. Many films have been shot here including Bridget Jones. The pub where they drank in is also here but I'll let you find it yourself on your search ||September 29, 2016
moviegal226||50||Notice foodie tourists: this is THE place you want to be when in London. Not only is this the best market in the city, it's one of my favorite markets in the entire world! Whenever I arrive in the U.K. I make a beeline for Borough Market.The market is sprawling yet easily manageable. I've been known to spend anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours here. Sometimes I'll even go back multiple times during my trip because there's always something new to see, explore and discover. Not for the faint of heart, especially on the crowded weekends: get ready to be packed in like a sardine in a sea of wall-to-wall shoppers.You'll find just about anything you'd want to eat here: sausages, traditional kidney pie, local oysters, champagne, jellied eels, homemade crackers, gourmet coffee, vegetarian goodies, full vegan dinners, ethnic meats, fish & chips, Irish stew, and lots of delicious sweets from local pastry shops. The vendors change often so you never know what you'll find in the main part of the market. Along the alleyways are permanent business stalls. Don't miss them!If you are lucky enough to go during the holidays, some vendors have special holiday cakes, sweets and hot buttered rum! My favorite item at the market is and always will be the vanilla donuts from Bread Ahead. Their booth moves around and never seems to be in the same location so if you find them, buy and eat a donut for me.||September 29, 2016
Margaret P||40||we walked over tower bridge and over to Borough Market. Arrived at lunch time. Mayhem. Lines long for food and to crowded to see stalls. Go on off peak times!||September 29, 2016
JacqueJames999||40||Staffs in the hotel showed us how to get, it was a great place you should not miss in the trip in London. You could find many thing for your needs and souvenir. It was interesting market.||September 28, 2016
TomScr||50||In Borough Market you can nearly get everything you want. You have soo much choice and the it smells really great. Definitely a place to go.||September 28, 2016
KatieD2710||40||Foodies will love this market. If you go at the weekend be prepared for queues, but everything smells so good! There is a lovely selection of fresh, luxury and cooked foods. There is also a small section of craft items. My friends and I enjoyed wandering down the little lanes of the market, taking in the goods on offer and the atmosphere. You could spend a hour here and see what you need to see or you could spend the day trialling the foods and drink (there was a pub just at the end of the fresh fruit which provided your drink in plastic glasses so you could stand outside looking into the market and sip your drink).We got the tube to London Bridge station and the market was outside the exit we came out but be advised there are several ways to exit the tube station!!||September 28, 2016
tomers75||50||Very nice market. Such a lovely smells, colourful place with many kinds of food. Good place to get your meal or just come and express the english spirit.||September 28, 2016
kholoud_hafez||50||The Borough market is a must, especially if you are a food lover. Fresh food, street food, fast food, snacks, you can literally find everything over there. Traditional food from many countries and food samples.The atmosphere is so vibrant, I just enjoyed drinking my orange juice, walking around the market. I got chocolates, coffee and granola as well as a Moka Pot in a shop just around the corner. ||September 28, 2016
JoeFeeds||40||I was told by multiple people to come to Borough Market, I am really glad I did. My mates and I had lunch here as we looked around. The stools sell food from all corners of the world and they look delicious. The sweet stools looked awesome we had some amazingly tasty cakes. From what I understand the fruit and veg is expensive, but the seafood shops and butchers produce looked top notch. ||September 28, 2016
Kari D||50||On my way to the train station I stumbled across this market right before you cross the bridge in Southwark. Wow! Firstly, it's beautiful. Indoor/outdoors spaces with plants, seating and free wifi. The main attraction is definitely the amazing variety of vendors. Cheese, meats, bakeries, juices, beverages, delicatessens, and flavours from around the world. I was craving breakfast so stopped off at Roast for a tasty egg and bacon butty (3.5 pounds) then to Olivier's for a fantastic almond croissant and finally had to stop at Whirld for a piece of fudge (lovely man let me sample a few before deciding). It's definitely busy but still enough room to saunter around. And best of all many of the vendors have samples! What a great place to stumble upon. Definitely recommend coming here on an empty stomach. ||September 28, 2016
bobbin08||50||I did a walking food tour with my aunt at the markets and it's was amazing! I thought it was a bit pricey but afterwards, it was worth every penny. I had a chance to taste the best food there is at the markets accompanied with infos about history, trivias and bit of alcohol of course! Our guide Raj was a top lad as well, very entertaining and informative! ||September 27, 2016
Lynne P||50||Rather than the fast food of Camden market, Borough has a more upmarket choice of dishes and has some fantastic treats as you walk around. Definitely worth a visit||September 27, 2016
bhung98||50||Went there a few times, always like to walk around and try different food, buy different things; so far I love their oysters, so fresh, so delicious and not expensive... The new discovery today is curry... If this is your first time, please make sure you try out the oysters||September 27, 2016
Torterry C||50||My partner and I was going around this area, try to get to Tower Bridge, but before reaching there, we would like to just wander around, somehow we managed to find Borough Market. Well, actually that was quite easy, we just walked out the underground station London Bridge and followed bridge close to the station, here we were. It was quite easy to recognized this place. the entrance close to the bridge was quite greenhouse looking, don't get me wrong, I really like it. Especially when the light go thought the glass passed the plants inside, this place just looked magical. I found Borough Market was like a big open supermarket, lots of different stand selling nice food. it remind me of the Great Market Hall in Budapest, full of various choices of every food. I also saw some local food stand, the people could just buy cooked food directly from them and wow, they smelt great. I would of tried out the food here, if I didn't have plan later and I just ate before I got here. Pity. People were really friendly here as well. It was quit fun to walk around. I did saw interesting local food, better try them out next time.||September 27, 2016
hakismslsk||50||I am in love with this place, I would love to eat here every day. Some shops are incredible, food is soooo delicious and the the atmosphere is so vibrant.||September 27, 2016
WalkerParty||50||This was my first visit to Borough Market - although it's a bit trendy, I really enjoyed it. Being a saturday with beautiful weather I could hardly move through the food take-away stalls. Unfortunately I was unable to sample the food as I had a prior restaurant booking but most of the food looked and smelled delicious. I was amazed by the range of fresh vegetables available with so many mushrooms I'd never seen in my life. I shall be revisiting but not on a weekend. There were doughnuts with custard cream oozing out of them which looked so tempting. I bought some lovely bread and free range eggs. The market is very easy to find, so close to London Bridge tube.||September 27, 2016
shals88||40||An all week food market, with an amazing blend of cuisine form around the world. My favourite is the koshari food stall along with the yummy chocolate macroons in one of the pastry stalls at Borough market.||September 27, 2016
744frankz||50||Very special covered marker wehere you can eat very wel,also lots of biological food. We ate the biological goat kofte with great salad. You must see this and taste the very good food!||September 27, 2016
Theblondeneedle||50||We went on a Monday when most shops were closed, and didn't feel like we missed anything! We sampled Scottish boar and venison, fresh gnocchi, juices, veggies, any cheese you can imagine, breads/olive oils & grabbed Monmouth coffee from across the street. ||September 26, 2016
MartySFCA||50||Of several indoor/outdoor markets we visited recently in London, Borough Market was by far the best. Both inside and outside, the food stands offered a great variety of high quality fresh and prepared foods, ranging from fresh fish, poultry, meat and vegetables, to fine sausages and cheeses, savory and dessert pies, Scotch eggs,Turkish sweets, Indian curries, interesting wines and beers, and strong coffees and teas. We visited Borough Market twice, once on a crowded Sunday morning and then on a quiet weekday afternoon, and enjoyed the different experiences both days. The location adds to the fun, on the south bank of the Thames near Southwark Cathedral and London Bridge and with train lines running overhead.||September 26, 2016
Andrea R||40||The market is close to the tower of London. All of a sudden you're immersed in a Asian like market full of every kind of food. Really interesting.||September 26, 2016
Sophie M||50||My First ever visit, coming from a market town I was expecting just a normal food market. I couldn't of been more wrong! As soon as you start walking around all your senses come alive there are so many different things to look at and to try, you automatically want to make sure you look at every inch in case you miss something. The different types of food available to you lets you experience all sorts of cultures and you really get to appreciate all the different crafts that have gone into the making of the food. A must see! I will definitely be going back as it is an experience you don't want to have just once.||September 26, 2016
TeamNorbuling||40||We just found this place by chance as we were walking around that area.We loved what we found there esp the eatery was great! All kinds of stalls we saw and i think we had one of the best pork roast in one of the stalls!!!Interesting place for sure.||September 26, 2016
ravster43||50||You can spend the whole day at Borough Market.When i lived in London, all my shopping was from there!All in all, its a fantastic market! A bit pricey, but you pay for quality!||September 25, 2016
Sandy5432||50||Unbelievable food market! Grocery shop or just go to eat...and eat ... and EAT!! Something for everyone from truffles to olives to cheese to pasta and paella. Grilled corn on the cob and tons of pasties and breads. This is just a sampling of the offerings. Definitely make a stop here on your London adventure.||September 25, 2016
Roger61Texas||40||Great market. Great selection of vendors. Amazing fish veggies, pies, fish etc. Well worth a stop in. Come hungry and give yourself a few hours to browse and eat your way through!!||September 25, 2016
sebaytravel||50||Amazing food market, you can find all types of cooked food and fruits.If you go to one market in London it's this one||September 25, 2016
StepheyTSC||40||Went on a Monday morning, unfortunately not all stores were opened. There was a wide selection of types of food and drinks stalls and shops selling quaint teas to spices. Monmouth coffee is very nearby with a queue. Tried a pulled beef sandwich and it's very good. £6 for a big one. ||September 25, 2016
pebble82||40||We love visiting food markets so we popped in London Borough Market on a Thursday afternoon upon reaching London. Although it was after 1.00 pm, the place was still buzzing being a full market day. We walked around the main hall and stopped to try some French cheese offered for free tasting. It was delicious and before we left the market, we went in search of the stall to buy some.There were lots of stalls selling fresh produce as well as stands offering cooked food for a quick bite and they were popular with the crowd. We saw a stall offering a great variety of mushrooms, some of which we had never seen. The fish stall had many different types of seafood. My husband could not resist buying a tub of cooked whelks. The vendor of Furness Food Hut was cooking venison steak burgers, chicken tikka wrap and wild boar hot dogs. He was urging people to try samples of the various cooked meats, a great way to entice customers. We enjoyed the tasting and bought a venison steak burger, a little pricey at £7.00 but juicy and tasty. At the green market behind the main hall, were rows of ethnic street food on offer and these also attracted a queue.We thoroughly enjoyed walking around the market and highly recommend a visit if you are in this area of London near London Bridge tube station.||September 25, 2016
Katinka E||40||This marked is exiting with smells from all over the world. A bit crowded and long ques, but the food is worth it.||September 25, 2016
foodiedwkp||50||We have been here several times now and every time discover a new interesting food. Borough market has a superb spice stall with everything you could wish for including fruit powders which are incredible. The bread ahead doughnuts are delicious and I love the multiple juice bars dotted around. It is spread out over a wide area so you don't feel claustrophobic as there are a lot of people there! A must destination for any foodie! ||September 25, 2016
melharah||50||Came across this market by accident as we were making our way to the London bridge. And boy, was I glad we found this place!The food smelled and looked amazing! It was a great place for us to eat lunch and try some amazing seafood and sample really good truffle oil and balsamic vinegar. A must-see! I am definitely coming back.||September 25, 2016
Zoe0805||40||Real foodie place to visit, lovely things to buy and experience. Go early because by lunchtime the place was heaving! Sadly a very touristy place with high prices but still worth a visit ||September 24, 2016

Bluebellknoll000||50||A nice little market with food produce - cheeses, oils,crepes, Thai food extra. There are plenty of chances to have little tasters. Fruit and veg seems pretty reasonable. Well worth a visit. ||September 24, 2016

paulak669||50||We went to the Borough Market not expecting much, and it was fantastic! The food options are many and really good! I had chicken dumplings and a duck wrap at L'ail Olive, and my boyfriend a typical Ethiopian dish at another place. All tasted original and very good :)||September 23, 2016
ykhabal||40||One of my favourite places to go in London. Very close to London Bridge station so it's easy to get to. There is so much to eat here . They offer huge selection of sweet and savoury things. There are always little bites to try for free too. You can find delicious pastries and bread or hot meals for the many stalls. Lots of vegetarian things to eat too. You have to try some of the desserts. Amazing brownies and donuts. They also have an amazing shop that sells all kind of olive oil which u can try before u buy. You also find Lovely little coffee shops like Monmouth coffee shop which is always busy but serves excellent coffee. The market is very busy on Saturday but it's nice to walk around on a sunny day. ||September 23, 2016
russgiggsy||50||We visited with the kids and tied it in with lunch time. Great goods of all kinds to choose from. Would be great if we were self catering so that we could by so.e more produce. ||September 23, 2016

619stanleys||50||We visited the market on Saturday around 1 pm. This place was packed with people when we got there and there were tons of people coming in as we were there. There are lot of food vendors selling their specialy gourmet food. We had a Boston double burger for lunch which is a big bun with pork patties. Very tasty. We also ordered a roast pulled pork sandwich from a different vendor. Very delicious, The roasted pork skin is very crispy. We also had a croissant and Italian cheese stick. Also very good. There is a variety of vendors that sell cheese, wine, juice, sausages and processed meat, and seafood, etc. A very interesting market place to visit in London.||September 22, 2016
Gbtraveler2||40||Stopped by the market and ended up grabbing a quick dinner with the family at a vender set up outside. ||September 22, 2016
Grant D||50||Visited for the first time and was not disappointed! Different food stalls around every corner all serving great value(For London) food and drink. Will definitely be back!||September 22, 2016
Beachlover1989||50||This place isn't open every day, because we tried to go one day with no luck. It is so amazing to walk through here and have so many organic options available! There are so many home made things here to buy and eat! I could spend an entire day here and love every minute of it. Fruits, vegetables, meats, seafood, salts, pastries, and I could go on and on. If you're in London, you have to visit this amazing market!||September 21, 2016
treemad||40||Lovely lunch, light and airy with covered out side area too. Modern feel in an old market and with good quality food. ||September 21, 2016
jod694||50||A must do in London is a visit to the fabulous Borough Markets. Open every day here you will find an amazing selection of food!! Great for a lunch stop or to try the never ending samples of cheeses, olives, fruit and breads etc!! Short walk from London Bridge Tube Station!!||September 21, 2016
b00sun||40||Visited on a Monday so not busiest day but goodness you can get some amazing food there! Go hungry, that's my advice !||September 21, 2016
Andycor1||50||Borough market is the place to go if you worship food. Such a magnificent selection of foods from all corners of the globe. If you like cheese there are so many to choose from and most of the stalls give out free tasters. We bought two lumps and then sat in pub with some wine a Guinness and devoured both of them. The hot cider and the goat kebabs are worth a try. ||September 21, 2016
Baby-Babble||50||what a wonder market, like being in a totally foreign country - well,... various foreign countries all at once with fabulous display of yummie foods. we had an excellent time and will no doubt be back one day with a huge empty shopping bag!||September 21, 2016
SillyShake||50||Oh wow what a treat this place is! I could easily have spent all day here even though it was a 'limited market' day. There was lots to sample (and then buy!) and I found the prices reasonable. I was disappointed that my lunch choice was so big as I would have liked to try more food! I left with bread, cheeses, cured meat, truffle oil and truffle spread, Turkish delight and also gifts for friends. Stall holders were very friendly and very keen to share the stories of their wares. Well worth a visit or three!||September 21, 2016
o_ciit||50||An incredible experience between stands of food coming from all parts of the world...but Italian food seems to be the most appreciated.Crowded place but very unique and full of aromas. Is worth a visit ... may be two!||September 20, 2016
elsflpbnncs||50||This place is amazing, and i didn't even go in the good day! Fresh produce, cheeses, spices, food everywhere. I hear (too late unfortunately to try) that the doughnut from bread ahead is the 2nd best in the world! And it is huge! ||September 20, 2016
bridgetcerny||50||This is such a wonderful market. We checked before going to make sure it was open and went on a Thursday - I don't believe it's open every day. Very interesting stalls and an amazing place to take photographs. Lots of different types of food and small eating places. Bought some gifts to take home. We ended up having lunch where we could sit as not all of them have a place to sit and eat. It was crowed but we could still get around easily. Great atmosphere and easy to get to on the underground.||September 20, 2016
MostPerfectParadox||50||Boyfriend and I for a casual perusal on Saturday morning. Enjoyed a mega breakfast of bacon, bubble and cheese in bap, and then spent time nibbling here and there, being amused by the amazing range and quality of stalls. A few gifts bought - mainly for myself - and escaped as it started to get a bit busy around mid day. My foodie imagination has been reignited- and bf is prepared for this to become a shopping destination for ingredients as long as we can buy something from Drunk Cheese...||September 20, 2016
giuspesch||40||There's basically anything. You'll find raw, fresh products as well as burgers, sandwiches, pastries and much more. Good quality of the food, at fair prices.||September 20, 2016
Luv2Travel6||40||We studied up on the Borough Market and made sure all of the vendors that we wanted to see would be open at lunchtime on a Monday (our only opportunity to go). Sadly we did not realize that the Monday we were there was a bank holiday and thus the market was shut down. We were so disappointed to see all of the closed stalls. Guess it's all the more reason to come back to London :)||September 19, 2016
Disbenmed||50||Went on a Friday and had to go back Saturday which should sum up pretty well how we got on. Loads of food stalls, took the easy way out and went for the busiest stalls to be sure of satisfaction and yes the wait in good company was wortwhile. The gentleman at the reception desk was very helpful, and overall I really appreciated the lack of hard sell, yes there were some shouts of what was on offer but never in an invasive way, if you liked it you bought it.||September 19, 2016
Ruedi55||40||The market has an excellent choice for fresh food and also wine. Even to visit when it's raining, there is a roof. Pubs and Restaurants around. Nice corners/shops to drink a glass of white wine and "look around", to forget the time.||September 19, 2016
ScottF108||50||An awesome variety of food stalls. This is only a food market, so you wont find any of the cheap garbage and nick-nacks you find at other markets.Great atmosphere and free samples everywhere you look! Check it out||September 19, 2016
rogertaboyle||50||On a weekend trip we stopped at borough market for a bite to eat.A huge selection of delicious looking food.Unfortunately because of the rain ALL of London was there too.I'll be back when it is less crowded||September 19, 2016
AndyB3111||50||Great way to eat a cheap lunch. Borough market is a mix of street food outlets and professional traders (butchers, bakers, fishmongers, grocers et al) with some genuinely interesting food outlets I really enjoy this place, only wish it was nearer to home. Highlight for me is Brindisa - 3 Iberico hams being hand cut.||September 19, 2016
totocookingclasses||40||The place is so lively and busy with people - I love it. With more than 100 over food stores selling fresh food such as bread, pastry, meat and more, I feel like I could just spend the whole day exploring the area while having occasional snack stops with some friends. It is incomparable to any other regular supermarket that is available elsewhere. It is such a pity, I did not allocate much time here. But I will be back. One thing to note for first timers - Not all the stores are open everyday. Lesser stores are open on Monday & Tuesday. So it is better to plan your visit from Wednesday onwards. ||September 18, 2016
Lyn S||30||Food is very expensive and we found a couple of the stalls set up with food but no one wanted to serve us, perhaps we were too early.there is no where to sit to eat food. The fresh oysters were delicious and the market is worth a visit If you like oysters||September 18, 2016
thesportsmom||50||Our hotel concierge suggested we stop at the Borough Market for lunch! There are a large number of food stands selling everything from Soul Food to Salads to Ice Cream! Everything is made on site and we were thrilled with the atmosphere! This was a great find! The prices were right, the food was good, and it was an experience unto itself!||September 18, 2016
Peter T||40||Much smaller version of St Josep market in Barcelona. Interesting to look around and grab some food but a little on the expensive side.||September 18, 2016
DaanvdB||40||We went to the Borough Market on a saturday and boy was it crowded. The atmosphere was great though. After a walk around the different market stalls we decided to take a burger from Furnuss Food Hut. A great decision! We topped it off with a bottle of cold pale ale from a couple of stalls next to it and took some time to discover the market some more.||September 18, 2016
Beatrice-TA||50||Each year the market seems to get bigger and busier. There are lots more stalls where the food is cooked there and then. All food is very fresh and top quality with masses of choice. Lunch times are extremely busy with long queues if you go about 2.00pm the crowds have died down a bit. Saturdays are the busiest and you have to move with the crowd at a snails pace. It is closed on a Sunday. Some good pubs in the vicinity nearest tube London bridge.||September 18, 2016
awhiting1||50||I love borough market. Not only the amazing produce on offer but also the surroundings. Really stunning. The produce is what it's known for. The fruit and vegetables are incredible. Lots of samples on offer as well. Take plenty of cash.||September 18, 2016
chrispytew||50||We came across this by mistake Make sure you're hungry as it would be a shame to miss out on the fantastic selection of foods from around the world ||September 18, 2016
Nathan F||50||Borough market is a foodie's heaven. On the plus side, a great selection of ingredients and food to eat while you're there, but there are downsides. You will certainly not be alone, the crowds are getting bigger by the year and in some parts of the market it can be almost impossible to move at peak times. The prices, like the queues, are also rising dramatically. You will see a huge range of food and drinks, but don't expect a bargain. Make sure you go to all three sections of the market and don't forget there are also shops and pubs in the surrounding streets to see - a German Deli, Neil's Yard Dairy for great cheese, The Rake for great ale. Having lived locally for nearly ten years I have seen the transformation of Borough market from a run down market to one of the top destinations in London for tourists and locals. If the crowds and prices increase by much more it might loose its charm, but in the meantime take plenty of cash and a big bag because you'll want to take plenty of the mushroom pate, burrata or truffles home with you.||September 17, 2016
charlie1509||50||Been to this market every time we visit London - and it never disappoints. We always find something new and delicious to try, with more and more businesses bringing their stalls here. It's pretty much all food; we normally sample different foods from different stalls and share, as we're not satisfied with just one! Everyone is very friendly too - just take an umbrella if it's raining as you don't want to miss out on the outside parts. ||September 17, 2016
ktrim||50||Fabulous market, well worth a visit.Huge variety of food to suit all tastes. Try a mixed Fish Wrap from Applebee's, fantastic taste & value. ||September 17, 2016
flirtygerty76||50||Lovely place really suprised at how much lovely stuff there was, really worth a stroll around and maybe a spot of lunch..would be hard to resist! We walked across london bridge from the monument, wandered around the market and then up the road to the globe theatre. ||September 17, 2016
TravelD1174||40||I have been here a few times and there is no doubting that this place has a good atmosphere and a good variety of foods, but be prepared to take a lot of money if you want a proper shop here. No surprise that it is expensive because of it's location. If your looking for good food to buy and a good atmosphere then I would recommend this market.||September 17, 2016
403kristynav||50||This place is full of nice smells cute little place, fresh fruit, fresh bakery, meat, cheese... All if that. You can get great coffee. You can taste the world and take some home with you. ||September 17, 2016
karenm442||50||This is a wonderful place to meander and the market is always packed. It's only food and drink but these are the creme de la creme. From wheels of cheese and assorted wine to paella and breads. We always make a bee line for Maria's Cafe where the sausage and bubble and squeak bun is 10/10. ||September 17, 2016
Robert M||50||Went to the Borough Market in London on a quick tour of the city. Stopped at the third stall in and had a wonderful salted meat sandwich. It was a good as any corn beef I have ever had including the one we ate at Katz's deli on the lower east side of NYC. Wife had a shredded lamb wrap. It was delicious. ||September 17, 2016
Ian M||50||A fantastic market with so much produce to see from within and outside the UK. A food lovers dream, various fruits, vegetables, cheeses, fish and alcohol, some rarely seen in other markets. As you walk around you can sample some of the products. A great way to spend a few hours.||September 17, 2016
Ashley S||40||We wouldn't be called Great Britain if we didn't love our multi cultural cuisine.Head down to Borough market to sample some of the tastiest food samples from all over the globe (mainly Europe)The food stalls are of a high quality, with the stall holders general good send of attitude and knowledgeable palette.Would highly recommend, only downside is that it can get extremely busy as it has very limited space.||September 17, 2016
Chloe_foodlover||50||Great market full of wonderful treasures and history. Lots of different bread, cheese, vegetables, fruits, alcohol, crafts from all over the world ||September 16, 2016
Michael L||50||I wasn't too excited to go, but my wife insisted. Am I glad she did. The aromas, the amazing food, flowers and other things to experience are dizzying. Cheese and specialty meat vendors from several countries. Food to eat there and to take home. Samples galore. Great place to visit. ||September 16, 2016
craigmcarthur||50||We passed through Borough Food Market and sampled a few of the dozens of excellent food vendors offering hot, fresh food. The atmosphere was great and the selection of food stuffs excellent. Well worth a stroll if in the area.||September 16, 2016
pedidoctx||50||We traveled from Old Street a couple pf stops on the Northern (black line) of the tube, in London Bridge station and it is steps away.We were on a quest for Chipotle and Guajillo chile and alas, we found what we were looking for. It is a laid back ambiance, with food items and vendors from around the world and cuisine to match.Can not think where to eat ?Try the market, it will for sure not disappoint you!||September 16, 2016
Liisi E||50||Fantastic market. There were so many different choices in different categorys. Crowded but so intresting place. So many interesting people. Fresh food, cooked food, pastries, cheese, wines, u name it, its there!||September 16, 2016
I8108JYcraigb||50||The Borough Market should be a must on your list when visiting London if you love food. The atmosphere and diverse range of food and beverages on offer is amazing. The generosity of the merchants in sampling their wares is terrific and enables one to make an informed decision about what to purchase. We started our oddessey with a coffee from the renowned Monmouth Coffee House across the road, which was excellent. Back at the markets we sampled and subsequently purchased a divine Iberico Jamon from the Spanish outlet, Brindisa, having tried all 3 varieties on offer.Next stop was for oysters and prosecco. ..4 magnificent wild oysters with a glass of prosecco for 10 pounds. The oysters were superb.We split then, with my choice being traditional fish and chips while my wife chose a salt beef sandwich with mustard and pickle . The hake and chips were cooked to perfection and great value at 9 pounds. The sandwich was also excellent.In summing up, you are better off eating here than in a mediocre restaurant (of which there are many in Central London) because you will have much better food at less than half the cost.||September 16, 2016
aplacetocrash||50||A fantastic market. Reminded me of a farmer's market. The cheese stalls are a must. Lots of tastings!||September 15, 2016
randie c||50||A ton of food, people, samples of food. Fresh fruit fish veggies. Cooked everything, dessrts. Crowded but doable. ||September 15, 2016
The_Siads_on_holiday||40||We reached the market at about 1pm and was welcomed by the smell of all the food being prepared.. It was a lovely afternoon out but it was extremely busy. We had a buggy with us and it proved quite difficult to get through some places. The food available is delicious! I would definetly go again but preferably a weekday when it would be less busy to enjoy it more..||September 15, 2016
Caroline R||50||Our first visit to this market but probably not the last. There is loads to see and buy.Some beautifully arranged stalls attracted customers and photographers equally!  Fruit, vegetable, cheeses, butchery, charcuterie plus cafés, street food, vegan, vegetarian food stalls. ||September 15, 2016
Anne F||50||Visited last Saturday. It is just around the corner from London Bridge tube station.Large variety of stalls, most of which provide tasters. It does get very busy so if you don't like crowded places, this might not be the place for you!Highly recommend going to Spice Mountain, lots of interesting and unusual spices I have never seen before and the prices were very good.Although most of the market is undercover, there is quite a bit which isn't (it seemed to be the bit doing most of the street food) - so be warned when it is raining!Also the only seating available is in the kitchen demo section, but there is really not a lot of it.All in all though would definitely recommend visiting!||September 15, 2016
Kidjadontja||50||Lots of little booths set up to try out new and exciting foods. My favorite is the mushroom pate and the exotic meats (ostrich, zebra and gator). Can be overwhelmingly crowded though so watch out!@||September 14, 2016
nanaxs6||50||Do not pass up an opportunity to experience this market! It is beyond fabulous ! The fresh produce, meats ,cheeses olives are to die for! By far the best crock olives I have ever tasted! We had lunch there several times, each time we tried something different! Thai, Bratwurst and panini 5 cheese grilled sandwich were our favorites!Take your food to the bar area, get a Sangaria you won't be disappointed, plus you can enjoy your food at a bistro table, relax and just watch the interesting people!Don't go to London without going to this market! Great location between both bridges. We actually walked from the London bridge along the river bank to the Tower bridge, a lovely walking path, about 4 miles total.||September 14, 2016
Sandygranny||50||We visited this lovely market again while in London and sampled a wide selection of freebie tasters on offer.The market was extremely busy when we visited and it took a long time for us to get around it.Once again, we bought some lovely fresh bread from the baker’s stall to take home and some cheese and fruit from two of the other stalls.||September 14, 2016
788debrac||50||Love this market. What a historical gem. The market has been used in some form for around 1000 years. Many food stalls. Anything you could possibly be hungry for. We ate several things & everything was delicious especially the donuts at the bread bakery. The vanilla & chocolate are amazing. There are fresh food stalls, seafood, cheese, oils, wine, cocktails, ales, hot food , sandwiches etc etc. A foodie paradise. Enjoy. Near London bridge. ||September 14, 2016
tembo||50||We wandered round the market enjoying the free tastes on offer - cheese, bread, oils, sweet things. There is SO much choice it is difficult to choose what to buy. If you love food then this place is definitely worth a visit.||September 14, 2016
863garym||50||What a great place. Wonder round, so much to see. Fresh produce on every corner. Lovely food to try. Buzzing with excitement. A great event for all the family.||September 14, 2016
Shailendra H||50||In the middle of city of London next to London Bridge underground station you will find a unique open air market serving food from all corners of the world. Find budding entrepreneurs wanna be chefs try and entice you to sample their offerings. Fresh produce, meat and fish are also on offer for that perfect meal you will want to cook yourself. Priced just right for a quick bite on the go or enjoy one now the sit in restaurants. London famous fish and chips as well as other local delicacies xan be found here.||September 14, 2016
magdalenao521||50||I went just to have look for some spices but I ended up buying lots of fruit and fresh vegetables. Delicious fresh produce and excellent food. I recommend the Croatian stall and vegetarian Indian stall with samosas. I will definitely be back to sample some more. ||September 14, 2016
turimartinez||50||Been 2 or 3 times alone (sadly I discovered when was about to leave England) the food is great including the Argentinian food place! The place is beautiful and has really nice vibes! If you are going to London bridge, or close to it, go and check it out! ||September 14, 2016
Y5765QTcraigh||50||We was glad to have visit Borough Market. The Borough Markets is truly an experience for a food lover or indulger. I was happy to have found the legendary toasted cheese sandwich yummy!! Come with an empty stomach this place is a MUST GO!||September 13, 2016
kappy26||50||A really old food market near London Bridge. It has foods from many places all over the world. Do go there if in London.||September 13, 2016
artwithoutboundaries||50||I'm not a Foodie but I found this place is great to drink, eat and shop fresh/ organic food. Easy to go and find it, just next to London Bridge Tube. I couldn't resist to buy a fresh fish & shrimp wrap. Taste so good. Suggest to visit this market if you plan to go to Tate Modern or Shakespeare's Globe as well. You could spend a whole day there.||September 13, 2016
Somnuvanitas||50||The most joyful experience for the palate - the Louvre of the taste - lively, warm , cosy....life passes by so quickly.....in this spot you have time to grab the most meaningful side of it. You get allucination for the 1000 smells embrace your nose. Togetherness through the food! ||September 13, 2016
Lorraine P||50||market type stalls selling everything your heart desires, too hard to choose just one to eat. Chocolate, cheeses, spices and much much more. Paella, curry, scotch eggs, salt beef bagels etc etc.||September 13, 2016
Jellybellydancer||40||If you enjoy food then you will enjoy Borough Market. There is a selection of both independent suppliers of fresh food with choices that you won't find in most supermarkets, and artisan food stalls, many offering samples and great for lunch or a snack.Over the years, the emphasis has definitely shifted more in favour of street food with anything from wraps and toasted cheese, through salt beef and duck confit sandwiches to noodles and curries. Vegetarian, vegan, gluten free and diary free are all catered for in some capacity.In addition to plenty of cheese, salami, pate and chutney samples, on my most recent visit I enjoyed a delicious cheese and olive stick from Bread Ahead, stuffed full of chunky pieces of olive and topped with glorious melted cheese. A thick, gooey, chewy brownie from Oliver's Bakery was the perfect desert.I also could resist a scotch egg from Scotchtails to save for later.There is still a good choice of fruit and veg stalls, butchers and fishmongers for locals, but there is a definite touristy vibe too. I suppose this is only to be expected once the word got out, but I do hope this doesn't ultimately compromise it's integrity.||September 13, 2016
150oktayk||30||It was not as big as i expected. Anyhow quite incredible . Come here from london bridge tube not borough. ||September 13, 2016
BA_Lars||50||This place is amazing! One of the oldest food markets in London and definitely worth a visit, particularly if you're a hungry foodie. Lots of stalls selling prepared food, but there's a definite lack of tables or places to sit and eat. Next time I go, my plan will be to do my shopping, pick up my hot food items and then make the short walk to the south bank of the Thames to find a place to eat and enjoy the view.||September 12, 2016
Artistaero||50||A great place to wander around, drink a pint, try a variety of foods and finish with any of an array of desserts. I opted for goat milk ice cream which, while small, was quite delicious.||September 12, 2016
mastbash||30||I remember how thrilled I was on my first visit to Borough Market. On that day I found a vibrant food market with every type of fresh food. It seemed to me it was a cooks paradise!What a disappointment today's visit was. So much of the space that was taken up by fresh food has been replaced with offers of cooked foods. The fresh foods created a unique urban market. Now it's mostly just another place for a curry or a chip shop! It to expensive there now for the original concept to survive. You can't stop change but I'm sad nonetheless.If you go stick to the weekends!||September 12, 2016
MY1234||40||First visited in Winter 2013. This time round, there were more stalls, better directory and a cooking demonstration too. The variety of cheeses, tomatoes, fruits and mushrooms were amazing. Had a great variety of Oysters too this time. Will definitely visit again if I have time in London.||September 12, 2016
GolfNut20002013||50||Second time at Borough Market last week. I just wished I lived closer. Such a selection of every type of meat, cheese and veg from independent suppliers. Things from around the world that are hard to find. Also great food stalls selling food from around the world. You just want to buy and eat everything. British charcuterie and cheeses along with wine merchant/bistro are my highlights. I just can't wait to go back.||September 12, 2016
isabel p||50||if you are a foodlover like me you will be in heaven - so much choices and so much to eat and look at - be adventurous and try something new + different||September 11, 2016
cricri0092017||30||I went there quite early and most of the stales were closed.So i had to wait , and have breakfast at the rather expensive and too posh roast restaurent , which is overlooking the market.My First impression was that the market was not very traditionnal , and was rather trendy and touristy. With lots of "cool " stalls, offering trendy food . The kind of food you see bloggers bragging about on instagram....So the market doesn't have the authentic feel to me.I thought the food was good, not exceptionnal but expensive.So, nothing to brag home about.I Had the salted caramel filled donought , and some focaccia bread from a stall, right at the middle of entry of the market. Foccacia was dry , but the donought excellent.plus, some cumberland saussage sandwich ,from a guy located at the other side of the market. Also good .I recommend the place if you're visiting the area , to see the shard ; or go to the tate museum.It's a good spot for a quick lunch.Otherwise it's not really worth it to cummute all the way down to that side of the river , just to visit the market.||September 11, 2016
VAP1611||50||I feel that whatever I write will fail to do justice to Borough Market -- the sights, smells and tastes were amazing.I already had the intent to visit Borough Market, but I sort of unexpectedly happened upon it after visiting Saint Paul's when I decided to cross the Millennium Bridge and wander along the Thames River. I was pleasantly startled by the smells of all sorts of foods lingering about the place -- the cheeses and fruits, coffee brewing and roasting meat topped off with the smell of freshly baking breadsI immediately bought a onion and tomato focaccia, sat on the curb and enjoyed. I pledged to myself that each day while I was in London, that I would come back to the market for lunch, and even a breakfast on a Saturday.There would be BBQ from Hobbs, a salt beef sandwich from Northfield Farms, a brat from the German Deli, and a roast hog sandwich topped off with rocket and an apple sauce. I sampled fresh lemon curd doughnuts, an Italian blue cheese, fudge, baklava, and it all was amazing. So much to sample and experience, and it was all wonderful.If you are visiting London, take a break from the museums, do yourself a favor and take the tube to London Bridge stations and visit Borough Market.||September 10, 2016
860lynnf||50||This market has everything you need. Lots of meats and cheese's. Hot food to stuff yourself with for days. I could eat here everyday. A must stop at if you have a couple hours and want to eat local and other European food.||September 10, 2016
zsszn||30||Maybe we come too soon, but there was no people in the market - then there was no market feeling without crowd. There was some stands, but not so much, and everywhere the same stuff. We buy chocolate brownies and was beautiful. But this was all. ||September 10, 2016
Tom C||50||After visiting the Shard it was a short walk to Borough Market for lunch. Hot food ranged from wraps, noodles, pies and mash, Boston sausages, hog roast and a vegetarian curry stall (see photo). Curry box cost £6.50 good value and delicious. An easy market to walk around with plenty of diverse artisan stalls.||September 10, 2016
CLhull||50||This is the best food market I have ever been. Great choice from all across the world. Veggie, seafood, meat, everything. All reasonably priced and delicious.||September 10, 2016
122KLC||40||During my last short trip to London, spent a few hours in the Borough Market where is right next to the subway; super convenient. There are stalls selling all kinds of fresh food, vegetables, fishes and cooked food. Nice place to try local food and take some pictures.There are nice restaurants apart from the food stalls, we wen to The Fish, ordered fish and chips (since we are in London), fish soup, oysters, salad and others. Food were good, fresh and good service. Strongly recommend to business travelers if you can spare 2-3 hours (get to know more of London and local style, thus you can negotiate your business deals like an expert), tourists and food lovers.||September 10, 2016
inessac1991||50||I adore this market! I am a huge market goer and this one always impresses. There are a few stands I ALWAYS buy from which include: Bread Ahead doughnuts, Borough Olives (Vollo and basil/garlic greens), a mushroom paté stand and a cheese stand right beside it with white and green packaging! The food stands offer amazing products. Most stands give out free samples which really pulls you in because the food is that good! The market is organized mostly into two main parts and is mostly covered from the rain! It seems the front half of the market is full of the vendors selling cheese, bread, sweets, meats, veggies, fruits and drinks. The back half mostly outdoors is food vendors so you can grab a meal as you walk! I've eaten at maybe 6 of the vendors so far and have never disliked a meal. They are all fantastic!Make sure you bring cash or you can expect to wait 5-10 minutes outside of the market at an ATM. The market is best on a Saturday and I believe it opens 10-5 but have found that nearing 4 some stands already are closing up! So get there early if possible because it is a fantastic time :)||September 9, 2016
RolandoAlfonso||20||Our recent trip covered several cities in Europe, we had the great experience to visit Il Mercato Centrale in Florence, and so we decided to give a try to Borough Market in London. Being one of the most important reasons to visit these Markets is to experience their culinary offers. Tha is something I will not suggest you do. You may go if you are looking to buy something to go or take home. The food experience not so good since there is NO place to sit to enjoy your meal and on top; the restaurants and bars near do not allow you to use their sitting area unless you buy from them (which is understandable)||September 8, 2016
Trinitea||40||Borough Market was a recommended place to visit by many for my first visit to London. Before going, it's best to check out which day as there are limited and full market days in the week and closed on Sunday's. I went by around noon and could not resist but to try out one of the oyster bars. Shellseeker, very fresh and sweet to the taste, think a glass of wine would have made it perfect !A great place for foodies or for those who love to try something new. Food food glorious food!||September 8, 2016
mlutke||50||Borough Marketplace is awesome! Fresh foods market & food stalls from every country! The majority of the market is closed on Sundays, so hit it Friday or Saturday for best experience!||September 8, 2016
694BenM||50||We went in the evening to enjoy an evening around the market area. It was fantastic. There's lots of street food sellers with tables and benches provided. The pubs let you take your drinks outside as well. It has a real continental feel about it. We had some fresh let cooked pizza, from a genuine pizza oven. Cost wise, a tenner for the special and it was ready in a couple minutes. We tried a few of the pubs around, which were all busy but easy to get served. If you want something a bit more formal there are lots of restaurants around, but be warned you better book, even though it was mid week, it was very busy. It's one of my favourite parts of London and well worth a visit. You wont be disappointed.||September 7, 2016
Ciaran K||50||This is a great place to grab a bite to eat and a Great market. you can even have a drink in the bar below Bridget jones flat.. definitely worth a visit when in london.||September 7, 2016
steviegs||30||With continental markets springing up everywhere, Borough market has lost it's novelty. Once a showcase for worldwide cuisine, it has now become an over-priced tourist attraction. £6 for a basic boar butty, £1.75 for a Subway sausage sandwich with all the trimmings over the road, delicious. Tried a £4 natural remedy hangover cure; still hungover.The best thing was stumbling across The Golden Hind near-by.||September 7, 2016
Sparklestarburst||40||Lots of food stalls, high quality cuisine from around the world. Very high class street foods. A focus on luxury and fairtrade, things can be a bit pricey. Sadly there were no other stalls, just food. I think it needs other stalls, souveniers and collectables and such likes.Good food market though....but camden is cheaper!||September 7, 2016
kcinvi1||40||The market and surrounding pubs and eateries were well worth the trip. Went a little late in the day so the stalls were closing up. Was able to get some fresh fruits, variety of olives, and jerky. Then got some fish and chips at a little side shop, and some ice cream from another. A very nice gentleman helped me select a nice bottle of red wine in a side store. Lots of people were hanging out at the various pubs, so sidewalks a little crowded, but good for people watching. Had a very lovely afternoon/evening.||September 7, 2016
katsyulo||50||I come here at least once a month with hubby to grab our favourite food stall Ethiopian Flavours! Never a let down to have the chicken combo with lentils and split peas. Yum yum. Hope they stay there! ||September 6, 2016
TravelmanBasingstoke||50||What an amazing place to visit. As a tourist this is a must visit destination. Borough Market is a free attraction and takes a couple of hours to wander through and adjacent areas. Borough Market is a market bit nothing like you have seen before. You have greengrocers, cheese makers, butchers, artisan bakers along with an array of food outlets from hot food ( meat/ vegetarian/ vegan/ gluten free) to cakes, juice bars, hot beverages and everything else you can think off.Borough Market is a short walk up from Tate Modern and about 10 mins from St Paul's Cathedral.||September 6, 2016
Stephanie G||50||This is a great place to wander around for an hour or two. There are tons of food options, including vegan and vegetarian. I ended up getting a meat pasty from one of the stalls and it was delicious. Sadly, I can't remember the name of the place. ||September 6, 2016
Marymamie||40||Went with my daughter and had a lovely wander and a bite to eat.Bought a few bits of spices but nothing fresh as was travelling.Lovely market lots of fresh products.||September 6, 2016
anon8882014||50||You must go to the Borough Market - and come with a big appetite. Lots of nibbles to try and more upscale street food is readily available. Not to miss.||September 6, 2016
Travelbug8796||50||We stumbled across borough market by accident when wandering.What a great place to go for drinks and food. The Saturday market was fab. No pushy sellers, just great people, lively atmosphere with amazing choices of food and drink! ||September 6, 2016
Aepplerschosch||50||Borough Market is the one place I visit every time I go to London. Great atmosphere, tons and tons of fantastic foods from all around the world. If possible I come here twice while in town as there are just too many delicious things to try (salted beef sandwich, Scottish eggs, etc.).||September 6, 2016
D8669VBlauram||50||Borough Market is a must see and must eat experience. Our family of four (two adults and two teens) look forward to visiting Borough Market. It is one of those places when you are back home that you will catch yourself daydreaming and thinking about. Great food options (you must pace yourself) and fabulous people watching. An all around great experience. My person favorite is the cheese toastie guy, Kappacasein. Don't end up disappointed like me and show up on the wrong day - he's only there Thursday - Saturday. Definitely plan to go on one of these days.||September 5, 2016
cmarshy5||50||always visit Borough Market when I visit London. I love this place. busy vibrant and happening atmosphere. Wonderful selection of food,cheeses, fish,meats and breads, plus much much more. Places to buy a lovely chilled glass of sparkly to walk around with. great selection of take away food to tempt you from all around the world. a must if visiting london.||September 5, 2016
Nicky W||50||We visit every time we go to London, the stalls and their produce are fantastic. You can try and taste, buy food and drinks to eat on the go or choose from the amazing array of produce to take home. The stall holders are passionate about their products and make the whole experience even more enjoyable. Great places round the edges for coffee or to eat. A visit to Neals Yard Dairy is a must too.||September 5, 2016
U4506IMannem||50||There are loads of different stalls and vendors, so you always have something to choose from. I love the meat and produce available here. It can get pretty crowded by mid-day, so I recommend heading over early in the day.||September 5, 2016
AussieSK||50||The Borough Market was on our list of places to visit in London. As we strolled along the Thames on our way to The Globe Theatre and The Tower Bridge, the path we followed lead to the Borough Market. The Borough Market is a food market where you can buy individual serves of paella from an enormous paella pan, order organic freshly squeezed juices, sample cheeses from the English countryside, buy freshly baked loaves of bread and even learn how to make bread in bread making classes and get just about any produce you can imagine. There are also cafes and restaurants where you can dine in for a tasty meal ranging from a sandwich to a multi course Mediterranean meal. The Borough Market is abuzz and alive. It is a dynamic market with heaps of hot food, food tastings, a great atmosphere, enticing smells and throngs of people that all add to the market’s ambience. Don’t miss it.||September 5, 2016
tawl1504||40||They have a huge variety of food from different cultures and the prices are affordable. Now the problem is, it gets far too crowded. This would be a good place for all food lovers.||September 4, 2016
bonsai244||50||So much food so much choice !! Lots of tasters available :) Some things are a little overpriced but if you consider the ambience and fun side , its good value. We've been many times and will def return Shame its only Thurs/Friday\Saturday||September 4, 2016
Bicycleblondy||50||What a great place, bustling with people and loads of different types of stalls & a wide variety of different types of food to eat. The only negative is there was nowhere to sit and eat your food, many people went out side but this wouldn't be much good if it was raining. ||September 4, 2016
Judycrook||50||I love going here, people watching and tasting the different cuisines available . This time I had a halloumi burger, it was cooked to order and delicious. Lots of handmade products available. Different breads and cakes available. Plus great fruit and veg stalls. The cheeses are fantastic too ||September 4, 2016
Allen G||50||A great barbers shop at the heart of the market good value and friendly staff. Highly recommended a must.||September 4, 2016
Boarders1954||40||A rabbit warren of food and drink. So many choices - so many different types of food and drink. A few nice little cafes and pubs on the fringe to eat at. A very enjoyable place to visit||September 4, 2016
Stewart50||40||Definitely worth a visit if you enjoy interesting/different foods, or hard to find foods. Lots of places to find a snack, with some restaurants/cafes close by too. Could have spent far longer than the hour that we had, just leisurely browsing each of the shops. Most of it is undercover too.||September 4, 2016
185armans||50||It's a paradise on earth! Many kinds of street food and not only! From fresh ice cream and brownies to oysters, burgers and crepes!||September 4, 2016
kenzie3110||50||I had been to London previously but never managed to see the borough market. I made sure on this visit that it was near the top of my lit of things to see and I'm so glad I did. Such amazing produce and the market is very pretty also. Stallholders were all very friendly and the place has a good atmosphere. So much food to choose from.||September 4, 2016
Jemimagold||10||After reading all the praise about Borough Market, I decided to go see what all the fuss was about one Saturday afternoon. I was decidedly unimpressed due to:- Very heavy crowds, jostling and pushing each other to get around the market.- Takeway food is served in cheap paper containers that you have to eat standing up (while being jostled by the hordes of people).- It attracts loads of hen parties/bachelorette parties thus drunk screaming women looking worse for wear.- I withdrew money from an ATM there and unbeknownst to me, a criminal had installed an ATM card reader. In the next couple of days, he withdrew a total of GBP 800 from my checking account. I definitely have no interest in returning.||September 3, 2016
Alicebub32||50||Very pretty market, old fashioned interesting buildings and shops, including fish places, like a market maze worth a visit ||September 3, 2016
Eileen O||50||WOW! What a great food and history tour. Our guide, Steve D, was perfect. Charming, funny, knowledgeable and a true foody. We had very fresh fish & chips, champagne and strawberries, the world's best donut, ciders & cheeses, tea and sticky toffee pudding. We strolled around the market, into a beautiful church and along the Thames. Best tour for the $$ anywhere||September 3, 2016
jordia149||40||We spent about three hours in the market on a Saturday from 11am. At the beginning was not too crowded but starting at noon more and more people started to fill the place. It is great to have a walk around and try different kind of foods, from cheese and sweets to meat, fish, cakes and also drinks like sangria, cider, beer, champagne and wine. We finally decided to order some pasta on one of the places and it was really great, cooked in 4 minutes and delicious. Great option for lunch and with a wide range of options and prices. Fully recommended. ||September 3, 2016
111michelley||50||What can I say? I love a good food market - tons of produce and foods to sample. It's busy but worth it.||September 3, 2016
JimmyLolly||50||Wow if you want a night out on a Saturday check out the Beerkeller below (and now above) Borough Market!!!Bob on Tuba is stunning performing hits from Meat Loaf to, well... Beer was flowing a bit too much and I can't remember after that haha!!||September 3, 2016
Reece-Travology||50||So many miraculous food stalls you'll your biggest worry is deciding what to eat! Foodie heaven. From fresh produce to flowers, baked goods to beverages, the list goes on! Arrive around 11am to miss the crazy lunch rush.||September 3, 2016
JM4k||50||Amazing market, with so many different types of foods. The pop up food stalls are amazing and there is so much choice! If you are ever in this part of London I would definitely recommend visiting!||September 3, 2016
ellen k||40||A really wonderful market with so many exotic and local specialties. Freshly prepared foods, drinks, meats, cheeses,etc. The only drawback is that you can barely get through the market as it is packed front to back and side to dide with long lines at the most popular stalls. I bought a Scotch egg that was cheaper at HARROD'S!||September 3, 2016
Neil P||50||It is exactly what it says on the tin, if you are a foodie then it delivers at every stage of the journey.Exotic, local produce, atmosphere, sheltered, free, fun but start buying stuff and it soon adds up.Disabled parking, relatively level, accessible loos.Win win win win win. Let's all get fat!||September 2, 2016
1775sarah||50||Every time we visit London we try to visit borough market. Such a fantastic, vibrant market and the food is delicious. I chose the vegan food this time. Loved it!! ||September 2, 2016
luckys15||40||If you are looking for some fairly cheap food and an outing I suggest Borough market. The atmosphere and smells are awesome. There is just so much to look at. Definitely one not to be missed. Centrally located and easy enough to findicate. Prices range from 4 to 10 pound as far as I saw.||September 2, 2016
Taneeta D||40||I stumbled on Borough Market on my way to another location, but was taken in by all the different foods - and how beautiful a lot of the confections were! If you're looking for something local to eat, take a walk around this market and see what tickles your fancy. ||September 2, 2016
mohammedi34||50||This was my first visit to this market. It was an enjoyable experience and wish I had the chance to see it earlier. It is great for families and friends. It consists of many shops that display fruits and vegetables, cheese, meat, seafood..,etc. It is good for shopping as well as enjoying the presented goods.||September 2, 2016
chriswikkins||50||This is truly a food market (not an everyday market so don't come here expecting to buy hats etc). It is an incredible open air market that's really close to the Shard and tower bridge. The Market is an amazing food market with small and large stalls selling food from all parts of the world. I came by this on a small food tour I was on and it blew me away. The sights and smells are incredible, take your time and take it all in.||September 2, 2016
highguyuk||30||We visited the market on the recommendations of this site, as somewhere “alternative” to find lunch. The market is very easy to find from London Bridge tube station and is split on either side of a small road. The site contains lots of permanent market stalls, which are more suited to those living locally who have produce to buy, and also stalls for lunch/takeaways/cakes etc.There is a bustling section of the market with a row of approx. a dozen stalls selling a range of food options – burgers/wraps/curries etc. This is where we ate and the quality and price of the food was reasonable. The market has a small seating area, relatively tucked away from the stalls and should be made substantially bigger. The architects have clearly gone for style over substance.I think overall we were a little disappointed with the market as a tourist. There isn’t much to see, rather just somewhere to buy dinner, which you can do in many places all over London rather than travelling specifically to the market. The food was great, but just as good as street food available everywhere.||September 2, 2016
PhilSandersKent_UK||50||Well worth a visit - quality foods and wine that you will not find in your local supermarket. Able to taste before you buy. Highly recommended.||September 2, 2016
KarenC1806||50||Love love love Borough Market, one of the best food markets I have ever been too, and I've been to a good few around the world, perfect coffee from Monmouth, best pork and crackling rolls from Roast to Go, loved looking round and seeing all the amazing stalls, big shout out to the Ginger Pig best pork in the UKA must visit for locals and tourists alike ||September 1, 2016
Germangirl76||50||I wish I could spend a whole day eating my way through this market. There are so many wonderful food choices!||September 1, 2016
Joseph G||50||Borough Market is one of those areas which one must visit and enjoy. It is a rich display of flavors, colors, sights and sounds which simply stimulate the senses. I recommend carrying plenty of British pounds as you will find something that attracts your attention for purchase. I also recommend sampling the foods as you stroll past the food stalls. You will find everything from fresh fish to fresh fruit, cheese, meats, chocolates, ice creams, and flowers. Don't be shy and ask the vendors questions about their goods and enjoy a sample of the food.||September 1, 2016
P7627PGmarinac||50||I had heard about this place, and stumbled across it by accident, and what a find it was, I was on my way to see the Golden Hind , and this food market was in the same place, there is so much street food to discover, Indian , Thai,Asian, pies, designer scotch eggs, it is a food lovers heaven, it does get very busy at lunchtime and is open until 10 pm , I would love to go at night as the atmosphere during the day was mind blowing , will definitely be going for another visit ||September 1, 2016
internationalvoyager||40||Borough Market is teeming with happy people from baby to old, stalls selling delicious foods, tasting possibilities (honeys, olive oils, breads). A fun Saturday brunch stop. The Raclette is delicious ... worth the short wait to pay and watch them prepare your walk-around meal. There is truly something for everyone. ||September 1, 2016
Matvl||50||This is a great market. More exhibition and spot for some food that real food shopping - though plenty of speciality options with the latter if you'd like to. Fresh fruit and veg is amazing though pricy; a good place for some interesting foodie shopping and gifts to take home with you if you're in the market for this. Also mostly covered so ok if the weather is miserable. Very busy on Saturday so try for Thursday or Friday.||September 1, 2016
JPNoz||50||Take some cash, go after 10.30am and enjoy the diversity of foods and products available to eat. Free tastes are available so you can try before you decide! Some stores take cards.||September 1, 2016
NuaMurf||50||Went there on a Saturday afternoon, it was bustling with activity. Tried the Ethiopian stand for lunch and it was amazing.It has every kind of food you could think. There was also a gluten free food stand with lots of cakes! A must to visit if you're nearby!||August 31, 2016
stuheadley||40||It's a food market, a very busy food market. There's a massive choice. I enjoyed a chorizo roll and a Malaysian curry. Both I thought were excellent value for money. I could have eaten another chorizo roll it was so tasty. Huge range of fresh meats and fish with plenty of cheese stalls too. It's a must visit if you have the time. ||August 31, 2016
Darby A||50||This is an excellent food market. And perfect to eat out as the food is absolutely excellent better than a few local restaurants We got a bottle a champagne and a Chinese and just enjoyed the atmosphere best meal of the weekend ||August 31, 2016
scottsimenauer||50||One of the best markers I have been to. Don't go if you hate crowds, definately go if you like food. Christmas time is magical :)||August 31, 2016
168debrai||40||We visited Borough Market mid afternoon on a Thursday and some of the stalls were winding up for the day. I would advise visiting earlier in the day. Still an interesting place and some yummy treats!||August 31, 2016
MichaelBanks||50||Was amazed how big this place was when I first arrived. So many smells and colors going on all at once... Vendors are very friendly and generous with samples.. When visiting London I go here to stock up on fruits, jerky, and beverages... A must see and experience when in London. Great for most ages and the prices are pretty reasonable... ||August 30, 2016
Ofir B||50||a great food market with a lot of fresh vegetables, seafood, and street food!! the atmosphere is amazing and all the food is delicious..||August 30, 2016
BrisbaneBetty||50||Not everything is open on a Tuesday but don't be put off as there's still lots of stalls open and one can only consume so much! Between us we had a good go at trying some different things. First we shared a cheese and olive stick,then fresh juice,vegetarian Indian curries,shaved lamb with salad,prosecco,coffee and pistachio Turkish delight. Jealous?? You should be! Borough Market can't be missed when in London.||August 30, 2016
AL1900-2300||50||It is a great place to eat and have some drinks; you can find many different kinds of meals. It is really nice to spend a lunch in the market and walk along the different places||August 30, 2016
LondonCher||50||Love this place. English market at its best. Although always lots of tourists around it is packed full of British people. In my opinion this is always a good sign, when I eat abroad I like to find places the locals go to. Let's face it you are not usually disappointed that way. Most food groups catered for. The hot cooked food stands are delicious and there are plenty of cold meat, cheese , olives and bread stands. Cakes galore and even oysters. Go hungry and take a good sized cool bag to carry goodies home in. Little samples on a number of stands which is nice. Little piece of sad advice but hold onto your valuables, unfortunately like all busy places this is where the professional thieves will work. CLOSED SUNDAY. which is a shame||August 29, 2016
dace520||50||Be careful if you are hungry before you arrive, as you need time to search the market for the place you want. The many aromas wafting throughout the area will tempt everyone. The open stalls with super displays. The various cooking establishments - take-away to more upmarket restaurants juggle together to bring you flavours from around the world. Just a wonderful experience ....||August 29, 2016
faybem||50||The sights, the smells and the atmosphere is truly terrific! This is such a wonderful place to go!We visited here for a bite to eat after a visit to The Shard.. We were truly spoilt for choice and ended up with THE best cheese toastie, ever!!!! There really is so much choice, food flavours from around the world! It really is a must visit for both local and tourists! ||August 29, 2016
BJC84||50||Been here a few times on our own as well as introducing it to friends. It has a traditional feel and if you look hard you can see places used in films (Bridget Jones, being a key one but there are others). Just walk and sample the atmosphere not in the covered market but also the surrounding streets. A point worth noting is to go when the market is on as it is far more lively, well recommended.||August 29, 2016
burtonashley||40||Lots of great street food, ingredients and other quirky bits and bobs but if you're not one for crowds I certainly wouldn't recommend going here on hot Saturday afternoon.||August 29, 2016
MikeHYorkshire||10||I was so looking forward to going to borough market but to find it was fully closed on a bank holiday Monday having looked on the website the night before was hugely disappointing sadly exit time I think just one for my wife and I||August 29, 2016
PhilLDarwen||50||If you want to eat but not sure what you want then visit the market - you can taste all day long & the smells are wonderful - when you have wandered around you can make your choice, then have something else. Definitely lose a couple of hours here .- ||August 29, 2016
DaisyTurnip||50||I was told to visit Borough Market by a friend. I'd never heard of it. It would seem everyone has heard of Borough Market, except me.It was simply out of this world! Awesome. Fabulous. Just thoroughly brilliant.If you're a foodie, you'll absolutely love it.If you need to eat, you'll absolutely love it.We went early afternoon and wish we had gone much earlier. It was heaving. Fabulous vibe. Just go. You won't regret it.||August 28, 2016
Abbotsbury92||30||I wandered through here on a walk around the Borough neighbourhood in early May en route to Southwark Cathedral, which abuts it. It's a busy market. Lots of fresh food and activity. Nice to see it bustling and lively. If in the area, stop by. It's a pretty steel lattice structure and worth enjoying, even if you don't have a bite of anything.||August 28, 2016
xvictoriax||40||Another stumbled upon venue. I enjoyed my veggie burger ( mints the bread) from the veggie burger stall. It was fresh and delicious. There are traditional English foods such as pork pies which you may prefer. Also juices, sweets and places ( limited) to sit down. ||August 28, 2016
RosaT89||50||So many amazing food stalls you'll no doubt struggle with deciding on what to eat! You can buy take away, desserts, cheese, fresh produce, baked goods, alcoholic beverages, flowers, the list goes on! We made the mistake of having breakfast before heading here and ate purely because we couldn't resist the temptation. ||August 28, 2016
WendyDeKnoop||50||Fresher than fresh you can't get it! Amazing wraps with grilled prawns and salad! Wealth of choices in cheese, coffee is fantastic here! Fresh fish, fruit and veggies! Lots of pubs! It's lovely to spend the day here and walk to the Thames where you will find lots of other shops to explore! ||August 28, 2016
HattieGrey||50||I've been to Borough Market several times now and I love it! There is a great range of things to try - fresh fruit and veg, cheeses, cured meats and sweet treats. In summer there are plenty of places selling sangria and prosecco to enjoy while you walk around the market and in winters the always mulled wine and cider. There are so many free tasters that you could spend the day eating there and not spend a penny, but I would recommend picking up any one of the many lunch options to enjoy in the yard of the nearby church. Borough Market is a great way to spend a day in London.||August 28, 2016
157FrankS||40||nice, nicer on Saturday since then there is a real on the go food market. Lots of good food to be eaten and for sale.||August 28, 2016
Tessa I||50||Have visited many times before and I love the experience of walking round this market. There's an amazing choice of food from the exotic to the daily. Choose from foods such as crocodile burgers to lobsters, carrots to mushrooms of the most beautiful colors. There is always a lovely atmosphere and alot of temptations during your visit. There are many places to eat from including street food and small restaurants. I would recommend the Borough brownies they are amazing.||August 27, 2016
ronnyjd0509||50||Borough market is a very nice place to hang around and find some of the best fresh food you can get in London! The atmosphere is really something special but you will love it! Really a nice market to visit during your stay in London.||August 27, 2016
alain p||50||Borough Market open from Monday to Saturday, located opposite to London Bridge Station is without a doubt the best food market in London. What sets Borough Market apart is the quality of the food, the friendliness of the vendors, the diversity of the food, the location and the buzzing atmosphere. For locals it is the exceptional quality of the produce and veg. The options for vegans, vegetarians or gluten / diary intolerant individuals are varied. The market is a five to ten minute walk from Southbank pathway which is a great spot to walk down and take in the city of London. If you visit the market on a Saturday, get ready for big crowds especially early in the morning and lunch time. Borough Market features close to 120 food stalls combined with seafood and chain restaurants serving varied dishes such as oysters, pulled pork, chorizo sandwiches and fresh juices. My recommended spots include Brindisa, a fantastic Spanish restaurant, store and stall serving succulent hot paprika-fuelled chorizo plucked from the grill and plunged into a chewy ciabatta roll alongside sweet, slow-roasted piquillo peppers and fresh peppery rocket, before being finished with a drizzle of fruity olive oil. My other recommended spot would be Furness Food But which cannot be missed as it features an enormous paella pan which serves tubs of piping hot, perfectly cooked paella rice steeped in seafood stock and topped with a generous portion of chicken and seafood. Also on offer at this popular stall – Shetlands salt & pepper squid, Wild Highland venison steak burgers and traditional Malaysian chicken curry. Like most things in London, Borough Market has an amazing history. The Act of Parliament from 1754 that helped establish Borough Market in its current form was very clear about the importance of the market for the local community. The Market would, it was written, remain “an estate for the use and benefit” of the local community “for ever”. Not for weeks or months or even centuries, but for all eternity. The market is administered and managed by a charitable trust, run by a board of volunteer trustees.||August 27, 2016

Jenny W||50||If you are looking for something different to eat, something special, this is the place. There is something for every taste. Just don't go there on a full stomach, be ready to try what you can.||August 27, 2016
bazzamandanga||50||Food heaven pretty much food for any tastebuds. If you enjoy food well worth a visit. Plenty to choose from. Fresh oysters from £1.50, Artisan cakes breads and so much more!!||August 27, 2016
Nigel_Thornberry_KBE||40||A must-visit detour on any walk along the South Bank of the Thames.We visited on a Saturday when it opens early (0800) and tends to have more Street Food vendors along with all the regular stalls and shops. A great alternative to a cafe or restaurant for a quick meal or snack throughout the day. Just be aware you WILL want to graze all manner of unusual and unique twists on good food, from wraps and pulled pork rolls to seafood, cheeses and beautiful baked goods and cakes.Just don't be surprised when your tummies are as full as your wallet is empty.... then you go round again to pick up something special for dinner from one of the butchers or fishmongers.Something for everyone.||August 27, 2016
Maxxie5||50||A must see when visiting London. Wonderful stalls with amazing food. All types of food and specialty items. Everything from fresh fruit, produce, cheeses, meats, prepared foods of all types.Great atmosphere on a Saturday with many outdoor eating places and cuisines of all types. Old architecture and a real cool vibe with old world charm. Can get crowded on Saturday but well worth the visit! Not open on Sunday.||August 27, 2016
midwestwanderer30||50||During the 6 days we spent in London, we made a point to visit the Borough Market on a daily basis. From the fresh bread, cheese, meat, fruit and veggies, to the hot coffee and wines - we had excellent choices for travel lunches, snacks and lunch. The vendors offered wonderful curries, too. Don't miss!||August 27, 2016
laurajZ4009CS||50||This amazing market is easy to find coming out of the tube station. Local producers, veg, cheese, deli, bread, and all sorts of assorted goodies. Lots of street food vendors to choose from, lines form of hungry Londoners around lunch time. I had a delish duck wrap with sauce amazballs. (£7) Feast for the eyes, mouth and sole. ||August 27, 2016
Lisa T||50||Went to Borough Market and popped into Roast for breakfast - this restaurant is lovely we had a table overlooking the market and the sun was blazing through the huge windows. The staff were all really friendly and polite and attentive and the range of food was very good and not too expensive||August 26, 2016
341jennyt||50||I am gluten and dairy intolerant, so for me eating in restaurants is more difficult. But here each stand puts the ingredients of alot of their produce, so that you can see whether you have an allergy to their food. So many different options, including "The Free From Bakehouse", where you can get a variety of different cakes, cookies and cheesecakes, which for me is very exciting as I usually cannot eat desert!Whatever you fancy, you are most likely able to find it at Borough Market, there is a huge variety of different produce and cooked food. Everything is so fresh and reasonably priced, an average lunch will set you back between £6-10, which is what you would spend in Pret anyway. A must visit in London, best place to get fruit and veg, as well as smoothies and cooked food.||August 26, 2016
Eaze||40||So much goodness in one place! Lovely market to visit, do try to make it on one of the full market days - and come hungry! Venison burgers, small batch ice cream shakes, french pastries, fresh fruit, and lots more. Some seats nearby, but I recommend taking your food with you down to the Golden hind, much cooler and quieter in the summer.||August 26, 2016
LW1963||50||An interesting range of stalls and shops.Fabulous fresh fish, meat and fruit and veg. Lots of samples and places to eat. Well worth a visit if you're interested in food. xx||August 25, 2016
JBeverley||50||Visit time and time again Always find something new V good for foodies Best to visit earlier on in the week as so much less crowded than on the weekend ( although may be less market stalls) Afterwards walk down the side of Southwark Church (peaceful and free to visit) towards the Thames for lovely views||August 25, 2016
Cac1234||50||Borough Market is a great place to try local grub. There are many vendors all within feet from one another. Is gets quite crowded at times and one may have to stand and eat or take his/her food to go. Great variety and good prices.||August 25, 2016
Hjk88||50||Terrific place to roam around, eat good street food, great produce, wines, beers, coffees, you name it. ||August 25, 2016

Inoku||50||Heaps of great food! Come with a few friends so you can try them allllll! Duck confit was a standout.||August 25, 2016
maurermichael||50||I stumbled upon Borough Market by accident and have been back a countless amount of times. There are stalls upon stalls selling the most exciting variety of food. If you can think it up, it is likely that it will be there. Indian, African, German, English and Japanese just to name a few - the stalls range from raw ingredients to full-on meals. It is an engrossing atmosphere, and a place where every corner holds a hidden surprise. You won't be disappointed!||August 25, 2016
John H||50||This is an incredible open air market in the city of London. It is very close to the Shard so you can combine both trips. The Market is an amazing food market with small and large stalls selling food from all parts of the world. The sights and smells are incredible and if you wander around trying all the free samples you can have a free lunch! The atmosphere was wonderful with peoples of all races and nationalities all having a great time. We both enjoyed some oysters at £1.50 each - well worth it.||August 25, 2016
Dwkerux||50||If you are in the area, this is a must. Food, food and more food. What a great experience. Also a great place if you're into people watching. If I went back I'd go with an empty stomach. ||August 24, 2016
Giulia A||40||Borough market is the best place to be regarding the food both if you live in london or if you are just traveling. There are a lot of nice shops in which you can buy different kind of food. In particular,since i'm Italian, i've been attracted from the shops that were selling Italian product and i've found out that they have the real one such as mozzarella di bufala or parma ham!So if you are an Italian living in london or just an Italian traveler that is missing the Italian taste you MUST go to that market! ||August 24, 2016
bmonkman||50||The Borough Market is a covered, open air (not a contradiction) area that houses a collection of stalls selling an eclectic variety of goods. You can find pretty much anything food related here. There is also a great collection of restaurants, sit down and take away, that will satisfy a wide variety of foodie interests. One of the wonderful things about the market is the atmosphere. It is both frenetic and laid back. You can stroll through looking at all of stalls at a very leisurely pace. Yet the people working the stalls are hustling their butts to take care of customers. It is within sight of the Southwark Cathedral and an easy walk from the London Bridge tube station.||August 24, 2016
Dav1d_985||50||What a place! Every time I visit Borough Market I leave with a full stomach and bags of goodies! The choices available are endless, from a small piece of fruit through to kangaroo burgers! If you are looking for a special place to grab some lunch or a quick snack, Borough Market is the place. If you want to try something out of the oridnary, I would recommend visiting the exoctic meats stall (unless you're vegetarian!). The market is pretty big and you'll wish that you could eat everyrthing. It does get busy at peak times, so be prepared to queue.Lot's of pubs near by and a short walk from the River Thames.A must try!||August 24, 2016
mariean2inette||50||We hopped in a cab near Buckingham Palace and asked the cabbie to take us to any cafe or restaurant. We decided to head back to Kensington, until he recommended we visit the Borough Markets. Best decision ever! The food was amazing. We had a hog roll, which has been the most memorable dish of our holiday thus far. This should definitely be on everyone's 'to do list'.||August 24, 2016
travellertrail6||50||Visiting london and not visiting Borough Market is like committing sacrilege. I am sure there are other good markets too but as a first timer to london, the borough market is a perfect way to spend a couple of hours. The market is a delight to ones taste buds and also to the eyes. Amazing fresh produce of veggies and fruits, seafood and meats and freshly prepared food from around the world is what you can find here. I had lunch at this place and even some dessert.||August 23, 2016
341deannep||50||Whether you are a tourist to London or a resident you really must go to Borough Market. This place is probably the totally best way to spend a Saturday morning. Only 2 mins walk from London Bridge station. The area is packed with loads of quirky restaurants, bars, pubs, coffee shops etc surrounding and amongst the market itself, do remember to look up as loads above the market too. However I think the real joy of this place is trying out the various foods on offer from all the stalls. You can literally eat anything and everything here, literally!!! From Malaysian, Korean, Chinese, gourmet sausages, wild boar, pies, noodles, paella, if you can think of it, you can eat it!! You can of course buy every type of ingredient you might ever want here too. Every stall sells the best quality produce or they can't sell here. The salamis, cheeses, bread, oils, veg, spices, pasta, meats are like nothing you've seen elsewhere. Many stalls are highly specialised, look out for the mushroom stall which has dozens of varieties, spice mountain, the French cheese stall, etc. Maria's cafe in the centre of the market is worth trying at least once too. Be warned the market is slightly split in two by a small side road that dissects it so do cross over and continue through the archway or you'll miss half of it! Perfect place to take those hard to please teenagers! Trust me they'll love it. Don't visit this place on a full stomach as you'll miss out and allow a couple of hours at least as there's loads to see and try. ||August 23, 2016
ClairePaterson||40||This place is great, almost too good. I'd recommend you eat as many little dishes as possible (or share if you can) because it will be impossible to chose just one. It can get very busy if going at peak times so be prepared for the crowds but there are enough stalls for the queues to be short.||August 23, 2016
Wraxall_Travellers||50||This maret is deceptive as it goes on for ever. A great spot for in the hoof lunches and plenty of good eat in spots too. All sorts of food treats to be discovered.||August 23, 2016
Q4682ZNsandrag||50||well what can I say what an amazing place everything you need in one place. The colours are fantastic a whole load of different food to buy highly recommended go yourself and see amazing lots of bars and restaurants there as well also street food too ||August 23, 2016
Gman789||50||My girlfriend recommend here and I was shocked I never heard of it after living in London for 3 years as the food was so good!! We were spoiled for choice.||August 23, 2016
Deano1957||50||This place is a must visit when you are in London, the many, many stalls are packed full of the sellers produce from all over the country. A tip is to go early to avoid the crowds or later on when it's nearly closed as you will pick up some real bargains.We were eating oysters and clams at one stall and they were practically giving them away.||August 23, 2016
Loretto C||50||This place was a lot of fun. What character! Its not like anything that you will find in the States. Go on the weekend to get the true experience and plan to have lunch.||August 23, 2016
ZOEBOWIE16||50||Easy to find from London Bridge tube station (turn right on exit). It's food/drink heaven. We managed to spend hours here when expecting to move on quite quickly. You can find something for everyone here and with such a great atmosphere, I will return.||August 23, 2016
alsaifahmad||40||Reminds me rambla market in Barcelona, the same still and many restaurant and bars around, it’s really good place to spend afternoon and by some grocery as well ||August 23, 2016
664beccae||50||My boyfriend and I absoloutely loved this place!!! We had the doughnuts there and they were amazing!!! It was busy in there but that didnt stop us... There is a huge variety of choices of foods. Definitely go and look.||August 23, 2016
GabrielleJCasey||40||I love Borough Market and it is one of my favourite places. Such a variety of food and drink and such a lovely atmosphere. Unfortunately though, because it is so good - everyone knows about it so on Saturdays it can get almost to the point where you can't move between stalls, and some of the stalls can be quite pricey dependant on what you get.There isn't any seating area's for the actual market, there are places around that have seating but you have to purchase something from them, so you may find that you'll have to eat standing - which is okay because its street food. If you're in Southwark with nothing to do - please visit - you won't regret it!||August 23, 2016
mlx11||50||I’ve lived close to Borough Market and been shopping there for the past 30 years. And it’s still one of my favorite places – not just in London; but anywhere.Difficult to explain why. It’s not a classic produce market – you won’t find endless mind-blowing displays of fruit, veg, fish or meat. There’s no real theme to it. It’s not specialist in anything. But I still go there and feel better for the experience.It is a bit of a tourist trap and you need to fight your way through on Saturdays. But fair enough, there’s plenty for visitors to do and see in surrounding Historic Southwark – Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre, Southwark Cathedral etc. - and the Market is a great place to take a break. Apart from anything else, there’s endless grazing at street-food stalls, cake stalls, coffee shops and restaurants.I mainly go to do the food shopping. And what draws me to the Market is quality, expertise and friendliness. The vendors I visit are a bit on the expensive side but the quality of their produce is excellent; the vendors’ knowledge is first-rate; and they are welcoming.This is a flavor of what I do. I don’t usually do everything in one visit and I avoid the biggest crowds by not going on Saturdays.I try to go early (10:00 Wednesday – Saturday is the official opening time) and have breakfast in Maria’s Market Café. That would be a fry-up of eggs, bacon & sausage with a mug of tea. Other people might add “bubble & squeak” (fried mashed potato & cabbage) that’s the speciality of the place. Don’t have coffee – save that till later.Then the fruit & veg. I would go to one of the big stalls in the middle of the market like Turnips or Elsey & Bent. But there are plenty of places to choose from.Meat next. The Ginger Pig is the place. Unless you are a strict vegetarian at least go and have a look at the display. Mouth-watering – especially the pies that you can buy and eat straight away. If you’re thinking of buying something, don’t be afraid to ask the butchers about it first. They know everything. They’ll also gladly slice, skin, dice or truss your meat and poultry any way you want it. The sausages and bacon are superb – but so is everything else.Coffee is just across the road but hang on for a while longer.Grab some bread (sourdough probably) from one of many stalls – I don’t have a preference.Then browse Spice Mountain. If you thought you’d seen every spice under the sun, think again.Perhaps it’s fish rather than meat today. Then off to Furness Fish Markets. Just stand there and photograph the display or lash out on lobster, dover sole, halibut, tiger prawns or whatever.Time for a break from food. Visit Borough Kitchen Cookshop. Inspect the rather pricy (but top quality) kitchen implements and perhaps buy the latest thing you need to improve your cooking standards.Then find Neal’s Yard Dairy for what I think is the finest selection of cheeses in London. You will probably have to stand in line to buy something but the wait will be worth it. All the staff are experts and will insist that you try a few samples before you buy. If you can’t make up your mind (or are just overwhelmed) they will tell you what cheese has just reached perfect maturity that very day. If you don’t want to buy just politely edge around the line and take a quick look in the main part of the shop – you have never seen so much cheese.Now it’s coffee time. You’ll probably have passed Monmouth Coffee, which is just round the corner from Neal’s Yard, and seen a line out in to the street. You have to join that line to buy a cup of coffee and to get a place at the big communal table in the shop. Breakfast there is great – you get loads of fresh baguette and homemade jam (at least it tastes homemade).Top tip: if you want to buy some beans or ground coffee just avoid the line and go straight to the counter on the right. Discuss today’s roastings with the servers and order a cup of coffee to go while you’re buying your beans. Don’t bother about the espresso machine; go for today’s filter coffee that is being made under your nose.Then do what I do – find somewhere nearby in the street to sip your coffee and watch other people enjoying Borough Market.||August 23, 2016

Rowan S||50||This is one of the best food markets in London and has a variety of foods and stalls. The food here is varied and of a very high quality. I visit regularly to buy spices from Spice Mountain. This is a must for food lovers.||August 22, 2016
156beatricec||50||Absolutely loved this market! Cusy atmosphere! You can by tasteful street food; pulled pork, fish, foccacia etc. Good vegetarian alternativas! The easiest way to go there is with tube (use a tube map to see how to travel)||August 22, 2016

Squidhead||50||Some friends and I explored the market on a sunny Saturday afternoon. I need to go back and take more time to sample some of the wonderful looking food and drink they had there. I recommend alloting a lot of time if you're hungry or thirsty! They have just about every kind of food you can imagine.||August 22, 2016
museummayhem||40||If you are walking along the South Bank, visiting the Globe etc... take some time out to browse the stalls in Borough Market. Touristy and a fantastic place to buy foodie gifts or specialities. Interesting cheeses, oils, breads, spices. The market is covered so it could be a rainy day activity although a beautiful summer day like the one we had is better.My son and my partner ate at a place called Wokit....they loved it! Bit expensive...but being a northener I'm not use to London prices.||August 22, 2016
LondonPjc||40||This is a great place to visit on a weekend, plenty of food options, interesting stalls offering food and drink tastings and reasonable prices.Thoroughly recommended||August 22, 2016
SimonRobinson56||30||Called in whilst walking around London. It mainly sells various types of food and drink. Most looked to be of high quality (and price). Plenty of pubs to choose from, but strangely we could find nowhere to get a simple cup of coffee. It's about 5mins from the Millenium footbridge or London bridge.||August 22, 2016
Valerie B||40||Great area to discover . A place for foodies . We walked from Westminster on the south bank . Got a great view of London along the way , and then you arrive in borough markets . Lots of food places and a great atmosphere to the area . Right by the shard and London Bridge station. Don't miss it ....!||August 22, 2016
Tasha5L||50||A great place for good, honest food producers and foodies alike. Great atmosphere, lovely store holders and family friendly. Recommend the prosecco stall, grab a glass of prosecco to start the day off with, also a great fresh fruit smoothie stand if you want . Great produce.||August 21, 2016
Ozgur C||50||must place to see in London. spices all around the world. I found some spices which I couldn t find anywhere. Nice cafe s and pubs. whatever is delicious, s there .. definitely visit!||August 21, 2016
Badooriq8||40||Very good varieties of cuisines with good quality and decent prices for London. You can also buy food for take home. There is also an adjacent market where you can buy sweets. The market is just a 3 minute walk from London bridge underground Station. I liked it much ||August 21, 2016
katiedJ1465GM||50||Brace yourself for a huge number of people, especially if you are here on a weekend at lunchtime. But it is totally worth fighting the crowds to experience the huge variety of food and drink on offer. Permanent and temporary stands but all offer great food. An average of 6-7 pounds for a meal but there is something for every palate. Definitely worth a trip if you like good food.||August 21, 2016
lilialopokova||50||Make sure you visit Borough Market on an empty stomach! So many choices, so much to see, the freshness of the food on offer is outstanding. We chose a hamburger and going by the long line of people waiting in the queue we were not going to be disappointed. A little on the expensive side, but certainly a great choice, I just wish we had another day free so that we could visit again while still in London. Most certainly make sure to add this place to your "must see" list for London. The entire market area is under cover, so if you experience any inclement weather this is somewhere to be out of the weather.||August 21, 2016
ssannamariaaa||50||I loved the market. Really enjoyed all the delicious food, the feeling of authenticity and the varieties of things sold here. Everything from fish to meat to spices to cutlery to fresh baked bread. Very lovely, lively place. I'd advice to go early as when the crowds start to gather it's quite hard to see what's in there. Prepare to spend at least an hour here. ||August 21, 2016
robertbM3768AI||50||Great Food in all kind of form and smell. Can only suggest to go there and have a bit with friends and enjoying the market with all the people.||August 21, 2016
H3164VZmatthewr||50||We went before lunch and were hungry - ate excellent oysters, pies and scallops washed down with some okay wine. This market is a great place to buy English food and priced well. The down side is seating. Hard to get a seat where you can enjoy the food - personally I don't 'eat and walk' so I would suggest a short stroll to the river where there are many spots to sit. The local coffee shop there is good but not as good as the queue might suggest. The oysters were fresh shucked and served with a crisp white at a small shop close to the Monmouth coffee - an excellent option. Evidence of a few 'overly' touristy places starting to creep in with USA style chocolate shops and non uk food. Well worth a look as part of the south bank experience.||August 20, 2016
traveleat7||50||I love Borough market..Fresh and local foods, so many samples and delicious food to try. Great for buying local produce or going for lunch. The "Ethiopian Flavours" stand is just divine! The food is delicious, a must try!||August 20, 2016
Chanon P||50||Borough market in fascinating market specialises in food and fresh produce. There are several quality stores. Many products sell here are also quite difficult to find elsewhere. However, it tends to be packed with tourists which makes it extremely unpleasant to visit.||August 20, 2016
Elizabeth M||50||We fell upon this market while walking London. Excellent food choices for every palate...even our picky eaters were happy! We sampled wild boar, goat, lamb, pork, beef, chicken, fish & shell fish...how many places can offer that! Delicious sweet treats, too...cheesecake & fudge were our favorites.||August 20, 2016
fish4travel||50||This was a recommendation from our hotel, what a delight! Buzzing, foods, street food, drinks - it's alive with smells, noise, people, such a great place and we didn't know it was there - Market Magic! Down the stairs, glass fronted feature, high street entrance - do try and find it and go, you'll love it I'm sure. We're going back....||August 20, 2016

maggie9||50||Day or evening, Borough Market is a stimulating place to visit! It teems with life, has several good restaurants, including Fish and Roast, and in the daytime, wonderful food stalls. It is adjacent to Southwark Cathedral, which is well worth a visit, too. Being close to the Shard and London Bridge station makes a visit a must. ||August 19, 2016
savvysue2016||30||Although a very pleasant market, I don't feel it offers the wow factor it could. It has loads of savoury stalls and few sweet, such a shame when we are so well known for our sweet tooth here in the UK. Fresh Fish market was probably the most popular stall when we were there.||August 19, 2016
ESB-UK||40||We drove past a couple of months ago on a Saturday, and the place was mobbed, but, having not been into the market for a couple of years, I was keen to go back midweek. As part of a long walk (from Southwark to Paddington), my first stop was the Market. FAB. Atmosphere, stalls (bought some spices at Spice Mountain), and food stalls (had the best toasted cheese sandwich ever). Lovely way to start (or end!) a walk.||August 19, 2016
alicebeeby||50||We visit London a lot and we have never been here before, now I realise we have been missing out. We went to a couple of museums in the area so thought we would wander through the market. We ended up getting a delicious lunch (Ethiopian curry) and spending lots of money on food! Lots of choice here and wonderful smells as you walk through. Don't visit if you are short of money though as everything is so tempting. Will definitely be visiting more often.||August 19, 2016
Palmbeacherpalmbeach||10||The decor ,service,atmosphere are all great.The food unfortunately is well below average I was looking forward to eating at Roast and was disappointed with it.The food was cold,overcooked and obviously been under a heat lamp for a few hours.before being served.The potatoes were dry warm on the outside,cold inside.The yorkshire pudding was cold and hard..The beef was actually not to bad.Overall not as good as expected If you enjoy good food.DONT EAT HERE.||August 18, 2016

CraneHolmes||50||Borough market has a great atmosphere with top class produce and food and drink producers. Pop in for something to eat there and then or take home . The walk through to the Thames leads you on to many attractions including Shakespeare's Globe. We really enjoyed our time here and will definitely visit on our next trip to London. ||August 17, 2016
SuzeJe||50||I love visiting the Borough Market every time I'm in London. The selection of fresh produce to buy is fantastic, there is street food from all over to choose from if one is feeling peckish. I always buy something confectionary, spices, pickles or jams to take back home for friends. On the way stop at Southwark Cathdral and admire the architecture.||August 17, 2016
Josh W||40||It is a bustling hub for both city workers and tourists alike, with plenty of types of street food and farmers market stalls they cater for almost every taste bud. Head over to Brick Lane for an alternative feel||August 17, 2016
enimsajmil76||40||Went to this market while on the way to Tower Bridge. There are 2 sections. 1 that sells cooked food and the other offers a range of stuff - olives, various mustard, bread, truffles, spices and etc. Like the Ethiopian rice and wrap at the cooked food section. Yummy! Would love to try more if my stomach can take the load. Will be back to try more stuff. ||August 17, 2016
karinvoodla||40||I visited Borough Market with my sister in March. It's always hard to find a place to eat in London as the prices can be really high, that's why I wanted to try the market. It was a bit hard to find the place at first as it's location isn't the best in my opinion, but our visit was worth the search. As everyone have mentioned, it can get crowded, but that's London, it's everywhere like that so you just have to choose the right time. We had some hummus and pita bread that was very tasty and later some donuts, that tasted incredibly. What I love the most about that place, is that it isn't THAT big and you don't have to walk around and hunt for the best prices. There are so many different options and you can find whatever fits you the best. Good place to have a cheap lunch, quick breakfast or just a tasty snack as a takeaway.||August 16, 2016
mlamalta||50||Great market if you're a foodie. Prices are on the high side (as expected) but everything we tried was genuine and delicious.||August 16, 2016
Crackinstuff||50||This market was wonderful, especially if you're a lover of all things organic! SO much to see with tasters along the way. Just wished I wasn't going home via numerous amount of tubes and train!||August 16, 2016
JasonCrete||40||This is such a lovely place. So many stalls, so much history...but unfortunately it has changed so much over the years and the traditional trade down there has all but gone. It is now just a haven for tourists (American and European mainly). You can find some good speciality food ingredients there, but you'll pay for it.||August 16, 2016
pmp007||40||avoid weekend and meal times. We went there for lunch and it was super crowded so very difficult to find and buy food. As in city center prepare yourself for super-ridicullus-pedant servers, as they have soo many people to serve they do not need to be nice to you. That has happened to me in burguers and wrap stalls. I would come back but on week days and before meal time.||August 16, 2016
David M||30||It is a beautiful market with lots of food to choose, but it is too much touristic, there are always thousand of tourists , what makes almost impossible to buy anything.It is a recommended place if you are a tourist.||August 16, 2016
Arpia4||50||You can find any type of food stuff here, and you can taste it or buy it. It has the wonderful and the inventive to the traditional. It is a feast for your eyes and taste buds. Warning: don't go there if you are very hungry, you will spend a fortune! But I love the oysters and variety of cheeses. So much to see and when you are tired you can stop in any of the very many coffee/bars in the area. ||August 15, 2016
BernieErvin||50||I got guided around the edges of this market and it's amazing there's so many different foods. We bought so much to eat later on. It's got a really good atmosphere and quite reasonable prices for London.||August 15, 2016
Christopher H||50||On a first visit, on a sunny Summer's day - what a place to meet friends, simply walk around, take in the sights, sounds, aromas and tastes! Really tasty foods to buy from many and very welcoming stalls, often with the invitation to taste first. And all in the most amazing setting under the ironwork, glass and tracks of Southwark, in the lea of the Cathedral. Very much looking forward to going back!||August 15, 2016
MrsRobertson83||50||Great market for food, bustling on a saturday afternoon. Wish we hadn't booked afternoon tea as we couldn't sample anything.||August 15, 2016
lisiczka0074||50||Borough Market, just outside the London Bridge tube station is a large roofed area offering both cooking ingredients/products as well as ready meals from all over the world.You can try a kangaroo steak, smell the lovely truffle oil or replenish your energy with a wheat grass shot.My top pick though is and amazing prawn wrap, available from the stand on Stoney Street, close to the entrance to the market. Large garlic prawns, just the right amount of sweet chili sauce wrapped in a nice tortilla is the perfect lunch meal. My friends coming from abroad want to come back to this place every time they visit!||August 15, 2016
CML42||50||This is a vibrant area of London, full of the sights, sounds and wonderful cooking smells of a busy food market. Endless choice of high quality food for an impromptu snack or lunch. We opted for paella which was delicious and included plenty of langustines. The glasses of chilled white wine and Pimms were just right for our our outdoor meal eaten in a clearing between the Thames and Southwark Cathedral. A visit to the Market is a must if you are in this area.||August 14, 2016
SimonGston||50||Fell in love with the market the first time I visited it, it's a must do whenever I am in London at my girlfriends house now. No end of amazing food to try! 100% worth a visit. ||August 14, 2016
JanZajic||50||Lovely place to have a break for great food-fish and chips, asian, burgers etc etc. Many food stalls with lots of different kinds!!||August 14, 2016
melanieskunz||50||it s nice to spend some time their and walk through the market. Even good when the weather is not that good. its perfect for foodies ;) ||August 14, 2016
Ilias_t_t||40||An interesting market. You can find products from different countries ( mostly from Europe ) at a price of course :)Easily accessible by bus or tube. Worth the visit||August 14, 2016
Tracycymru||50||Not good if you get claustrobia ! Huge market and a foodie heaven. We got snacks for a picnic and savoured them in St. James Park. The array of food, the quality of the produce is superlative. Even the arrangements of the fruits and vegetables makes you stop and admire. Have a quiet cuppa in the cafe at Southwark Cathedral before heading off to the market and enjoy||August 14, 2016
saradV6654WK||50||Took our friendly to the market as they live in the countryside ..... They were amazed at the different foods and bought so much really good atmosphere and reasonable prices for London ||August 14, 2016
BC_Tas||50||A must-do for any visitor to London! So many delicious things on offer. We went on a scorcher of a day during the heatwave and started with a Pimms, followed by a confit duck sandwich (amazing) and some yummy raclette potatoes. I could have easily stayed longer but my stomach was full and my wallet less so. Highly recommended!||August 14, 2016
Iran G||50||The best of the best! There's something for everyone. If you can start here before your walks and in the way back, that's right, stop here again! ||August 14, 2016
Mihaela A||50||During the week, it's not so crowded, but we loved it on Saturday, when it was so full of everything. Amazing street food, so, so good! You can buy excellent bread, chocolate, cakes, fresh shells, food from the whole England. Amazing mixture! Colours, flavours, different nationalities, you can enjoy all for hours! A must-do!||August 13, 2016
zellerific||50||We loved taking a short trip to Borough while between locations. Ended up getting some clotted cream fudge which was delicious and some great locally made coasters for family. Wish I could have taken all that cheese home on the plane!! ||August 13, 2016
cheesesalad||40||Some great food on offer. Order small dishes and try many different stalls. Ethiopean food stands out. You'll find it at the south side of London Bridge, not Tower Bridge people, we all know that mistake has been made before. Maltby Street Market is a good alternative.||August 13, 2016
johnnyk996||50||What a wonderful surprise and stunning location. There are so many different food stalls to pick from and you are not disappointed with what they offer. There is such a huge variety and there are some interesting and unique stall such the goats milk ice cream and the fresh produce stalls. You can people watch all day while spoiling yourself to some WONDERFUL food. A must seen when you in the area. You don't even have to be food lover to enjoy it! Just GO THERE!||August 13, 2016
Daisypita||50||Went yesterday and it was nice to go there, there're lot of stand to see fresh food and also lot's of places to eat! We had a steak sandwich at the argentine shop and was really tasty and good money for value! ||August 13, 2016
ferret18||50||What an amazing place - really lovely stalls and not too expensive either, which was a surprise. Easily reached from London Bridge.||August 13, 2016
AmritaJ||50||I hadn't even heard about this market, but it was the wrong turn I've taken. What a delightful visit!!! Wonderful produce, wonderful food stalls and a wonderful way to spend a few hours. ||August 13, 2016
ddbbtraveler||50||Great place for lunch! Open every day but Sunday you can find amazing food treats for lunch or early dinner. Most stalls offer free tastes which only causes me to purchase more than I expected. A foodie's paradise. ||August 13, 2016
Serhan A||50||Just dont stick with one! try and taste different cuisines as much as as you can. baby goat meat salad and ethiopian were the best.||August 13, 2016
SaraMariaRingsted||40||You can get A lot of things here. Most of Them is street food i Think. But very new thinking place, with A lot of tastes. Would come again another time.||August 13, 2016
Lyndmar||50||We were told that this market was good for people interested in different foods and we weren't disappointed. There are all sorts of street food cuisines and top quality fresh foods from around the world. Well worth a visit we are definitely going again.||August 12, 2016
alexhJ7053IG||50||There is loads to buy here, food from around the world, nik niks, plants, coffee etc, really worth going to!||August 12, 2016
efurz||50||Duck confit, chorizo sandwich, fresh berries, need I say more? These markets are wonderful and packed with many options for food and drink. We came around 10am on a Friday so it wasn't very busy and easy to look around at all the stalls.||August 12, 2016
Paul j||50||DO NOT MISS THIS...it is fascinating...even though it has been somewhat gentrified it offers a real taste of working london. the smells, sounds and goodies on offer make this a must visit...and the Shard is a 5 minute walk away...as it the river and Bankside area. Again DO NOT MISS THIS||August 12, 2016
Jay S||50||outstanding market with an abundance of variety throughout...a must to explore including the surrounding area with a hip and friendly vibe .....will be making frequent visits i assure you.....||August 12, 2016
604abbiet||50||An amazing market selling lots of fresh ingredients as well as cooked food too. My boyfriend and I came here around lunch time and enjoyed browsing round all the different stalls before each deciding where to eat. The scallops and chocolate doughnuts were beautiful! ||August 12, 2016
Francescoperroni84||50||I visit this place often when friends are in town as it offers a great variety of fresh food from all over the world. I have tried many different places and they are all consistently good in terms of quality and at a reasonable price. Recommended if you are into food!||August 12, 2016
AlienBa||50||We spent couple of hours enjoying and tasting.There is lots to see and taste so you need to arrive hungry... We visited on Friday which seems to be the best day to visit here. ||August 12, 2016
475sandy||50||We were amazed at the selection of food in the market and the treats we picked up were delicious. Try the shortbread cookies with walnuts at the Turkish booth, or a multitude of other tasty treats. We stocked up on unique spices and rather inexpensive truffle oil. I would recommend this stop to anyone who loves food and would like to find gourmet treats.||August 11, 2016
JWT93||40||The Borough markets always have a great range of food stalls serving dishes full of flavour and other stores serving quality fresh produce. There are multiple coffee shops around where you can get your preferred choice of brew while you can take in the sights and smells of the market. As with most things in London, you'll be charged overs for what you're getting but most of the food and produce here is very tasty. ||August 11, 2016
angelaraynal||40||Great market which hasn't become a total tourist spot. You can try some wonderful artisan produce, we bought some fruit and freshly made smoothies and sat in the sun to enjoy the buzz and people watch. Loads of places cooking fresh food while you wait, huge choice and it all smelled amazing. We had dinner reservations so did not eat here but will definitely return to sample some in the future. Very clean given how busy it is. Great way to spend an hour or two||August 11, 2016
KDxb||40||I love food markets in London. They have the best variety and amazing food and drink options. Borough market is the kind of food markets. From kebabs to Thai food they have it all. Besides the food stalls they also have a shopping part to it for ingredients. Do check it out as they have some amazing options. ||August 11, 2016
RobBos772||40||Great sounds, smells and (hopefully) tastes in this fantastic old covered market just south of London Bridge.It is in quite a bohemian area, and there are stalls selling food from every corner of the world - never seen Yugoslav cuisine before!We visited on a Tuesday, when the full market is not open, and it would probably be better to visit at lunch time when you could dample more food, but still well worth a trip.||August 11, 2016
jodien891||50||The smell of the market is incredible before you even get to it. So much good food and plenty of options for vegetarians and vegans too! Thumbs up. ||August 10, 2016
Dr_D_Kim||30||It's a good place for both locals who want to get some gourmet ingredients for special occasions, and tourists. You will find some of the fishmongers very grumpy around the closing time (especially the one near Stoney St selling jellied eel), but others are very friendly in general.||August 10, 2016
Χριστιάνα Π||40||It is a nice place, noisy with food kiosks of all the world. I ate once paella but it wasn't tasty. You can walk around the market and after go walking five minutes away to eat in the restaurants in front of the river, looking the beautiful view, the ships, the bridge and the buildings of City.||August 10, 2016
8024NZ||50||This is the oldest food market in London. All under cover, the stalls sell every food item you can think of, plus there are liquor stalls as well. Fresh fruit and vegetables, the olive shops, chocolates, fish, poultry, meats, many not seen in a NZ butchery, and quite a lot of the produce is organic. Then there are the food stalls with sandwiches, pies, pizzas, fish and chips, fruit juices and smoothies, wines, cocktails, it's all there and everything is freshly made with fresh ingredients and they don't skimp on size. Toilets are available and after wandering around the market, tasting produce samples, eating your hard decided food choice and dodging the huge crowds, you can venture out of the market to the river and see the sites of the area, which includes Southpark Cathedral and a great view of The Chard. There are also lots of pubs and cafes in the region.||August 10, 2016
jcannan01||50||Great place here, buzzing atmosphere, amazing sights smells and colour, lots of amazing food, with cheese stalls a highlight, all washed down with a couple of glasses of fizz, top place||August 10, 2016
ctbrit||50||Beautiful food market surrounded by fantastic architecture.Definitely worth a visit if you are in town.Great place to take visitors.||August 10, 2016
jessicacX5892FB||50||Love this spot! Wished we had something like this where I live. The quality of foods, both fresh and prepared was unbelievable. Can't wait to go back!||August 10, 2016
Zelie91||50||So much choice in ready to go food stalls, fruit and veg i couldnt even begin to explain. But great quality, they have the best bread. And you dont have to purchase anything you can just have a stroll and leave. Great vibe highly recommend. ||August 10, 2016
_V5908VQ||50||i went there once and for sure on my next visit to London I will go again!. I really loved this place. Is a large market with raw food ingrediants and ready meals. You should definitely got to go there to eat and drink. Its a must!||August 10, 2016
Signe K||50||This is where you want to go if you have to cook your own meal in London.... or if you need a meal on the go. The smells of herbs and home cooked food linger in the air and it's full of people during the day. Take your time to look around all the corners, because there are more shops and stalls than you notice at first. And I guess that the best recommendation was that the pest control officers ate their lunch at the market while we were there. I have to revisit next time I'm in London. ||August 10, 2016
radfordred||50||This was one of our highlights of our trip to London the place was buzzing & packed when we arrived around noon Saturday, fantastic different street food smells & wines beers from all over the world, well worth a look even if your not eating a must visit.||August 10, 2016
721samanthai||50||This is a fantastic place to visit when you're in London. There is a ton of food and drinks available in the various stalls. You can buy stuff ready made, or if you are able to make your own meal, find a huge variety of fresh ingredients. Pretty much anything you could think to want could be found here.||August 9, 2016
traveltheworld1776||50||Large market for raw food ingredients and ready to eat meals. Come hungry, so many things to try! The fresh made pasta dishes were our favorite along with watermelon water.||August 9, 2016
1KLT||50||An atmospheric market with an outstanding choice of aromatic, freshly cooked, attractive, delicious food. We had to walk round the stalls 3 times before deciding what to have for lunch. Pieminister won on the day and we were not disappointed with a delicious moo pie, mash, minty peas and gravy. Now every time we're in London, Borough Market will be on our MUST DO list, hmmm... wonder what we'll try next?||August 9, 2016
susie1717m||50||I love this super market !!!!Part indoors, part outside.There are some great acts to watch rather like Covent Garden.The building is like a big conservatory and you can grab a coffee or wine and sit around listening to music and chatting or wander into the outside area ( which is all street food, cakes, artisan breads, fresh juices, Asian foods, olives etc ) The smell of spices and Asian food hits you and really gets the taste buds going. My problem is always too much choice.Well worth a visit !!!!!!!||August 8, 2016
RoosK||50||Try to go on a weekday to avoid crowds. Market begins closing down at 4. Scotch tails was amazing as was pieminister||August 8, 2016
dpuck1998||50||Loved walking through the market, our flat was just around the corner. We would walk through daily, often grab a bite or at least a drink. This was one of the best markets I've ever seen.||August 8, 2016
Katharine G||50||We walked over after visiting The Tower of London. Managed to get my kids to try all sorts of new foods. Turkish Delight, Asian Noodles, stinky cheeses. Gets quite crowded after 12pm, so best to get there as early as possible and be willing to eat standing up.||August 8, 2016
Thomas R||40||Very interesting market with abundant choices of foods from all over the world. A lack of seetings makes it a bit of a quest to really enjoy whatever you choose, but you'll find a way.Deffinently worth a visit, while walking the bankside.||August 8, 2016
HRGuruPreston_Lancs||50||We visited this super little market and was very impressed. Lots of choice and exclusive stuff. Will visit again and buy my lunch from one the many different hot food stalls. A great place to take a date for lunch.||August 8, 2016
B00yah2013||50||Get some amazing fruit, fresh produce, smelly cheese, wine or aged parma ham or Jamon. You name it it is here in abundance and in good quality. Best coffee in town at the french cafe Monmouth for an awesome coffee.||August 8, 2016
Mathieulomb||40||One of the best market in London with really good products but too expensive in my opinion. You should wait till the end (around 5-6) to get all cheaper||August 7, 2016
deb0rrahf||50||We visited this place on two occasions. We loved all of the different stalls to try many types of cuisine. London knows how to do food right. Being in the hospitality industry, we highly recommend this place!||August 7, 2016
Craddock23||50||We didn't get here until it was starting to close, but what we saw looked fab! Lots of different food stalls from different countries with something for everyone. We loved finding an old red phone box converted into a cashpoint machine! What a great idea. Next time we visit London we will be sure to go to Borough Market much earlier in the day for a proper look round.||August 7, 2016
lynn b||50||What a magnificent market. I've seen a few around the world but this tops the lot. The quality and range of foods is awesome. Visit to view and enjoy a meal 'on the hoof'. Also take home goodies for the fridge and larder.Don't take a large, young school party- a smaller group of older students would work. If you find crowds and walking tricky, this is not the place for you unfortunately. If you find you just need a moment of peace and rest, pop into Southwark Cathedral café close by- cool, calm and great teas and cakes.||August 7, 2016
cupcake2012_12||50||So my first visit to this market although it was amazing I struggled and changed my mind what I wanted about four times to the annoyance of my husband I ended up with raclette cheese on new potatoes yummmmm! My husband had the pork on a bap it was lovely too. Really impressed with this market. ||August 7, 2016
L5723QOsarap||50||Wow, we just spent a couple of hours on Borough Market. Interesting smells, sounds and sights and every imaginable food available. A real must see.||August 7, 2016
Arnold L||40||I visit Borough Market regularly so think it's just worth noting exactly what you get. Firstly there are a couple of good restaurants here. Applebee's is one of the best fish restaurants around and can be found on the West side of the Marley - book to avoid disappointment or be prepared to queue - it's worth it. There are a number of others. The market itself is during summer and holidays absolutely heaving with people so if crowds and pushing and shoving are not your thing - stay away. However if you can deal with crowds there is a massive selection of street food, market fruits and produce, wine, hams , fresh fish and meat and everything in between. This is largely a produce and food market but fantastic olive oils, spices and wines can be had gift wrapped or otherwise. The market can be accessed from London Bridge Station, by walking from Warterloo - maybe 20 to 30 minutes or by bus from Warterloo or St Pauls. Don't forget on of the most beautiful but smallest cathedrals in the UK is located here - Southwark Catherdral - well worth a look around and opposite th market is the Menier chocolate factory - now a dining place and theatre and well worth a look. Enjoy .||August 7, 2016
Carla K||50||This is a fantastic market! There is anything you can imagine for sale. Make sure to visit when you are hungry-many vendors offer free samples. We purchased a Pimms to sip on while strolling through. It is enormous-I'm sure we were not able to see everything.||August 6, 2016
Gabby R||50||Loved loved LOVED our visit here. Cool produce, tasty food, great atmosphere. Well worth the trip. I will definitely visit again.||August 6, 2016
Suiterkin||50||I've been to many of the 'must go to' food markets around the world and this I think is the best. The quality of the produce is astounding and the range vast.It's like a large farmers market and international food fair rolled into one.I went for a half hour stop off and spent the best part of two days there.Lot's of ready to eat street food and sample handed out by incredibly well informed and enthusiastic producers.Your only regret will be not having three stomachs!||August 6, 2016
wdl||40||A great place to grab something to eat. The food tends to be consistently good across stands. We got supplies for our picnic the next day (on the train) including an assortment of panini, cheese and charcuterie. We had lunch. Of notice, the fish and chips stand is great, and there is a hidden stand for Argentinian empanadas. It is very close to the London bridge tube station so it is easy to get there.And it is very crowded. It may be at times challenging to move around and even more challenge to find any free spot to sit. ||August 6, 2016
dianner435||50||Crowded on a Sat afternoon. Lots of stalls selling prepared food, veggies, fruits, etc. wish I would have gone earlier during our trip. Southwark Cathedral which is next door is worth a visit. Bought a British pie which was delicious. There was a wine shop that looked like the best I've seen in London. ||August 6, 2016
1marshal||30||We went on a Saturday at lunchtime. The market is very crowded and you just go with the flow. The displays are very colourful. Most of the produce is overpriced. Pretty much everything on the stalls is overpriced. You would do well to go in a restaurant and sit down and have a proper meal than stand in a queue and gulp down you meals with folks elbowing you. One visit is enough. ||August 6, 2016
Adam T||50||If you like food this is a must visit, With a variety of food supplies as well as street food ready to eat. The varity is wide and the quality is outstanding.All market stall are happy to discuss their product and it really is a wonderfull experience||August 6, 2016
Richard S||50||Great old school atmosphere and shows off the cultural diversity of our fabulous capital superbly. Loads of different foods and everyone busy but friendly. Must see to soak up the atmosphere!||August 6, 2016
JKM-VA||50||Must do experience for foodies whenyou are in the neighborhood of the Tower of London tube stop (or the Shard). Some of the highlights of the Borough market include: the fresh juice stall, the tea stall (the Chai is a transformative tea experience due to high quality tea, freshly grated ginger juice,and freshly ground black peppar), Monmouth Coffee (order the drip coffee and check out the heaping bowls of the almost fluffy Costa Rican Sugar), the England-only wine bar (try the Three Graces Sparkling Wine), and the spice stall. The market starts a bit late -- most stalls don't open til 9 am (the juice and tea stands are early birds, however) and no stalls are open on Sun.-Mon. ||August 6, 2016
I4025TUpetert||50||If God made markets then he would have made Borough Market.I could sit here and write description after description about the mouthwatering food, smells and drink... But I would not be doing justice to your senses.My favourite time to visit is Christmas. The cheese stalls are to die for and all the Christmas eggnog, mulled wine, beer... I Just wish I could live there! ||August 5, 2016
Absmoggy12||50||Little bit mental and bust with young kids but they loved the hussle and bustle. Plenty of places to choose from to eat. Shame not much seating but was still fab! ||August 5, 2016
Katmk10||50||Love love love borough market it's a must see on your visit to London. Pick up some tasty bits from the stalls and treat yourself to some street food ||August 5, 2016
Harbinder K||40||My favourite market..... Only discovered it last year even though I have been living in London for 26 years.A market full of so many stalls with a variety of stalls......food, drinks, cheese, meat, poultry spices, vegetables,fruits, flowers, restaurants etc. Just love strolling around the market, taking in the ambience and the atmosphere. Yummy doughnuts...... Delicious toasties....juices...... Burgers..... Fish and chips.....Love the Spice stall, colourful fruit and vegetables displays. There is also opportunity to taste the produce.If I lived closer to London Bridge I would visit every week to get my fruits, vegetables and cooking ingredients.||August 5, 2016
carly_smith3||50||We visited Borough market and loved it. I love the atmosphere here it's buzzing. l recommend the duck wraps, so good. Also if you walk around there are people with tasters and you can try them, so make sure you walk around and try before you buy.||August 5, 2016
Luisa T||50||We had lunch there one day and we really enjoyed it. Lots of free samples and amazing food, all kinds of food. I had an amazing venison burger and a delicious smoothing. Also the best Thai coconut pancakes that I've ever had.||August 5, 2016
Altiona H||50||Borough Market is definitely one of the top things to visit in London. I've been there several times (and I will go again) and is a pleasure. Full of people, perfumes, products. Must try the paella, so tasty! Once you're there don't miss the Umbrellas in Vinopolis Piazza, hidden away in a corner of the Market which is nice mostly in sunny weather.||August 5, 2016
Suzanne B||50||We were staying not far from here and liked it so much we popped in every day. Sampled lots of different food and deciding what to have for lunch was difficult but can definitely recommend the Pie Minster stall especially the Moo pie (Steak and ale) and the Freeranger (Chicken ham and leek) with creamy mash and gravey...heaven. Had to buy some to bring home. Also bought fabulous cakes, cookies and italian bread, truly a food lovers delight.||August 5, 2016
JCGFRY||50||Exactly what you wanted, and you did t even realise. Wether you're in hospitality or enjoy good food or are wandering around London this place has it all. If your picking up wholesale ingredients boutique items for are just going for the assault on the senses. Enjoy.Recommend Mons cheese, helpful stall Runner, but most stalls are helpful and up for a chat. ||August 4, 2016
zammy111||50||Borough market is an absolute joy!!! Whether you're a first-class foodie or not... we all have to eat, and I can think of no better food-market, with its location, aromas, choice, sights, colour, flavour, atmosphere and just plain yumminess than the one and only Borough Market. Fan-TAS-tic!||August 4, 2016
778franki||50||This market has so many options, you may find it overwhelming. For me, I was nervous about making a wrong decision because so many were in the running. The quality and diversity of goods is high and you can visit several times and not even see everything.||August 4, 2016
Marta W||50||Really nice place to taste food from different countries , my husband loves oysters and this is the right place he says We will come back. ||August 4, 2016
_teojulie88||50||Been to a few Street open market in London. Borough is more up market and stuffs here are a bit more pricey with better quality. There are fresh products like veg, nuts, organic stuffs, health food, cooked food stalls, juices, all sorts of cheese- lovely ! Dun miss this interesting place ! ||August 4, 2016
william070||50||What a nice place to be. Not far from Tate Modern, excellent for a stroll and a drink.There are good food stalls and restaurants. A must-see!||August 4, 2016
susan33181||50||Burough Market, located near and under the London Bridge is a MUST!!! The market is a mass with foods and products from everywhere; fresh and beautiful produce stands, food vendors selling exotic sandwiches, sausages, noodles, dumplings, etc., restaurants, chocolatiers, gelato makers, bread bakers, spice houses, soap and natural producers, florists, wine merchants and more....It's an experience to love and remember!||August 3, 2016
TanyaTim||50||Completely blown away by the range a quality of produce on offer. Certain that when we move to London we will shop here.||August 3, 2016
Sam R||50||Possibly not the best place to visit with young children as when very busy like today they are prime targets for being whacked by other people's bags, but, great experience, lovely food, amazing choice and interesting for the whole family try new stuff. Definitely visit!!||August 3, 2016
David V||50||Fantastic range of eats and drinks as well as food shopping, fruit, meats, fish, cheeses, chocs, wines etc etc, its really good with a range of prices to suit all tastes and pockets... do not miss it ||August 3, 2016
Rach R||50||Visiting London for me was strolling some great streets, meeting interesting people and trying some of the best food! Borough market gave e all of the above. Being a vegetarian, it is hard to find food anywhere, but I had this delicious Halloumi wrap and enjoyed myself, walked across looking at other stalls and it an absolutely vibrant experience! However, do find out the timings as they are not open on all days. ||August 3, 2016
JPJBrooklynBrit||50||I love Borough Market..it's full of the most gorgeous stalls selling food, flowers, wine etc and lots of cafes and restaurants. Great place to start a walk along the South Bank too.||August 3, 2016
RichardUpshall||40||I had dinner here at Roast, a review exists for that experience. I had not been here before, and it was 10 mins from the Mondrian, and I actually walked right past it whilst doing morning Cardio and didnt even notice it. In the evening though (and I assume lunch too), it is bustling, lively and a great venue for a planned or random night out with lots of bars an eateries to wander around. The more popular ones seem to need booking well in advance, although there do seem to be plenty of options in this area.Black cabs easy to find too, and seemed safe enough, go have a look||August 3, 2016
kennethmG9597LJ||40||We visited the market on the morning of Saturday 30th July and it was very busy. However walking around the numerous food stalls was very enjoyable with so many products from so many countries, it took us a good couple of hours to see most of the booths. Fresh produce was also available and we purchased lots of fruit as well as some huge sausage rolls and specialist Scotch eggs.The weather was also very good which made the visit first class.||August 2, 2016
Susy N||50||Definitely go there with empty stomach ! Food and fresh produce are amazing here. You can even stay for breakfast, lunch and dinner all here, and still won't finish trying all the goodies. From pulled pork ciabatta, focaccia, doughnut, fresh made pasta, paella, coffee, ginger and lemon grass drink, all sort of cakes and sweets, cheese, olives, etc etc the list goes on ! Feeling hungry already ? .... :) Don't forget to explore both sides of the market, because both have amazing stalls. If I live in London, sure I will visit this place EVERY weekend !||August 2, 2016
DoosanBabcock||50||I come here every time I'm in London. Its the perfect place to find an amazing selection of different food and drink. Fish wraps at Applebee's, pork sandwiches at Roast, chorizo in a fresh roll at Brindisi, coffee at Monmouth are just some of the many delights this market has to offer. A must visit for incredible food. Come hungry!||August 2, 2016
RoseBowlTraveler||40||Great Market near London Bridge Station. Fun to walk around and then drift down towards the Thames and walk along the river. Good strolling food as well as food to bring home for later.||August 2, 2016
H1ghSpy||40||This is a place for foodies rather than bargain hunters. There is an extensive range of products for sale from shellfish through beer to cheeses and pickled meats. Many offer samples. There are not many bargains and be warned the place is generally heaving at weekends. For lunches and snacks try the chorizo baguettes from the stall outside Brindisa or Le Pain Quotidien. Neither are cheap but you get good quality flavoursome food. Great coffee can be had from the Monmouth Coffee Company. A place or browse and soak up the vibe ..and possibly treat yourself to something special.||August 2, 2016
Suzanne1066||40||We stumbled in en route to another site and enjoyed looking into all the stalls -- ready to eat and fresh fish. Came back through for lunch -- panini, paella and lemonade!||August 2, 2016
Hannah O||50||The thing I love the most about Borough Market is that you actually forget you're in the busy centre of London for a minute. There are so many stalls offering ready-to-eat food, as well as fresh fish, fruit and vegetables, breads and cheeses.. all finished off with a lovely coffee shop overlooking the whole hall. Even if you aren't going to purchase anything, Borough Market is certainly worth a visit for the smells and sights alone (of course being offered "testers" as you walk around is also a bonus!).I always make an effort to walk through if I'm in the area, and would recommend everybody do the same!||August 2, 2016
JoteePark||50||A really interesting atmospheric market. Food all looked fantastic. Could have spent much longer wandering around. Great easy to find location.||August 1, 2016
Emmumof4||50||This is always a winner for our family when we visit London. Loads of food and drink, brilliant things to look at, not too much walking as it's quite compact. We visited on a full market day on Friday afternoon in the school holidays, it wasn't over busy and there was still loads of stuff to look at and buy. This isn't the sort of market that needs to be visited first thing in the morning. ||August 1, 2016
Progenitor||50||I still dream of the culinary wonders at this market. I have been to a number of great food markets in my time, but this tops them all.||August 1, 2016
Sandy S||50||This is worth a visit if you are in the area. The stalls are amazing. All nationalities and and such a choice! I actually bought huge tomatoes from Brittany, cheese from France and Bolognia, fudge from Cornwall, eggs from a farm in Devon, spices from China and we ate from the street kitchens. I had a paella and there was such a choice. West Indian, German, Chinese, Thai, all over the world!....all so delicious!..eat when you get there! I cannot say it is cheap but what an experience! Some of the stallholders do not have a total grasp of English but they are so much fun and so cheerful! It is a must try!!!||August 1, 2016
FayeInAmsterdam||40||In a short period of time, we went to all of the amazing markets on the weekend. This one is new for me, a great market with lots of food. So we were there for quite some time.||August 1, 2016
961laurieg||50||This is a real experience if you are a food lover. The variety of stalls is an eye opener with food from around the world available and the smells and tastes are such that the time spent is mouth watering. The charcuterie, cheese, meat, bread pastries, spices, oils, wines etc that can be purchased to take away are superb. A not to be missed experience if you are in the area.||August 1, 2016
c9ckl||50||Foodie Heaven, in my humble.A superb mixture of the fresh and the interesting. Bustly Foodie London at it's most vibrant and authentic.||July 31, 2016
HIMSHERO||50||A trip to London is wasted if you do not include this! Located conveniently near the Tube, you can try on different international cuisines here! The market is closed on Sunday.||July 31, 2016
Hydrangea2010||40||It is worth visiting even in short trip to London. You get a nice overview of english food in a interesting location. Saturday morning lines for oyster bar was great to see (too long for a wait though).||July 31, 2016
sukhanm||50||Took my sister in law and boyfriend to the market and they loved it.Lots of stalls of various things from fruit & vegetable, sea food, meat, plants, cheese, bread and lots more. They bought quite a few things and we had lunch there as well. We all had German hot dog and it was delicious.A good 3 hours at the market and went home very happy.||July 31, 2016
lsunnassee||50||Was very good experience, spoilt for choices, the cakes and food are to die for. Go early to avoid crowds and do try some new stuff!||July 30, 2016
Bluehousebysea||50||Caught the end this visit, but still great to absorb the smells and atmosphere. It was too hot for me to buy perishables but will plan better next time to take some goodies home.||July 30, 2016
Johnwpf||50||I've worked nearby for the last six years. The market is better, for me, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays when it is less crowded. There is more choice on Thursdays and Fridays but sometimes the crowds are too much. Don't buy as soon as you get into the market, wander around and look first. If you can't decide a Monmouth coffee, a flat white, gives you time to think. At different times of the year, the 'best buys' vary. I've never been impressed with the sweet stalls, but the cheese, bread, meat, fruit and vegetables are often as good as you can get in any one place in London.||July 30, 2016
Wei_Jie_Koh||30||We became the second victim this afternoon, having discovered our purse was gone near the hot food stalls! The staff in the market told us similar case happened the same morning near the hot food stalls too. The police station near Bourough High Street is not opened during weekend!||July 30, 2016
Overresearched||50||The logical process for visiting Borough Market is to walk around the stalls first. While doing so, take note of what looks interesting. Maybe have a free sample or two. Then, when all the stalls have been carefully examined go back to ones you like and purchase a sane amount of food.I did not do this.I waked, bought, ate. Time and time again. Everything looked good. And, for the most part everything was good. Fresh fruit. A doughnut from Bread Ahead billed as "The world's best doughnut" (it wasn't but still tasty). A roast beef sandwich from Roast-To-Go. A chicken burger from Wyndhams. A cup of prawns.Too much. Too much. And, yet I still had room to stop by Gelateria 3Bis (not in the market but nearby) for gelato. Because, you always have room for gelato.A note on crowds. I arrived at the market at 1:28 PM on a Friday. It was crowded. You can check my photos below to see how crowded. Understand that the crowds are spread out among the various stalls. This does mean that there will be a line for popular stalls. Others might not have a line at all. I never found a place to sit down. So, keep that in mind when buying food.||July 30, 2016
jeffreyd280||40||Grabbed a venison burger (don't remember where) and some BBQ chicken at soul food. Both were delicious but the crowds were crazy on a Saturday afternoon||July 30, 2016
elsa h||40||I had been told that as a foodie that a trip to borough food market wouldn't disappoint and I was proven right! In the quiet borough area there is a lovely atmosphere as everyone is enjoying the amazing selection of food stalls that would satisfy everyone from the biggest meat eaters to vegans!! Lovely coffee stalls as well as an amazing selection of organic fruit and veg, there's also lovely restaurants in the surrounding area if you'd prefer a sit down meal! All I'd recommend is make sure you're hungry!!||July 30, 2016
Lindafromnorwich||50||Gorgeous, fresh produce, in a beautiful busy covered market. Brilliant for people watching, strolling and shopping. Lots of snack/lunch options, with plenty of free samples too. Some seating available as well as clean toilets.||July 30, 2016
Mare170||50||We stumbled upon the markets, jet lagged after a very long flight. The markets were buzzing with local workers who were just knocking off and enjoying beer, wine, oysters and other wonderful fare before heading home etc. We were amazed by the choice and the fresh quality of everything on offer. The locals were friendly and we sat with a group and chatted briefly. The atmosphere was fantastic, we were lucky to be there at that particular time to experience the real London buzz. ||July 30, 2016
Kewalin P||50||We went serval times i love to go there just for oyster! It cheap and so fresh! Must try the clam also it just blow u away! Amazing market and so much choice to choose from ! ||July 29, 2016
HappyHammer69||50||We travelled on the tube to Tower Hill, walked across Tower Bridge, turned right on to the south bank and took a leisurely stroll to Borough Market. We walked passed City Hall, the HMS Belfast and the Hays Galleria. Just before you get to London bridge go left on to Tooley Street and walk under the bridge passed the The Tombs attraction. Follow the road around to the left passed Southwark Cathedral and you'll come to the back of Borough Market.There are many food stalls with a very wide variety of food and the smells are amazing! We had the lamb wrap which was really good. Next time I'll get something from the Ethiopian food stall which had a very long queue but smelled and looked awesome.There are also dessert stalls and my favourite was the baklava and Turkish delight stall, very yummy.Highly recommended destination with plenty of other stalls selling fish, veg, spices and many more food items. Also most of the market is undercover.||July 29, 2016
greatholsAsia||50||Buzzing, vibrant with a fantastic variety. Great quality food stalls, excellent little eateries and the atmosphere is super! A must see if you are in the area, particularly for foodies.||July 28, 2016
70ish||40||I visited Monday and it was much quite than it had been on my previous visit on a Saturday There were not so many stalls open and nowhere near as many people meaning it was easier to walk around and view the stalls (the one selling spices is absolutely amazing) not as atmospheric maybe but still very enjoyable||July 28, 2016
christianw206||40||Lots of foods & specialities - many offers tasting samples. There are also a number of eating places which offer very variated types of food. ||July 28, 2016
Willrude||50||We've been to 3 or 4 other markets in London, but we like this one best. If you're looking for food products, either to bring home, or eat on the spot, this is the place. Very interesting products of all kinds, from cheeses to spices to meats, veggies, etc. etc. When it came time for us to have a bite of lunch; where to go? So many choices. All looking very appealing. We finally chose the only one we could find with seating. Big mistake! It offers mostly some type of burgers with a number of choices of meat. Some of these not so common. Of the 5 of us, we all agreed that we chose the wrong place. Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the place, but you can't miss it. It also has a metal fence surrounding the seating. Other than that, this is THE MARKET.||July 28, 2016
SheelaPi||50||Wow!! this market really made our day. Had just looked it up since we were living at the Shangri-La in the Shard. The market was bustling with activity, lots of locals & tourists. Great choice of fresh farm produce, home-made goodies, food, drinks, fish & fresh cuts, flowers & foods from across the globe. We found baklava, Turkish delight, falafels, Indian pickles & chutneys, spice mix & even Paella. I really think this market needs more marketing to attract tourists. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there eating, drinking, buying things to take back. The little corner with the live cooking class was a nice place to just hang out & relax too. Thank you Borough Market for such a grand experience||July 28, 2016
mpimenta||50||Many different types of food of good quality , very clean and you are always welcome to try everything. One of the best markets I have ever visited. Don't miss it.||July 28, 2016
flochoe||50||Amazing market with great variety of fresh foods, spread of cheeses and other street food. A must-see for foodies!||July 27, 2016
Tess H||50||It's on my commute, Ted's veg is my breakfast bar. This is a perfect spot for locals and tourists alike.||July 27, 2016
rosalies283||50||What a treat to go to Borough. All the beautiful fruits and veg, all the sampling! Yum. We ate venison burger, wild boar sausage, scotch egg, handmade pasta, cheeses, fresh oysters! The kids loved it. ||July 27, 2016
Maryblair04||50||My family came to visit me while I was in London. I made sure I took them here. We spent a good 2-3 hours exploring, tasting, eating, and drinking. It has such a wide variety of food that everyone will be leaving full and happy. Definitely recommend. It is a close walk to the river so after we ate we strolled along and ended up eating (what little we had left) looking at the Tower Bridge. Perfect day.||July 27, 2016
Rafa P||50||Healthy food, you can try fruits, cheese, olive oil and other things before buy! It is possible eat food of other countries ! Drink pins! One of the best markets of London!||July 27, 2016
Demetris2512||50||We visited the market on a Saturday morning and oh my God. I've never been to such a great market in Europe. Just start your walk with a nice cold freshly juice and try the goodies from the shops. Don't miss the shop with the spices and try cheeses and sausages. Heaven||July 27, 2016
Vania C||40||I spent a whole morning there. There are lots of stalls with many things to taste like cheese, bread, a huge variety of olive oils and vinegars. It is amazing and there are great food stalls with international cuisine and also cakes and sweets. A must go for food lovers.||July 27, 2016
ayelensolr||50||Its an amazing place to visit, it can be crowded, be patient. I think is a good idea to go for a walk on the riverside ( in the Tate Modern side of the river), its an interesting place and a different part of London and then stop at the market for lunch.  ||July 27, 2016
schultzey||40||I've been here a handful of times before but my wife never had so took her for a wander round. She loves food and enjoyed wandering around seeing, tasting and then purchasing lunch. The market feels safe and has a great atmosphere. ||July 27, 2016
Rodri T||50||While its location makes this market significantly more famous than the others, it does not mean that Borough Market does not live up to its name. Even when you walk down the stair at the south end of London Bridge, you will immediately be welcomed with a wonderful smell of world spices. So exciting, and sinful for a food lovers! There are also fresh produce, meat and dairy products such as sausage and cheese, and many more!Don't limit yourself with Borough Market though, London has a lot of wonderful markets. Greenwich, Bricklane, Portobello, ....PS: The construction has finished, so don't worry about that. There is significant emptiness though; I don't know if it's because of extra space or because the not all stalls have opened yet.||July 27, 2016
Yellow_Steve||40||After attending an appointment at London Bridge Hospital we walked towards Westminster bridge and past through Borough Market at lunch time, we were amazed at the variety of food available from the stalls from all over the world my wife had a pie with mushy peas my daughter a scotch egg salad and I had hog roast. There were Asian, African and other European dishes available and all were very popular well worth a visit for a snack, a full meal or just to soak up the atmosphere.||July 26, 2016
catmitch62||50||Had lunch at a counter. There were oysters or far simpler fare. Lovely fruit smoothies and stalls for fantastic fruit and veg. A very colourful place. Nice to just wander around and try stuff. Bread stall was gorgeous. We went to rate modern to see the Georgia O'keefe exhibition and back to the market for a drink in the wheatsheaf pub afterwards. Perfect afternoon. ||July 26, 2016
jaydeesox||50||It was really a unique experience. The variety of vendors and ethnicities make this a great attraction for locals and tourists ||July 26, 2016
John H||50||Went on a Monday, which is considered a limited day. Still was blown away by all the awesome food stalls and gourmet shops. Would love to see it on a full scale day (Weds - Sat) when it is operating at 100%. Bring your appetite. Also if you are wanting to build a gourmand picnic basket or box of delicious provisions this would be the place to lead up!||July 26, 2016
caveman2016||50||Made my first visit recently,amazing experience,my companion homed in on the mulled cider! all sorts of food and drink on sale all fresh and very well presented,I was taken with the Indian street food,there is all types of world food available,fresh meat,cheese,and just about anything you could want,interesting part of London,well worth taking the bus there as is so much to see, brilliant!||July 26, 2016
prado_carlos||50||Absolutely amazing, the cheese sandwich stall is amazing, you can be on a queue for a while but totally worth it! It's tasty and you pay £6 for a massive toastie!||July 26, 2016
Hannah K||50||I have been here a few times and it never fails to disappoint. There is a HUGE choice of food from meats to cheese to brownies! I always try something different each time I go. It is busy and full of tourists but if you get there early on a Saturday you'll be absolutely fine. I can't recommend this enough, even to just walk around it's incredible to see and smell everything on offer.||July 26, 2016
Denisa V||50||Just get up, not really awaken and have a coffee there, then have a breakfast and a drink...and have a lunch...still at the same place, close to the river...Loved it!||July 25, 2016
LivebyDesign||50||A definite Must Go to place for the food, the atmosphere... the buzz. I loved everything about it and there is so much variety there that it covers everyone's needs and tastes. You just have to try the mushroom pate, the raw cream, purchase some truffle oil from the greek olive oil stand... oh and the breads, the organic fruit and vegetables, the MUSHROOMS.... ohhhhh all so wonderful. And then there are the bands, the pubs, the people... like I said, everything about the Borough Market is wonderful!||July 25, 2016
Mumof1fromGlenIris||50||A friend suggested the Borough Market, I will sing his praises for years. As a regular visitor to food markets (Prahran, Vic, Dandenong and South Melbourne) in Melbourne we need to lift the bar.The food here was incredibly presented that is both the fresh produce and the cooked goodies that could be enjoyed. There was nothing not to like about this happening little mecca of gastronomy.Its free to look around, not far from the Tower of London and seriously if you like food you need to go.||July 25, 2016
brummywanderer2510||40||Cool market to see, most stands are selling produce but a few sell pastries and drinks for the tourist visitor (who doesn't really have a need for fresh fruits and veggies on their travels!)||July 25, 2016
kmcliverpool||50||Great place to be on a sunny afternoon. So much to look at and the smells are amazing from all the various stores. Lots of choices for a lunch break. Stall holders very friendly and offer samples to taste.||July 25, 2016
livelaughexperience||50||If you love food of any kind, then you must visit this market! As well as stalls there are plenty of restaurants to enjoy wonderful meals. I would have bought a lot here if they day was not so hot and if I was going straight home. I tried the liquorice on the dedicated stall and it was so much better than the dry, shop bought variety!Mountains of cheese, meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic!).If you visit London, you must come here!||July 25, 2016
MBMatt1147||50||Went here a couple times as the first time I arrived too late where shops were closing up. Glad I went back as there is a lot of shops set up and fair bit of food venders so you can have lunch there. Some places take credit card but not all of them, so make sure to bring cash! I did try the Thai food vender, the food was awesome! Also tried some other venders and had really good experiences. A must see for anyone traveling around London!!||July 25, 2016
marcog183||50||It was and is keep to be the best place where to have fresh and seasonal foodAll arround the world ..... and the best place where to go for food to recovered from friday hangover||July 25, 2016
Justine C||50||Borough Market is an absolute must for any visitors to London. It has a massive range of international foods to buy, all excellent quality. You can easily spend a couple of hours browsing, eating and generally soaking up the buzzing atmosphere. We particularly like the Green market area of the market - it has a very relaxed and friendly vibe.||July 25, 2016
christinewT2722SF||50||There is food for everyone here. I'm vegetarian so I though it would be a little difficult to find food. However, there were at least three vegetarian/vegan stalls together so it was actually very easy. The food also seemed to be decently priced. The only downside is being able to find a place to sit. There aren't many areas, at least that I found. There are also stalls selling bread, spices, plants, and so much more. This market has been around for a very long time and it's still a great place to get food. Even if you don't buy something you can look at all the different things that are being sold.||July 25, 2016
rickyspa1||40||As always visiting the Borough market is a very good experience, the number of stalls with different cuisines is amazing, the quality and quantity of high quality food is great and there is so much to see, try and drink. My only but is that certainly you pay over the odds for almost everything, but I suppose it is worthy||July 25, 2016
sccanuck7||50||Upscale market. Lots of places to eat and drink in and around the market as well as to purchase vegetables, fish, meat, mushrooms, bread etc. Very close to London Bridge tube station. You can feel and see the buzz of London street life on a sunny Saturday afternoon.||July 25, 2016
MikeD934||50||Still an amazing food market, this has grown over the years and now sell virtually anything you could ever need. Always busy, there are dozens of stalls selling a vast array of unusual food items. A must-visit place in London. ||July 24, 2016
jacquelineAnneHubbar||50||Stumbled upon this market , Fantastic atmosphere underneath the arches , lovely to walk around amazing smells and food .||July 24, 2016
Hugo W||40||I was on my way to Southwark Cathedral when I stumbled upon the Borough Food Market by chance, as it is right outside the Cathedral. I was very impressed by the large number of different stalls, selling cooked and fresh food from all over the world. Although not really hungry, I tried a German Bratwurst whilst my wife tried some Thai Coconut cakes, both of which were delicious. If only I had some more time [and a greater appetite....]. I will be back in due time!||July 24, 2016
lozza w||40||Looking round, theres an incredible diverse range of good quality food on offer, its certainly an interesting market packed with food concious people, dont expect a street market though, its just mostly for buying groceries like raw meat and fruit.||July 24, 2016
rr177||40||The Borough Market is in a covered building/area. It has many cheese, olive oil, and small restaurants. It was interesting to walk through on a rainy day.||July 24, 2016
Claudia S||50||Borough Market was my favorite bankside place to find lunch. I became a little addicted to Mudlarking, so I was often near the River Thames. I had a favorite Pad Thai place that made my noodles JUST the way I like them! ||July 24, 2016
timbertoby||40||We stumbled upon Borough Markets whilst walking (should I say, meandering) along the banks of the Thames. What an explosion of food smells & sights. We were there on a Sunday at lunchtime & it was particularly busy however worth the extra effort to to walk through the crowd.Will definitely re-visit.||July 24, 2016
simon c||50||Go to Borough Market hungry and thirsty and come away FULL UP! So so many stalls selling all kinds of food & drink..so hard to make your mind up but in the end went for the rather large 'Venison Burger'. Fantastic choice and very filling. The trouble is as you wander around you see yet more & more wonderful food that you just wanna taste. I think i need to re-visit time & time again so i can eat my way through each stall lol..ps: the cider stall was a particular favourite :)This market is a definate to visit if you love your food.||July 24, 2016
W9541USlisar||40||This market is one of the best I have visited. I have travelled to many European cities and like to visit the market as I am a foodie, this delightful place is a treat for the senses and matches many of those abroad. ||July 24, 2016
559martynj||50||If you're in London do your best to visit. It's an amazing space with so many speciality food stalls. All laid out beautifully ready to catch your attention. Pick up some artisan bread, some cheese and fruit and eat it on the banks of the river a few steps away. Not only does it work out cheaper for a family but, on a sunny day with amazing food - what could be better?||July 23, 2016
ErinMcGivney||40||Borough Market is an amazing food market, with delicious options from all over the world. I could spend hours there, just exploring and taste testing my way through it :)||July 23, 2016
JeffG356||50||Wide variety of food. Cheese, fresh vegetables, breads, food trucks, desserts, on and on. Many unusual varieties from many countries. Go on an empty stomach. Liked the cheeses, various honeys, and French desserts. However the cider drinks from the barrel were the worst of the visit, and tasted like it had turned. We would have gone back for more but it was closed on Sunday.||July 23, 2016

Ladies at the croatia place had loads of stories. Where else can you give yourself the excuse to drink pink prosecco that early! The tea man tried to convice me to drink tea||July 23, 2016
suzzanne333||50||Amazing place ... Loads of yummy foods to try before buy !! Loads of vegetarian and vegan .. Plus animal flesh. Sociable ... The old London .||July 23, 2016
828darnesha||50||This place is filled with exciting things to eat and drink. I was like a kid in a candy story. You can get jams, cheese, sandwiches, candy, hot food, or cold food. The people at each station are nice and are willing to answer questions. I tried the Malaysian curry chicken and fruit juice (not together) and it was delicious. If you are in the area go check this place out. ||July 23, 2016
Bunjack||40||A large market with a massive range of foods from around the world - not many places to sit but if you are happy to wander and nibble it a feast for the taste buds! can get busy but be patient it's worth the hassle||July 23, 2016
therewasanoldlady||50||The market is pretty central - we visited on our way somewhere else but ended up spending more time at the market. The colours and smells were wonderful reminding us of some of the french markets weve visited especially if you like fresh fruit cheese bread fish etc. There are loads of shops and places to eat very close by like the golden hynde great for children and the cathedral. It was busy when we were there buyt still loads to buy not many queues and space to move round in.||July 22, 2016
RichF81||40||Friends brought us here. Wandering around and sampling anything and everything was pure joy. Food stalls galore. You can eat to your hearts content or make it a take away for later. From chocolates to cheeses, meats, produce,candies and desserts, Borough Market has it all. And they have been doing it for hundreds of years! Any trip to London should include a visit.||July 22, 2016
Michael S||30||Compared to other like markets in San Francisco, Seattle, Paris, and Vancouver, the Borough Market was a disappointment. We had been led to believe it might be the best in the world. No way.||July 22, 2016
MargotTR||50||Very nice market, great food and a beautiful location. Everything from olives to craft beer can be found here. Hard to find a place to sit and eat though.||July 22, 2016
karyns702||40||We went to stroll a bit and were pleasantly surprised that both our girls, 9 and 11, enjoyed themselves a great deal. We went hungry and bought various items to share as lunch. If only we had a larger kitchen in our flat in London we would have bought food for later as well.||July 22, 2016
Emma R||50||We went up to Borough market and spent a very happy afternoon wandering around the stalls. Bought some fantastic cheese, cheesecake and bread. Very friendly - will go back soon!||July 22, 2016
catherinebA8556MC||40||Made a quick stop into this market as our Harry Potter walking tour met near here. Very cool market-- very busy with lots of people and be ready to eat standing up but it did the job-- we found grilled chicken and pesto sandwiches /pulled pork sandwiches and nearby bought cookies and brownies!Just be prepared for the crowded feeling. ||July 22, 2016
Amanda M||50||A landmark in London inner city provides fabulous market with such diversity it would take you hours to explore. The provision of foods; cheeses, breads, meats and olives to varieties of wines and beers with eating places all offering a different taste sensation. Fabulous experience and one not to be missed.||July 22, 2016
Jewels1958||50||If you are visiting London this is a must see. A wonderful experience of a vibrant market with the most amazing produce ||July 21, 2016
213LAX||50||Any trip to London I've had has revolved around ensuring that I am there on a Saturday morning so that I can stop by the Borough Market. It is a foodie dream with all the food vendors spilling out over the market. Grilled cheese, cheese, chocolates, Turkish candy, baked goods, fruit... It's hard to make decisions!||July 21, 2016
kerrancep||50||I love wandering around this market - trying all the samples and admiring all the beautiful produce and struggling to decide what to eat for lunch! This time I had the saltbeef on rye which was absolutely fantastic and so huge I could only eat half . You must go !||July 21, 2016
cmarieat||50||The Borough Market is a must visit, while visiting London! There's lots of great food to sample...a little something for everyone. ||July 21, 2016
Lyn R||40||The wonderful Borough Market is situated just a stone's throw from London Bridge station.There is so much to choose from...whether you fancy a sweet treat like fudge or the popular seafood, scotch egg, or Indian street food stall there's something for every foodie to enjoy!Prices can be dear but don't be shy to try a sample as you make your way round the Market!||July 20, 2016
FoodieAdvice||50||An amazing market with a plethora of vendors. A must see (and eat)! Hash's Louisiana style pulled pork sandwich with cheese sauce, kimchi, and slaw was delicious. Other vendors there sell bourek (very good we tried the spinach), crocodile, ostrich and zebra meatballs, proscuitto di parma with fresh mozarella and tomato sandwich and more. You can find any type of food you desire. All delicious, a great place to walk around and of course, eat. One of if not my favorite place to visit in London.||July 20, 2016
StockportPuli||40||We met our daughter and her boyfriend for lunch in Borough market last Saturday. We had a brilliant time. They had travelled from Barcelona and we travelled from Manchester. We met in the Wheatsheaf and sampled the local beer brewed on the premises which was exceptional. The choice of food in the market was amazing. We settled for the fish restaurant and my soft shell crab burger was phenomenal. We will visit again.||July 20, 2016
Lyndy3187||40||What a great find, the food here was sensational and fresh. Terrific place to come with a local or as a traveller wanting some fresh food. Cheaper too.||July 20, 2016
ThomReynolds||50||Had a great walk round here tasting all the freebies and sniffing the great smells of cooking street food. So much variety you will definitely something that appeals. Great to do if you have some spare time. A lot of the local restaurants offer the foods from the market too. ||July 20, 2016
roseanne000||40||Lots of nice food and drinks stalls here with a gourmet quality but on a decent budget. This is also a nice place to just walk around, and you can most likely get a few samples if you do this too! ||July 20, 2016
dabella2015||50||We lovedddd this place, full of people and different types of food, cooked and also vegetables and cheese and so much more! Go hungry and stop at a few places there. We tried the fish and chips first and we went from there. There is bathrooms inside. ||July 20, 2016
PeterC168662||40||if you are in London, and want to eat something different and casually, then i recommend this place....not cheap but it has lot stalls and so a lot of choices.....we found the scotch egg it was fantastic.....the cocnut tarts were interesting!!Good luck....look round before you decide, dont just choose the first one you see, because it looks good....look around and you will find something fantatsic!!!||July 20, 2016
Sjc997||50||Borough market is a must visit on an empty stomach... Wonder round eat some food, have some drinks and sample some amazing produce!||July 20, 2016
53natashag||40||Borough market is a great place to visit there are so many food choices and you can also pick up a cheeky glass of pimms or prosecco on the way round whilst you make your choice. It's very laid back so not many places to sit and eat but I recommend popping round to the beautiful church and taking your food onto the grass area there. Salt beef sandwiches are great so are the barbeque sandwiches on the corner, and the guys who serve you are true gents with loads of character and smiles||July 20, 2016
iloveholidays077||40||Ended up here after visiting Tower of London. Not so busy when I got there at 11.45 but it wasn't too long until it was! Fantastic selection of food but struggled to find somewhere to buy water? As it was busy seating eas not available so I went and sat in the garden of the cathedral next door to eat. Lovely spot but do wonder if it is now a tourist trap.||July 20, 2016
L5622RPsandrag||40||Been here a few times, very expensive prices, but a lovely atmosphere, and in a lovely position. Makes a nice change to see a market in central London ||July 20, 2016
gsbc77||50||I love visiting here, it's great seeing the wide range of different foods on offer. But my absolute favourites are bread ahead (for doughnuts unlike you have ever tasted before), Boston sausage (best sausages you will ever taste) and la tua pasta! I've been both on full market day and when there is a limited market, still a large selection of stalls open on the limited day and much much less busy! ||July 19, 2016
VWCalgary||50||We passed by this market late one night while going to Tate Modern and we managed to buy some dessert and they were yummy. So we decided to go back the next day. This market didn't disappoint us. This market has a lot of stands selling vegetables, fruits,cheeses, sausages, flowers and best of all a lot of food stands that sell a variety of ethnic food and of course seafood. There are also a few coffee houses. All the fruit and vegetables are fresh and the food at the food stands tempting. Last but not least a few stands sell desserts, breads, croissants. This will be a market to visit especially when you are hungry.||July 19, 2016
Ken H||50||This Market was spectacular, I went there a couple of days on a one week trip. It is a good place just to go get lunch with an amazing variety of options. I would absolutely go back when in London.||July 18, 2016
katysdaddy||50||A real paradise for food lovers, lots of artisan producers and sellers of all types of fresh food, great choice and great quality ||July 18, 2016
TripperEmma67||30||I trained and worked at Guy's Hospital from 1991-1998 and this market was a very simple yet productive place to visit and have a drink in the Market Porter. I could not wait to return as heard so much over the years…It was a Friday, and July however the whole area to navigate around was unpleasant and very limited with seating areas to enjoy a food purchased from the many hot food stalls, as such I didn't buy any as hate to stand/walk and eat.There were a variety of vendors from Bread/pastries/cakes, cheeses, olives, truffles, charcuterie, liquorice, fudge…I could go on and on.I did find it a little bit 'samey' and would probably visit for an hour or so again but having envisaged needing a full half or whole day to savour and then no seating to enjoy. I paid £6.50 to have a coffee and a scone in a cafe where I was told I had to purchase a cake as well…(this did not make me happy).It's a little too commercialised and products very over priced.||July 18, 2016
Beverley W||40||This has expanded since I last visited. So many new eateries in addition to the stalls selling produce to take home. Definitely worth a look if you are in the area.||July 18, 2016
Alexandra G||50||This is a great market for finding specialty foods and grabbing a bite to eat. There is something for everybody here, and I don't even know where to start for recommendations. Best bet is to get there and just wander through until something catches your eye! ||July 18, 2016
londoner-reviews||50||Unfortunately there is only one such market in London, but boy am I glad that we have it. It is a real assault for the senses and I defy anyone not to be impressed with the vast array of sights, smells and sounds. From grilled cheese sandwiches, Thai food, Spanish jamon, to warmelon smoothies, sourdough bread and beyond... come hungry and you won't regret it.The full market operates on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. I recommend coming on Wednesday or Thursday lunchtime to avoid the insane rush of tourists.||July 18, 2016
Honorius42||40||This is a food and drink market, there may be a few (very few) stall selling other things but even then it is plates and things that revolve arround food. It was easier to reach getting off the tube at london bridge then bourough and walking down. I went at lunch time on a very hot and sunny saturday so yes i did expect it to be busy and it was. There was a vestibule area with seating in if for people which was full in contrast to the large alfresco areas marked out for the surrounding resturants which were empty. There was a large variety of differnt cuisines avalible but there were more then a few stalls that seemed to be exact duplicates of eachother spread through the market. I also noticed the prices vairied rather massivly between each stall, the apple juce for example was £2:50 at one stall but arround the corner was £3:50 which made me rather weary about buying anything as I looked arround and becase of how busy it was i ended up deciding not to go back for the stuff i saw and bought from the out skirts instead as there seemed to be a handy road encircling the market allowing fast movement arround it.For what i did buy~ "whirled" fudgeThe rum and raison was delicious the salted caramel wasnt to my taste but others liked it well enough the cidre fudge was alright but nothing impressive.~ Apple juiceI don't remember the stall name for this but thay had a lot of differnt fresh juces, 7/8 differnt types of apple juice not bus the standered apple and blackcurrant but diffenrt juices from differnt varietys of apples. It was chilled the cups being kept in broken ice (which was the reason i bought from them) which was just what i wanted on a hot day.~ "Pieminister"Deer Stalker pie, mash and peas. Venison bacon red wine and lental pie, nice crisp pastry well filled pie though it was a little short on the meat inside of it. The potatoes were hot mashed potato a little bit lumpy but delicious non the less. The peas were supposed to be minted which i couldnt taste and they also seemed hard.~coconut pancakesI go back and forth on this one. It was a crisp bottem filled with what i can only compare to semolina that tasted like coconut they were a nice meld of sweet and savory but the texture was stright from school dinner.All in all it was an enjoyable trip but not the market to go to if you want anything other then food or somewhere to sit.||July 18, 2016
Beth L||50||Such a nice place to walk to. Every time i go to london this is the first place i have to go because it is so multi cultural. I get compte cheese 32 yr old and its gorgeous. There are lots of things to try||July 18, 2016
william-the-hobbit||40||Walked to Borough Market before we headed to Tate Modern Museum for our lunch, and although the prices are a rather steep for market food, you can get some bites at a good price. Tried the duck confit with brioche, and it was tasty!||July 18, 2016
hope b||20||Decent food but not for food travellers. As Greeks we have very high standards about food so we expected more from this outdoor market. If you are passing by you may find a variety of different ingredients and different styles of cooking, give it a try.||July 18, 2016
Shazz1984||50||If you are in London you have to go here. The place is buzzing full of people and stalls selling some of the best food and produce in London. It's well worth a visit.||July 17, 2016
WMIM||40||We walked through here on a Monday in mid-afternoon on the way from London Bridge Station to Tate Modern and I was surprised at how many food stalls were in evidence as I thought this market was mainly an end of week affair. Most of the permanent stalls in the more wholesale part appeared to not be open, though.I have been here many times and have reviewed this market before. If you arrive at it by descending the steps near the south west end of London Bridge I defy you to be anything less than sorely tempted by the hot food on display at the establishments immediately to the left at the bottom of the steps.There are plenty of other attractions at or near this Thames-side area including The Shard, the Old Operating Theatre, Clink Prison Museum, Shakespeare's Globe and Tate Modern. A whole day could easily be spent at this part of the riverside between London and Blackfriars Bridges.||July 17, 2016
Snot_Finder||50||We explored the market on a Monday at lunch. It was raining but that didn't affect us too much. Our kids still talk about it. There was food from all over the world and we each had something very different - paella, meat pie, bratwurst, and a lamb wrap. Several dessert and sweets stalls and surrounding shops. Would be high on our list of we happen to be in London again.||July 17, 2016
ceggie||50||A really fun place with a lively atmosphere. So many vendors and so much too choose from that everyone will be happy. Lots and lots of people, and not many places to sit. A must see for anyone visiting London.||July 17, 2016
Martin2206||40||This has an eclektic mix of food offerings conveniently located by Southwark Cathedral. Be warned though arriving at lunch time is best avoided because the crowds make it uncomfortable to wander around. A later afternoon walk gives you a bit more freedom to enjoy the sights and smells of wonderful market offerings||July 17, 2016
rockydotdom||50||On a warm, sunny summer's day, the Borough Market was a delight. Almost entirely made up of high end and bespoke food producers, the market is a real treat for serious foodies, The delights of the English summer garden were on display, along with high end butchers, fishmongers, bakers, wine merchants and flower sellers. There is some excellent food stalls at which to buy your lunch or a snack. We incorporated our visit as part of a lovely walk from Tower Bridge Tube across the river, on to the Globe and the Tate and then back across the Millennium Bridge to St Paul's. It's a great walk on a nice day, and the Borough Markets, at half way, is the perfect stop for lunch.||July 16, 2016
Molly600||50||This market gets very busy but there is a great atmosphere and a wide choice of food if you want to eat there. Its nice that its not become something very corporate and antiseptic like a lot of London has.||July 16, 2016
familyonhols1985||40||It's all here. Places to sit people watch, eat & drink. Wide variety of food from a number of stalls. Large crowds with most more interested in taking selfies||July 16, 2016
Ann B||50||The place to visit to soak up the atmosphere of a London food market. Pork pies and black pudding scotch eggs are amazing, Lots of fresh produce, wines, and beers to tempt you.||July 16, 2016
Mla35||50||What a wonderful surprise! As part of a tour, we were taken to the Borough Market. It was amazing, It had everything you could possibly want. We enjoyed fresh cheese, juice, olive oil, sandwiches and even tried some alligator meat. It was all fresh and beautifully displayed. There is something for everyone!||July 16, 2016
jemflower||40||What's not to like? A day out on its own with food! I always take friends visiting London to Borough Market and we always end up waddling back home. Too many favourite stalls to recommend just one but pretty much any bread and cheese stall you hit is heaven.||July 16, 2016
Timsuv||20||Nothing wrong with Borough Market though if you've been to any town in France or Spain you will realise that this is pretty low key by comparison.What I'm surprised at it how much hype there was around Bastille Day when what they actually had was...a handful of French stalls with nice cheese and pancakes. You have to admire London's ability to promote even the most average of pastimes and this one topped the list of style over content. I felt sorry for the dozens of French people we noticed walking towards the market in anticipation as we walked away after 10 minutes...bored.||July 15, 2016
cabbagegreen||40||Food is displayed attractively, friendly and helpful stallholders; the mass of people (including families with toddlers and buggies on a Saturday, inexplicably) makes it impossible to move from about 1pm. The ongoing building works combined with crowds and a lack of seating makes it *challenging* if you have mobility issues, but get there earlier and it's fascinating to see, choose and plan meals with more unusual ingredients that are generally much cheaper than you'd find in supermarkets - if you can find them at all. And the Bramley & Gage samples are wonderful!||July 15, 2016
Ashley-Smile4||40||This is a great place for a variety of food! Food from all different parts of the world! I wanted to try so much. The location is clean & surprisingly it wasn't crowded. I enjoyed walking around looking at the items being sold. I recommend this for an easy day.||July 15, 2016
sandrachandra2000||40||Our first trip here "brilliant".We got off at the Borough tube station however the London bridge station is nearer. The place is full of little stalls exhibiting their delicacies of Cheeses,cured meats,oils,breads,sweets and much from all over the world. Make sure you are hungry as they dish out free little tasters for you to try. unfortunately it was a Sunday and some of the stalls were closed and we were disappointed that the fresh goat meat and a very few other shops that were not open. We were so impressed that we are going back in a couple of weeks time on a weekday.||July 15, 2016
Oksana H||50||My husband and I went here for lunch. We bought one of a couple things and split everything. It's amazing street food from all over the world. The food was extremely fairly priced. ||July 15, 2016
152michaelj||50||From fresh food to lunch it has everything.All fresh and from everywhere and there is almost everything you could think of.Make sure you go and give yourself a few hours and be hungry.||July 14, 2016
leanne F||50||My hubby and i were exploring london and came across the Borough markets. It had so much different foods you could buy from meats, cheeses, sea food and cooked food also for lunch. Its very busy but great for just takjng time out to enjoy. ||July 14, 2016
oilili2012||50||Frankly, you would expect such a market in France but in London?! It's a must see. A delight for the eyes and for the stomach. You need a good couple of hours to stroll around, to buy if you can, and a little more time if you are planning to grab something to eat. Don't miss the Neal's yard cheese place. Make it in the morning before 11am, if you can, especially if coming with kids.||July 14, 2016
Kathie W||50||We came across Borough Market on our way to the Globe this week. We had already eaten unfortunately but we will be back on our next visit. And we will make sure we are starving ! Every corner we turned we found absolutely delicious food.||July 14, 2016
Bubblechucks||50||MIz Bubblechucks discovered Borough Market in 2000, and has been going there ever since to buy all manner of things: cheese, charcuterie, fruit, flowers, meat, poultry, game, fish, cakes, sweets, honey, and bread. My trip today included a detour to buy some ice-cream on a hot afternoon. The Greedy Goat ice-cream stall sells a number of flavours of ices made out of goats' milk. My favourite flavour is raspberry with chilli. Today, I tried apple pie. It was delicious - spicy and appley. Just perfect, and cooling.||July 14, 2016
noeleenf||50||Fabulous place full of food stalls to purchase various foods some to take home and some to eat on the go. There is a great little wine bar which serves English wines, you can buy food from the market then eat it in the wine bar along with a glass of wine that you purchase. Absolutely loved this place. You can purchase anything from cheese to plants to fruit to spices to fudge/chocolate to biscuits/cakes. Plus lots of street food to eat there and then. Pieminster sells fabulous pies available with peas and gravy which went down well with a lovely medium white wine eaten out in the open.||July 14, 2016
Travelmonster2011||50||We went to Borough market in July , in our family vacation we decided to stop at borough market , as we always do when we travel if you visit a new country visit local markets and get to know better the city.Is a great fusion of aromas , food and spices as soon you walk in , Persian , Mediterranean , local and from everywhere food.My wife try a pad Thai and I try a paella , both were rich in flavor .Definitely is a mandatory stop while you in London.||July 14, 2016
HenryMA-A||30||Busy open air market with some tasty smelling foods from the likes of Germany and Egypt to name a few.Cakes, cheeses and fruits are available here.Good for tourists and lunch times for local employees.Well worth a try especially since it is in close proximity to The Shard, London Bridge & Southwark Cathedral as well as nice tropical garden seating area (popular with flying wildlife) with a seating and toilet area.||July 14, 2016
Rhi_Rhi_Travel||50||We ate in various places, including wokit. I have never had such amazing noodles, the service was amazing and super fast! All so friendly and welcoming. We found strawberries locally grown in a little market, some absolutely amazing things. We very nearly never went to borough market, time was not on our side. We decided we'd go and miss something else out. I'm so pleased we decided to go here. It was amazing, I will be back! ||July 14, 2016
EdUnloaded||50||If u love food, this is the place to go! Lots of great food to try for to yourselves. Some stalls also give out free samples, so u can try what u are ordering. A must go place, everytime when we go back to London. Even the chefs from our hotel go there to buy produce, as the stuff here is really fresh. ||July 13, 2016
O9043ZQemilyb||50||went to borough market for lunch with friends and we instantly fell in love with it! So many amazing options to choose from and everything we ate was excellent! Definitely recommend the lamb wrap stall! The cheesecake was excellent was well. ||July 13, 2016
Ben and Sanja R||50||If you are walking down the Southbank from London Eye towards Tower Bridge, have a break at Borough Market and enjoy some great food! You can choose from British pies, Indian curries, falafels, Thai dishes, Egyptian coshari... make sure you leave some space for the desert! Delicious!||July 13, 2016
LiPiMiami||50||This market it's a must, if your really love to experience ethnic, flavorful, inexpensive food and treats. They offer from cheese, ham, prosciutto, olive oil, vinegars, and all sort of spices, as well as prepared food from all over the world. ||July 13, 2016
Michelle B||40||Despite the crowds, this place has a fantastic, relaxed and friendly vibe, with an array of tantalising scents. There is so many amazing things to chose from and as a foodie, it is fantastic to eat your way through. I worked through Thai Coconut pancakes, oysters, chocolate and finally stopping somewhere for lunch. There are stalls that sell alcoholic drinks to walk around with, or to bottle up. Drinks of note are Pimms, Sangria, Mead, Ale, Beer, fizz. Tip: although some stalls accept card payment, bring lots of cash. It is not a cheap market but everything is good and wholesome.||July 13, 2016
arnieabby||50||This is probably my favourite place in London! Amazing food stands covering everything you could ever want including the weird and wonderful. Lovely street food is offered too and nice beer and ciders. Visit, you'll love it!||July 13, 2016
Ameeta A||40||I could spend all day here, and return the next day. Loved the food and beverages on display, picked up some amazing cheese. Ate, ate and ate. ||July 13, 2016
Namita S||50||This market was he absolute best in London. We went there around 9am, just as the shops were setting up & were welcomed with smiles and the most delightful aroma of freshly baked breads & seasonal fruits. Borough market sells all kinds of food & is often very crowded. Go here if you want to eat some wonderful food and a good price & if you want to buy some very special things to take back.||July 13, 2016
Scott8446||40||Good place for a stroll and a look around. Lots of choice of places to eat and easy to get to on the tube or the bus. Still a good place to go later in the evening and walk on the embankment. ||July 13, 2016
bryanetiq||50||1. Go there on an empty stomach. It's a food heaven, and if you love eating in general you will not be disappointed when you get to try the huge selection of food. My recommendation is to try the salt beef (not the store along the streets but the store under the bridge). Don't waste your time or money on the fish and chips there.2. Some stores have samples, try them to taste more food! 3. If you like coffee, try the coffee at Monmouth Coffee, its quite good. 4. It can get quite crowded so don't lose your kids if you're bringing them along.||July 13, 2016
LadyC1961||50||first visit here, lots of great food stalls to eat and also to purchase food items, lots going on, full of colour. A really interesting packs to go for a bite and buy goods to take home with you.||July 13, 2016
Jenny G||50||Definitely a must see place! It's over-crowded, but this only gives a plus to the experience. It's a real, lovely English market with a variety of goods of every kind||July 12, 2016
Maxon2511||50||After watching the "changing of the guards" at Buckingham Palace, we've decided to walk and have lunch at this place. After numerous stops along the way, we finally made it at Borough Market and the choices are overwhelming. I've decided to go for an English classic, fish and chips. Enjoyed them while standing and trying some food the others were having.||July 12, 2016
Karen R||50||This is a busy market (that's mostly under cover) right by London Bridge. It's our favourite place for great food treats & the smells of the street food are amazing.Our highlights:Bread Ahead - sourdough bread is to die for & there are no words to describe their doughnuts, they are the best EVER!Portugese custard tarts - yumCheeses - heaven!Coffee beans to grind ourselves at homeTurkish delight - so many gorgeous flavoursChocolatesCakesAmazing choices & range of the fruit & vegBrindisi - spanish foodOlivesThe street food is fabulous - so much choice and never had anything poor yet. Veggie, meat, sandwiches, pies, burgers - you name it, we've had it and it's all been delicious. We will definitely be back again (and again!)||July 12, 2016
retiree55||50||One must definitely make time to visit the Borough Market while in London. . The market is made up of open stalls and shops. There is everything from fishmongers, meat stalls, fruit and vegetables to olive oils and olives and truffles and mushrooms and bakeries etc etc etc There are also quirky shops to visit as well. Plan on having something to eat here. So much to choose from pasties, pies, Asian food, Egyptian food, German Bratwurst, curries, Indian etc etc etc. Everything is made fresh to order and oh so delicious. Free samples are to be had at most stalls. My favorite were the pies especially the beef and Stilton. We enjoyed goat ice cream ...yes ...goat ice cream : rum and raisin flavour which was so rich and creamy and smooth. Finishing touch was a real sugar donut filled with vanilla pastry cream....to die for. If purchasing food from stalls does not appeal to you then there are many sit down cafes and restaurants from which to enjoy a meal. Put Borough Market on your list of things to see and do. You will not be disappointed. I assure you.||July 12, 2016
MJZielinski||10||I have lived in London for years. I love Borough Market. However on my visit with my niece this past weekend I refused to consume anything prepared or served on the premises. I have accepted over the years that London markets have a certain amount of charming bacteria but this was beyond disgusting. I hope they clean things up before people start getting ill.||July 12, 2016
Marie M||50||First visit& it was great,loads of lovely tempting food& the smells were amazing.Had a lovely paella lunch with Pimms,great value.||July 11, 2016
juppy||50||We thought we would have a quick wander pasted on a Sunday expecting lots to be shut. How lucky were we Bastille Day celebrations in Market so everything was open. Great atmosphere could eat and drink most things well worth a visit just a great all round pace to go.||July 11, 2016
Z886ZSheatherh||50||I'm a big fan of open-air marketplaces and Borough Market is one of the best. We snagged lunch (fish and chips for him, a steak pie for him) and enjoyed perusing all of the stalls. You could eat here for a week and never be bored. It's well worth a stop when visiting London.||July 11, 2016
Mhgretsch||50||Borough Market is a veritable feast for the senses...and a feast for the tummy! Almost any type of cuisine can be found, so everyone will leave happy. Our group enjoyed fresh hummus & pita bread, hot out of the fryer fish & chips, brat & sauerkraut, and several lovely sweets. We also left with fresh & dried fruits, a lovely soft sheeps milk cheese, fresh baked sourdough bread, a few spice mixes, and a variety of macarons. Wish we had time to go back again before we leave town!||July 11, 2016
tdanielr||50||We stayed walking distance to this market and went almost every day. Great place for food to eat for lunch or dinner and lots of bread, fruits, cheeses, truffle oil, etc. to take with you. Full market days are only Wednesday-Saturday and its closed on Sunday. More limited on Monday and Tuesday but still worth a visit.||July 11, 2016
emiliagerard||50||We live near borough markets and I never get bored of going there. Love the variety of food, cooked and raw that you can get here. Fresh fruit and veges and love the spices - such a huge range.||July 11, 2016
Skiveez||50||Right at London Bridge stop on the jubilee line, it was very easy to get here. Borough has less of a "flew market" feel and also less of the artisanal ambience of the Camden Lock. It's also much less crowded. Count on fewer shops and less selection, but fewer crowds and easier access. The food was amazing. We found some Italian, some Malaysian curry (amazing), and Argentinian empanadas. Hard to find anywhere to sit, so plan on eating while standing. We left the market completely stuffed.Would come back again to taste even more. ||July 11, 2016
391philc||50||You're literally spoilt for choice. Might be best avoided at peak lunch time, very busy and a few long queues (should be a good sign). We went 1ish on a Friday, had a look around, went to a nearby pub and came back hungry. All the food looked good and is of course freshly cooked. As another reviewer said; go to it hungry!||July 11, 2016
CCSUK||50||Only briefly visited the market as we had someone booked later in the day. The market is huge with a fantastic selection of international foods. A few demonstrations was going on as we was there and prices for the food was actually very reasonably priced. Anyone visiting nearby should 100% check this out.||July 11, 2016
trufflehunter78||40||A foodie heaven with a delight at every corner . The choices and standard of the food and beverages are excellent in the market, if your a foodie you will absolutely adore this place for this I cannot fault it the only issue I had with some traders was they was not very friendly or happy to be there, which when you have a fantastic product it is nice to be enthusiastic and welcoming to future customers but on the whole a thoroughly enjoyable experience. ||July 11, 2016
Sally123B||50||Been here quite a few times over the years - its amazing now - a foodie heaven. However I called in a few weeks ago on a Monday @ 5pm and it only has a limited market on Mondays + Tuesdays and has closed by 5pm (Friday 6pm). So I'd suggest check the times the market is open - so you're not disappointed!||July 10, 2016
577SusanH||50||We visited here on a Tuesday when there is only a partial market. It was still really great! I wish our timing had been different and we could have seen the full market, but still if you are a foodie, and enjoy different foods, it is worth a visit any day of the week. Maybe next visit I will get to experience the full deal!||July 10, 2016
ejcunninghame||50||Been here several times before. Always worth a visit. Every kind of food available to eat while there or take home. Great atmosphere and next to the stunning Southwark cathedral. ||July 10, 2016
Vicki B||40||We mooched along on a Saturday afternoon and our senses were assaulted with the divine smell of freshly cooked foods and beautiful fresh produce and plants. We stopped off at a lovely English wine stall and sampled the goods in the afternoon sunshine..... Wonderful ||July 10, 2016
suzabella60||50||This is a fabulous food market, covered, so great if it is a wet day. You can get literally anything edible you can think of here...lovely fresh fruits/veggies, various meats, baked goods, spices, drinks...you name it. Come hungry so that you can get something to nibble on while you wander the stalls.If you are in any way a 'foodie' this is not to be missed!It is easy to get to/find by the underground.||July 10, 2016
Tom B||50||I have been going to Borough Market probably an average of once a month for the last 8 years. It is the first place I recommend to tourists or those new to London. It is bloody marvellous. Firstly you have the buzz. As you walk around there is this London energy about the place that bounces back off the architecture engulfing you as search out that tastey bite. The food is brilliant. All good quality and I've never had something I've been disappointed with. The vendors know their stuff and the sales approach is perfectly. A friendly, non pushy sales approach that's focus is simply about a shared love of great food. Surrounding the market are lots of areas to move on to but I quite like to eat and then have a walk along the river to tower bridge. ||July 10, 2016
BazJackSalisbury||40||Our only regret about visiting the market was that we were at the start of our day and therefore couldn't buy lots of goodies to cook/eat later. There is very good range of deli goods, fruit, veg and treats such as cakes and chocolates. The prices are not silly for London. There is also a good range of street food on offer so call here when you are getting peckish. Great atmosphere in this buzzing location south of the river which can be easily combined with visits to The Globe or city attractions like St Pauls and The Guildhall.||July 10, 2016
tediag2016||50||Stopped here for lunch on a quick tour of London. Wonderful place with a lot of culture. Perfect way to be immersed in London. Had a wonderful lunch of proper fish and chips! ||July 9, 2016
vacdiva||50||From massive crocks of hot prepared foods to artisan cheeses and pastas, to specialty mustards, breads, spices, and teas, this place has it all. We went one day and then went back another day to get food to take back to the hotel withh us. Dont miss the Proseco Spritzers. The bread from Olivier Bakery was to die for, as were their brownies and cheese straws. I didnt even feel the need to search out Poilane after that.Well worth he effort to get there.||July 9, 2016
Santenay1er||40||This is a major league inner-city market located adjacent to the London Bridge tube station. It sits under the rail tracks in an efficient use of space which also provides shelter when wet weather arrives. The Borough Market is a place which all foodies and other normal people who are interested in good food need to visit. There is a diverse array of permanent merchants who sell meat, produce, cheese, fruits and vegetables and others who offer freshly-prepared snack foods which you eat in any quiet spot you can find in this busy place. The vibe is exciting and busy and it is best to go off hours when the local office workers are at their desks and not at the Borough to buy their lunch. If you go at lunch time it will be crowded and not particularly pleasant. Be warned.||July 9, 2016
Avi W||50||Lovely vendors, gorgeous layout and so much to see, smell, and taste! A wonderful place to spend time munching and wandering. Don't miss it!||July 9, 2016
LadyDoom||30||Now, I am not one for crowds so this isn't going to be somewhere I'd love but this place, at least around 1PM, was almost ridiculously crowded and was quite chaotic with people suddenly stopping dead without any consideration for those pretty much packed in behind them.That said, it is nice and quiet around 9AM, although the stalls didn't seem to be selling anything then, so perhaps try and go early and quickly for the best chance of navigating easily and buying what you want?Crowds aside there was so much variety here it was beyond belief, various drinks from coffees to smoothies, hot food from roast hog, to steak burgers to tandori, sweets and desserts, fish... I can see why this place is a draw to people.Would I come here again though? Mmm, maybe but it would be early on as I wouldn't want to try and navigate though the packs of people again if I could avoid it.||July 9, 2016
Michelle B||30||Although the market has a good variety of produce and products you use at home (flowers, honey, olives, meat, etc.) it is limited in its street food compared to other markets in London. ||July 9, 2016
mealadvisor||50||The array of choices here is astounding. Whether you want food to take home and cook or something to eat straight away, it caters for all tastes. So many delicious things to try (I can vouch for the duck confit sandwich).||July 9, 2016
487linx||50||I have been Borough Market many times over the years, it is always the place to me:inspired, joyful and great fun!Tips:1,Plan ahead, most stalls in the market closes around 4:302,Do not be shy to try the free samples3,Cider from Cornwall's farms is great!||July 9, 2016
astray_yu||30||There were not many shops/ stores opening during a winter Saturday morning. I felt a little bit disappointed. But I still could find my lunch here: cheese sandwich and a cup of warm ginger apple juice. Tourists over the world came and walked around the market mostly. I could not find anythings I wanted to bring home. Maybe it is more interesting during spring or summer.||July 8, 2016
The-Wise-Ones||50||The place to visit in London if you like street food of varieties. Borough Market is a huge place where vendors show off their trade and wares. There are fruit merchants and stalls which sells vegetables, seafood, cheeses, pastries, cookies, cakes, breads, jams etc. There is so much choice of food to sample from stalls that sell: paella, Indian food, Thai, Ethopian, Chinese, kebabs, pies and mash, confi duck wraps, pulled pork wraps, salted beef, and many more. Average cost £5.00 per serving.There are fresh fruit juices and drinks stalls too.Great market and thoroughly enjoyable. Be prepared of large crowds and queues for food as it is such a popular market.We frequent Borough market whenever we are in London. Tube station: London Bridge on Northern Line.You will not be disappointed if you like markets. The Wise-OnesJuly 2016||July 8, 2016
TravellingRog||40||The market was pointed out by the taxi driver on route to our hotel. Amazing little market that we nearly missed. All sorts of smells and tastes to tempt the tastebuds. Close to the river and surrounded by pubs this is a great place to visit.||July 8, 2016
gallivanting_gaurav||40||I really enjoyed visiting at lunch time. There are plenty of stalls that offer all kinds of food and drink options. Decent prices as well.||July 8, 2016
34joc||40||The market is amazing and food superb. Amazed at the value for money. Thoroughly enjoyed out visit. Only one down side was somewhere to sit. ||July 8, 2016
Gloriawednesfield||50||This market is just wonderful, full of wonderful foods from all over the world, can't emphasise enough what a great place to visit this is, and free of charge , although take a few pennies because you will not be able to resist taking something home, it was a revelation to me and my husband how much it had enlarged in ten years.||July 8, 2016
867ians||40||Fabulous cheeses, meats and wines. Pretty much anything you want here!Definitely worth a visit to buy stuff to take home. Nice and atmospheric but does get really busy.An experience to savour though.||July 8, 2016
Liz F||30||Had come down hoping to indulge in baked goods. Had a great coffee but the tarts bought from the french patisserie stall were not good - soggy bottoms. And the pistachio financier was too dense and did not taste much of pistachio. Wish I'd have tried the freshly prepared coconut pancakes from the Thai food stall.Would have been great if I lived in England and could've bought any of the huge variety of cheese or some venison sausages but those things just don't travel well.||July 8, 2016
Kathya100||40||Visited Borough Market a few time in the past few months and each visit has been great. Very busy, especially weekends but the buzz of the place is amazing. The smell of different foods of all nationalities being cooked and the aromas of the cheese and bread stalls really wets your appetite to try some out...So much to choose from..However, not cheap. Borough Market is set next to Southwark Cathedral and just minutes from the Thames with cobbled walkways connecting the two...Well worth visiting..||July 8, 2016
rosemaryf666||50||This place always wows me. The array of food is astounding. Quite a few offer tastings too. There's everything from deli products to food from other nations. The Roquefort cheese sandwich is amazing, the paellas yum and there's even a pub. Many meat, cheese and bakery stalls. ||July 8, 2016
tatianasgd||50||We spent a whole morning at the market and we really loved the experience! Different flavors and cultures around you. For those who loves culinary it's almost a heaven. I could spend a day just trying foods and spices from a lot of places around the world. Our kid loved the experience as well! ||July 7, 2016
Cupcakeschocolate123||40||After the renovations borough market is much prettier and more organised. It's fun to visit and I still go nearly once a month. Prices have gone up as there are more tourists so be careful as some stuff is a rip off.Also better food at Maltby Street Market (this is where the older borough market traders went, the true originals and much tastier/cheaper).||July 7, 2016
669judithb||50||Fantastic market, lovely architecture and great food. Not particularly cheap to eat here but food is great with a large choice... Loved the spice stall!! Been to London many times but never been here before.. Would definitely visit again.||July 7, 2016
travllovr521||30||Borough market was recommended on our last trip but we didn't know about it until we had already missed its open days. This time, made sure to plan to see it, and did so on the day we visited Globe and Tate, both nearby. It was fun to see, but was all food (produce, meats, cheeses, specialty gourmet items and restaurants), no wares or goods. Fun if you're into markets (as I am) but wouldn't recommend going all the way there just for the market, if not seeing other sites in the area. Nothing too remarkable or particularly unique. I'd say go for lunch while visiting Tate or Shakespeare's Globe or if you're wanting gourmet food items. ||July 7, 2016
Matei_Flamaropol||40||This was a very interesting and memorable experience !You can find a lot of things to eat there :)From fresh fruit, vegetables and fresh pressed juices, to cheeses, pastries, sweets, meat cooked in different ways, etc.We went four days in a row there, to a place called "La tua pasta", where we ate the best truffle tortelonni ever !It's a place worth visiting for any tourist !||July 7, 2016
Kathrin-Karl||50||Borough Food Market is a huge food market with fresh cooked food like BBQ, paella, German sausages, asian food and falafel and much more ... You can buy fresh fish, juices, vegs and fruits but also special buffalo mozzarella. Sounds boring? They have truffle honey and oil as well and there are different kinds and you can try them with fresh bread. Truffle honey with nice cheese and baguette sounds good? You will find nice cheeses there as well.You are a desert person? Brilliant, they sell many cakes etc. They are having vegan and gluten-free versions, whole cakes which they sell in nice card boxes. They sell ice cream there as well. Sounds boring? They use goat milk. I didn't try as I don't like goat milk but I am sure it tastes good.They close around 5pm on Saturdays. From 4.30 the two fish sellers sell their fish for half price. If you come from London Bridge and then pass the first fish sellers on your left, there is a vegs shop that sells their juces for just £1 before they close. Just in case you need it: they have wifi as well :)||July 7, 2016
aprilnyeo||50||There's great coffee places, pastries, local favorite of fish&chips, all types of cheese, all European and Asia fresh food stalls, fresh seafood, fresh meat of all sorts, fresh vegetables, seasonal fruits & vegetables, restaurants, flower shops, bicycle shop, endless countless numbers of pubs, wine shops... And the list goes on and on and on... A great place to check out. However it's close on Sundays.||July 7, 2016
paulsH3240JE||50||Food types from all over the world, great pubs and a wonderful uplifting ambiance. One of the best places to visit in London and always overlooked by travellers who prefer the business of Camden. If you're visiting London visit the market at all costs||July 6, 2016
luvtravel88||40||This market was stall after stall of mostly food vendors of different types. There were charcuterie and cheese vendors, meat and fish vendors, fruit and vegetable vendors and various sweets vendors. There were also some stalls that sold ready made foods although many of the stalls sold items that you would need to go home and prepare.We found some small savory pies from a stand called Pieminster which were fantastic. There are also some stalls that sell things like spices, soaps, candles, etc...The Marketplace was packed and it was difficult to move around the crowd at times. Most of the stalls are under cover but some are out in the open.The Marketplace has a long and interesting history and if interested, check out their website as they do have guided tours certain times of the day.||July 6, 2016
TripMember061620171||50||This ancient London Market near the Shard is easily reached by tube from either Borough or London Bridge. Only fully open Thursday-Saturday. An absolute for foodies. Fantastic fresh fruit and vegetables and artisan breads. Several top class fromageries to go with the bread. Excellent butchers and fish stalls selling top quality game and other organic meats. With slice stalks, truffles, specialist olive oils, beer and wines the list just goes on. Many pubs and restaurants around and within the market for meals. On one side of the market are ethnic food stalls from all over the world. You really must visit for a fantastic experience. ||July 6, 2016
900gwenm||40||Crowds were manageable but many of the stands are closed on Monday. Had food from Ethiopian Flavour. Tasty! My husband enjoyed his Egyptian food. The boys had good burgers but they were expensive. Would go back to try something else next time.||July 6, 2016
Oded R||30||A nice place to visit but the food itself is not at the level its hyped up to be. Pretty big variety though so most will find something they like.||July 6, 2016
Sarah C||50||My husband and I came here at least twice during our stay in London. The market is much like a Farmers Market you might find in the States, only turned up to 11. THere are tons of vendors offering all kinds of foods ... and you can pretty try all of it! There are truffles, olive oils, bread, meats, and amazing oysters! Definitely get some fish n chips for lunch here at least once. And if you can spot the salted beef booth ... you gotta get one of those sandwiches. Delicious!||July 6, 2016
amheinen||50||This was the best food we had out of the 40 days we travelled Europe! I recommend trying everything you can there. We tried the fish and chips which was absolutely amazing, pie & mash, salted beef sandwich, veggie burger/ salad, and a mixture of curries. Everything was amazing and cheap, I HIGHLY recommend this market. ||July 6, 2016
yoz08||50||I love this place, if you like food, cooking or just plain eating you have to go here. I go every time I go to London as I find the place fascinating. It is expensive but worth it all the same, it is London! On a Saturday around lunch time it is best avoided as it gets so busy, but there is always something worth trying or buying for something to be cooked at home at the weekend. What a great place. ||July 6, 2016
benjinoona||50||Great place to visit after going to Tate Modern. Walk for about 7 minutes towards the Shard (can't miss it) and tada! A foodie heaven will be right in front of your eyes. One word of advice would be have cash (Though many vendors take credit, its just easier to have cash) and COME HUNGRY!||July 5, 2016
Charles S||50||I visited this market for the first time although I have been in London many times. The variety of places to eat and buy basically food products was amazing and the quality of produce was very high. The colours of the various fruits and vegetables was a delight in itself. ||July 5, 2016
rdachtler||50||best palce to go for lunch. was amazing really nice selection. definite must for anyone in London. brilliant ||July 5, 2016
ChilliPepper1||40||Great place to spend the morning browsing the food stalls. We had a long, boozy lunch at Wright Brothers and it was fantastic. ||July 5, 2016
ChristiHamilton||50||A great place to visit for local cheeses, produce, bread, meat, beer, tea, etc. We wandered aimlessly around the market and left with bags full of local goodies. We loved it so much we went back again. Friday and Saturday are the best days, because although it's more crowded, more of the vendors/shops are open. The Borough Market will make you feel like a local!||July 5, 2016
jajavalB||50||This food market is the real international, local cuisine heaven, just within walking distance from London bridge tube station. I enjoy best budget food of famous producers from locals and other EUs. Boston sausage is well recommended by eating when I stood and look around for further menu. Monmouth coffee is also best to taste. Desserts are also plentiful, including 3bis yoghurt icecream, bread ahead for its pastries and etc. I can enjoy food with budget only 20pounds. ||July 5, 2016
lizard076||50||So many interesting stalls, all the food we had was top-quality and creative, and we liked that we could stop at so many stalls and assemble just the meal or snack we wanted. It closes about 4:30 pm, so get there early. We especially liked the place that made its own salamis and the small beer shop where you could score microbrews.||July 4, 2016
Lobsterlover99||50||What's not too love? A healthy thriving market filled with artisan food and drink stalls. A periodic visitor here I wished I lived nearer. Walking round with friends we chose items for a picnic later the next day. A pork pie was to die for, many cheeses and fresh bread were bought and cider drunk. We all developed the knack for sniffing out the freshly made free samples and spent rather too much money. I'm afraid there are those just there to take photos and to sight see, but if you are shopping avoid the Saturday crowd is my advice and just chill and munch your way around the market.||July 4, 2016
YeeShern L||30||There are a lot of choices of foods, starters to main meals and dessert. Different variety of foods sold too. It is definitely a place to go if you are a foodie =)||July 4, 2016
Tracy H||50||The best food markets I have been to. The fresh produce is just something else here and the "street food" style of eating is great. Be sure to grab freshly shucked oysters, grab a pimms and eat fresh made pasta. Just make sure you wear something loose because you won't be going home hungry!||July 3, 2016
Childminderjan||50||Even if you are not going to buy lots of food this is a great market to look round, The different stalls are full of lots of fresh produce with lots of vibrant colours, smells and friendly folk.||July 3, 2016
kristyrebecca||50||one of my favourite spots in london. great food with lots of different stalls with all different types of foods. if you're vegetarian there's lots of good options. ||July 3, 2016
JohnW1966||50||I visited with my wife, we spent a couple of hrs browsing around all of the food stalls. Every choice of street food available for lunch, wow. I wanted to eat from every stall, but that will take a lot of visits. The food looked great, fruit veg, fish, meat, cheese everything we even found some pomegranate molasses which we had been looking everywhere for.We will return, but Saturday lunch time is busy.....||July 3, 2016
McAnnie1||50||Every visit to London we visit Borough Market & go through the same ritual - a glass of rose prosecco & a snack from one of the fab food stalls. Just wish we could carry all the amazing cheeses & breads home to Scotland. ||July 3, 2016
SandyBeachBumTM||50||This market has two sections; the one outdoors is all the prepared foods, the one inside is more the market food like vegetables, fish and meat. I had been here before and so knew what to expect. The variety of sweets and food is mind boggling. I got some truffle oil and spread at such a good price at the truffle stand. Home made chocolates are amazing. The one thing I was SO SO looking forward to was raclette made by a guy who is, apparently, always there. Except the day we went. He was at a cheese convention!!! I was heartbroken. I had raved about the raclette to my daughter and it truly was going to be a highlight of the entire trip - it is THAT good. So ... yeah... sad about that.Don't miss this place. Well worth the trip from wherever you're staying.||July 3, 2016
908ciskab||50||Every time I'm in London, I always visit borough market, the vegetable, fish, meat, bread and chocolate stalls are great. An absolute topper on Borough Market is Spice Mountain. I allow myself to buy 3 spices. that never happens, they have so many beautiful produce...||July 3, 2016
lola584||50||Borough market is a must do.....must see place. You can spend several hours wandering around the many stalls sampling tasty pieces of meat/cheese etc and talking to the stall holders. The fresh produce of the fruit and veg looking particularly colourful. Plenty of places to buy cooked food take a seat, enjoy a pimms/beer and people watch. A great ambience and only 2 minutes walk from London Bridge underground. The only negative was the owner of the Gated Garden as I was interested in buying a tall plant (metre high) and asked if she had a long bag for packaging/transportation on the train home......."No" take it or leave it attitude .....so I left it! Not warm or helpful like the other stall holders! Shame......||July 3, 2016
lobster64||40||There is always a lovely atmosphere of times gone by sights smells and sounds.There are traditional fruit and veg stalls, pie and pasty stalls, fish mongers alongside modern versions selling prosecco and Duck wraps.There is the Market porter and the Wheatsheaf pubs across the road. Great tradition from yester year.There is the Roast restaurant sitting above the market from which, along with great cuisine you can watch all the comings and goings of the market below.||July 2, 2016
jstrat||50||The Borough Market is a great way to experience London. Whether shopping for fresh meats, produce, cheese, baked goods, wine, etc., walking around eating and or drinking at the great fresh food stops in the market, eating at a nearby restaurant, hanging out at one of the pubs, or getting a hair cut at Hobbs Barbershop, Borough Market is always a great experience. Conveniently located next to the London Bridge tube station, the market is one of our favorite places to hang out during the day in London.||July 2, 2016
OritN||50||We visited the market on a Wednesday morning and it was not crowded. There are many stands and little shops that offer a variety of dishes and there are also fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, cheeses etc. on sale. It was very pleasant to hang out for an hour or so, it is a must for foodies. There are options for vegetarians and many deserts.Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area on the days of the full market (Wednesday-Saturday).||July 2, 2016
dougbZ4601SO||50||What a wonderful way to spend the afternoon browsing among the fresh fruits, breaks and specialty meats. The only place in London I found beautiful heirloom tomatoes. Also, the best prosciutto di parma and the cheese selection was obscene it was so good. Take the tour and get the inside info. Worth the time and the walk for sure.||July 2, 2016
Paula110||50||This place attacks all of your senses. Wonderful !! Impressive to see sellers of fine produce from all parts of the country and overseas too. Delicious. When to stop eating and buying ? ||July 2, 2016
kenh393||50||I have now been to the Borough Market about 5 times on my various visits to London, and I love it just as much each time. Lots of great options for street food of all types, fabulous delicacies, amazing "period" setting, which all make for a great experience. You won't be disappointed. ||July 2, 2016
Jwheezy22||50||Borough market is always a great stop for a bimble when in London Bridge, lots of food choices and samples available for cheeses, hams, jams, chutneys etc, very busy but a haven for food lovers||July 2, 2016
jfkoutnik||50||If you "live to eat" you must set aside a few hours one day in your life to visit this gastronomical delight and beverage heaven. Enough said...just go there and your understand ||July 2, 2016
grandma648||50||What a wonderful place this really is and there are so many samples from cheeses to sweets and biscuits. The market traders are so passonate about thier wares and so interesting and engaging. Its bustling with life and laughter and I just love it. I has food and fun and brilliantly situated with lots of little shops to browse and get different things. Its mainly food and good quality. It easy to access from London Bridge and quite near to various shops the river and to local pubs and business's. Go here and find out for yourself as you will not regret this lovely place. When the traders go ...its quite and loses its atmosphere until the next day when it all begins again. I love the people and the culture in this market.||July 1, 2016
Tiffanyma2012||40||Borough Market is kind of a must-go place everytime I go to London, especially when I go with my sister who is a fan of the Scotch Egg there. The place is in good size - smaller than the market in Camden Town, but you can leave with a full stomach. I absolutely love the food there. Scotch egg is my favorite. I tend to order it as my first dish. It's hard for me to finish everything there especially much food is pastry based, like the German hotdog, or the pitta bread with meat. Last time I had so much food and on top of that we crossed by a fish and chips place and ordered again. That was a wrong decision made. I would advise people to pick the food carefully - the portion of food there is hearty and unless you have people to share the food with, it's good to just pick 1-2 choices. Overall I think the food there is tasty, yet the price is bit high considered it's popularity. I find the place bit touristy like too compared with the similar food market in Camden town. Yet I would still highly recommend the place for people for a first-time visit, especially if you want to go to the market, then enjoy a walk near the river towards London Bridge and Tower Bridge.||July 1, 2016
Touristy_D||40||Great place for gourmands to sample a variety of cuisines and dishes and contemporary takes on them. But even if you're not there to tuck in the food, go for the experience. The place is so lively!||June 30, 2016
runsuerun60||50||I'm so happy to know about this great place. Tons of vendors selling food food food flowers vegetables fruit fish vinegars oils pastries and dishes from all over the world. Go early at 10 before all the lunch crowds. Wander and taste and buy and then settle on a lunch delicacy. ||June 30, 2016
DANDGS2016||50||We felt a little provincial when we visited the market, it was bustling and busy and the selection of food blew our minds, and not particularly expensive compared to London in general......we need something like this in Brisbane......bravo London||June 30, 2016
Jana D||50||This was a very crowded street market style place with a TON of delicious food options!!! Fancy cheeses, breads, sausages, SO many yummy options. Expect to need to pay CASH (there are ATMs nearby) and that it's really crowded. Keep an eye on your wallet as well - touristy locations mean pickpockets! Just be cautious, it's really a lovely place. One of the best meals we ate just from trying a ton of food there.||June 30, 2016
Riley1964||50||Excellent entertainment. I could imagine it years ago when it would have been purely a produce market, now it's very touristy and a bit on the expensive side. Wonderful array of cooked food to nibble on (free tasters), and I saw varieties of tomatoes and mushrooms etc., that I've never seen before. Great place to go for ingredients if you want to cook something special. Well worth a visit and make sure you go hungry. Lovely place to wonder around on a nice day - next time I go I will take a "cool bag" to fill - close to the Thames, and the gothic Southwark Cathedral is stunning......||June 30, 2016
TilehurstSandra||50||Absolutely fantastic food market, the very best street food to be found in London. Very popular, and packed daily. Not to be missed!||June 30, 2016
clelhunt||50||This is a must to visit when in London. It is a gourmet`s delight and surrounded by lovely pubs, cafes and eateries. Central located under the railway lines at London Bridge, you can sit over a nice wine and watch the world pass by!||June 29, 2016
rebem||50||Love browsing the various food stalls and then deciding which one to select for lunch. It can be incredibly busy so you must not mind being in a crowd !||June 29, 2016
jzzy649||50||The variety felt endless! There were so many quirky and interesting vendors. And most vendors were happy for you to sample their wares without pressuring you to purchase anything.||June 29, 2016
anthro92||50||This was one of our must-sees when in London, and it did not disappoint. After visiting the Tower of London, we walked across Tower Bridge and along South Bank before turning away from the river and coming upon Borough Market. The walk was a little over a mile, and very pleasant. We enjoyed checking out all the food stalls, and ate at Roast Hog, which was very good. There were so many options to choose from, though, that I would try something different the next time. We also had coffee at Monmouth Coffee (amazing!) and purchased some cheese from Neal's Yard Dairy. We were there on a Friday, and it was quite busy, but not too bad. ||June 29, 2016
yhozkan||50||If you want to eat delicious street foods in London, that is the place you must go especially in Saturday.||June 29, 2016
fionah961||50||We had been previously on a weekend but had one last day in London before returning to Australia. Before going to do a few of our final things, we spent a couple of hours at Borough Market.Easy to get to from most parts of London, it is a small market with a great variety. There is a sense of street market with lots of things to eat, and also good coffee (the best of our trip). There are also meats, fish and fruits and vegetables.Some stalls are not open on Tuesdays, but there is certainly enough to make it a worthwhile exercise.Beware there is only 1 public toilet, with a huge queue. Paying for a beer are the Globe is a viable option.There are also many interesting shops in the streets around the Market, and a bread making school ( if only I had a bit more time in London)||June 28, 2016
Pam S||50||Great way to spend a Saturday morning. Shopping for regular supplies or something for a special recipe, it has the lot. Fabulous breads, fresh veggies, seafood and fish, lots of eateries for a snack. Crowded and alive with enthusiasm for good food. Highly recommend||June 28, 2016
dil345||40||If you are going to visit this place, go hungry. There is a large variety of food choices to choose from. It is nice that there is no smoking allowed-yeah!-and no dogs allowed. It doesn't really take long to wander through. We got some curry here to eat and it was fairly good. My issue with the market is that there is hardly anyplace to sit down to eat unless you eat at one of the restaurants.||June 28, 2016
Michelle L||40||Apparently it is one of london's oldest markets. It has plenty of charm and character. The stalls were diverse, my favourite was Spice Mountain, so many spices in one place and reasonably priced. ||June 28, 2016
DunelmArts||50||There has been a market close to this site for 1000 years – in 2014 the market held its millennium celebrations. Today it is a Foodie paradise. Open 6 days a week, Monday – Saturday, Borough Market really is an assault on the senses – appetising smells waft from the attractively displayed food stalls, the produce, both food and drink, taste delicious. This is all set against the noise of the trains rumbling overhead into London Bridge Station, the market traders’ calls and the hubbub of the shoppers. The quality and choice is good – cheese, meat, fish, beer & cider, wine, oils & vinegars, confectionary, bread, patisserie – the list goes on and on. It’s well worth a look if you’re in the area. Be aware that the full market is only operational Wednesday to Saturday. On Monday and Tuesday, the market still opens but with a smaller selection of stalls. If you’re looking for something specific, check that your stallholder will be there before you go.||June 28, 2016
Cindyandthegirls||50||We had the pleasure of visiting the market last March. We arrived right when they opened and enjoyed amazing coffee at Monmouth Coffee. We spent several hours sharing food from the amazing food stalls. We bought honey, spices, jam, wine, bread, and cheese. Most of the vendors were pleasant, especially the honey guy. There is some seating (limited) and a bathroom at the back of the stall area. We loved this place and wished we had spent more time there. Bring a shopping bag and your appetite, you won't be sorry. A defininate must visit.||June 28, 2016
buttsy||40||We went here with a business colleague and I was pleasantly surprised with the variety and number of places to eat. Does street food as well as sit down restaurants||June 27, 2016
TinaCrouch||50||My friend and I ate our way through Borough Market for probably a good two hours. We started with some fresh pressed juice, got some vegan Indian food, a very British pie, sweet coconut pancakes, some goat's milk ice cream, and finished it off with sangria. Everything was delicious, and there were so many other options that looked tasty. Make sure you arrive hungry. ||June 27, 2016
Mark R||40||Id been meaning to come here for a long time, its close to London Bridge railway station and is a selection of wierd and wonderful stalls, exotic foods, craft beers and my highlight Spicemountain..The market has a number of food sellers, dishing out lovely fresh cooked food, my only grumble is that it could do with some seating where you could enjoy the food.In summary, loved it and will be back.||June 27, 2016
weestevieb||40||We had Ethiopan curry from a stall. £4 for a good portion of tasty food. Really good value. They just need to provide seating.||June 27, 2016
nemagem||40||A great way to spend a saturday morning in London - especially if it is raining. The market is a couple blocks from the London bridge station. There is a wide array of hot food, drinks, cheeses, fresh produce, meats, wine, seafood etc...you name it, you'll find it there. All good quality stuff too. Tried so many samples that i pretty much was filled just off of that. it does get really crowded but i think it is worth the visit.This should definitely be on your list if you get to spend a weekend in London. There are also loads of restaurants/pubs/bars/coffee shops right outside the market, where you can choose to extend your morning into an afternoon.||June 27, 2016
ClarkeAJ||50||Always enjoy wandering through Borough Market, there is always so much delicious food to inspire me. So much choice, I struggle to decide what I want to buy and go home and cook!||June 27, 2016
no_ruckgrets||50||I had a blast at Brorough! There was free wifi, music, places to sit, lots of variety and maybe best of all lots of free samples! ||June 27, 2016
NLPatricia||50||Lovely market with food all over the world. Too bad I couldn't take a 4D picture with all the smells, noises and different styles of food. This was the perfect lunch!||June 27, 2016
Niki C||40||This place is amazing! It has everything! It has stall after stall of food from around the world. I could not tell you how good the air smelled! I recommend coming hungry!||June 27, 2016
Nisha S||40||I have been here couple of times now , I really enjoy it. Its so easy to get to and the market and the place is well organised. The food is good and smells amazing.Drinks are bit pricey. The only down side is ,I brought some avocados thinking they were fresh but was surprised to see them all rotten the next day. I would suggest to refrain from any food shopping from the stall near the famous oyster place.||June 27, 2016
Lee m||40||Yep, it's a tourist mecca - but don't be put off by the hustle! The food here is DELICIOUS!!!! I had a noodle box and the serving was generous and although i felt like I was about to pop, I managed to eat a German cake (custard, honey, almonds...oh my!).If i go back, next on the menu is a kangaroo burger!!!||June 27, 2016
las57||50||Just down the road from London Bridge railway stn. Incredible selection of produce, dozens of stalls selling an amazing selection of goods. Wish there was a similar venue near my home town. Could have spent a fortune, alas no viable as a day tripper, enroute else where||June 26, 2016
Michelle E||50||Such an array of food stalls in such a grand old pavillion. We could have wandered around for hours. Every stall holder seemed happy to share samples and were very knowledgable about their products and there was every kind of street food conceivable to choose from. It was busy but still enough room to get around and reach the stalls that we wanted to. Some stalls were a little pricey, but it is London and you get what you pay for. Would love to go back again as I am sure that we didn't see half of what we could have.||June 26, 2016
havardk2014||50||Borough Market is our favourite food market in Europe . Wide selections of of fine food , local and international . You find cheeses , patees , salamis , meats of all kinds and flavours , local and exotic fruit and vegs , juice, fine wines, spirits and sensational varieties of gin , just bag up , you will not find better choises elsewhere !Best of all is the many food stalls where you can enjoy really good snacks and bites . When you need to sit down , relax and have a meal there is even a super Fish Market restaurant . We enjoyed it thoroughly ! ||June 26, 2016
greedygreedy||50||Great place to pick up cheeses, fine wines and bread. My favorite market on a Sat or during the week to grab a cider or Pimm's and wander about for fresh veggies, meats, and other goodies. Went on a rainy day and still had an amazing visit.||June 26, 2016
LukasB256||50||One of the most beautiful and interesting streetmarkets i have ever seen. Nestled under a railwayline and inbetween its pillars are dozens of little shops and stands, complete with a high percentage of street sellers.Just wonderful!||June 26, 2016
Aredmond110||50||Totally yummy adventure. Take time to wander about and sample all the goodies. Loved the cider and there is a major array of cheeses to get after. So many other choices to try out and a joy for any foodie. ||June 25, 2016
stepusin||50||Even if you are just walking through this place it is worth visiting as a tourist. There are tons of foods to buy, even if they are just snacks. Artists are selling goods and there are tons of foods to buy from local vendors. I stopped by a local beer vendor who was very informative about local and European beers. Highly recommended.||June 25, 2016
WhiteL28||50||Foodie paradise, incredibly huge variety of savoury, sweet, baked goods, hot food, cold food, fresh vegetables and meats... Need I say more. No better way to spend a weekend morning. ||June 25, 2016
Jane S||50||I love markets that are authentic, services locals and offer a broad range of food and experiences. We walked here from Marlin Apartments and were able to stock our larders full! The food was amazing and mostly affordable.I would love to go back here. If you are in the area and you are a foodie, it is a MUST!||June 24, 2016
bglhvn||50||We lunched here after leaving the Tower Bridge Experience. Crowded with food booths of all types and people, we found there are few places to sit. The booth areas are surrounded by local streets also housing food establishments. I don't remember the name, but found tasty gelato in one of those and wish we had allowed much more time to explore this area.||June 24, 2016
WirWeltweit||50||Absolutely loved it. Take your time and have some drinks and food there. It is a good start for a walk to Tower Bridge, very close to London Bridge station.||June 24, 2016
J_Fizzle89||50||Absolutely love these markets! Always a fantastic atmosphere with lots of people. A massive choise of food here from Thai, Ethiopian, British, baked goods to goats milk icecream. Also a good variety of fresh produce. A must see if in London and looking for amazing fresh food!||June 24, 2016
danielMcV||50||What an amazing place! If you enjoy street food this is the best place to take your meals in London. You can buy all kind of spices and ingredients and you can even taste the food before buying it. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious. This is a must see location if you want to taste different ethnic recipes||June 24, 2016
Tomme T||50||A must for all foodies. There's so many options to eat & drink here, and with such a variety as well. Up there with Camden Market.We particularly enjoyed the roast pork roll from a stand called Roast Hog, the chorizo rolls from Brindisa, the sangria from Le Marche du Quartier and the coffee from Monmouth to bring us back from the food coma, amongst the many things we tried here.Highly recommended to go on an empty stomach so you can fit more in.||June 23, 2016
Elsa K||50||All you need for that quality local and international produce right here! Enjoy and be merry with excellent choice of food.  It is closed on Sunday. On Monday and Tuesday, only half of the market is open. So if you want to enjoy full experience of Borough Market, do come on Wednesay-Saturday||June 23, 2016
rosytogs||50||Truly loved this market, what a fantastic atmosphere. Very lively and full of character, loved all the local producers who you can see take so much pride in their produce. Very busy so try go early before lunch. ||June 23, 2016
d0nna8383||50||What a great market, full of customers and stall holders selling there delicious wares. We enjoy walking around this positive environment and had a lovely lunch and bought a few treats to take home.||June 23, 2016
seitay||50||It is a fantastic place to eat, to drink, to buy authentic, fresh and different kind of food and beverages.||June 23, 2016
Coma219||50||If you want to try ethnic food (indian, German, Ethiopian, French, Spanish) but also delicious burgers do not miss this spot!For those who went to Barcelona, it is a sort of Boqueria (but without sea food). Great food and good vibe. ||June 22, 2016
Martin C||50||A huge selection of food and market items. I bought fresh spices. Enjoyed a kangaroo burger. Many street food venders set up in booths.||June 22, 2016
AlexanderfedericoIV||50||As a foodie and chef this is a must visit location. The area is small enough to walk in a couple of hours but you will most likely end up spending a half day here. The prices are cheap and negotiable and he food vendors come from all over the world literally. Keep in mind this market is closed on Mondays. But the rest of the week it's open from 8am-5pm. ||June 22, 2016
wersacom||50||Bustling with energy and a great selection of all kinds of food items this market is a must! From dry aged steaks and the freshest seafood strait off the boats to street foods from around the World this market will satisfy any foodie.||June 21, 2016
Eligijus R||40||Everything in one place - nice market place in central area for tourists. As it's more for tourists - the prices a bit too high.This market is under the roof so It's a good idea for rainy days as well.||June 21, 2016
Kelpiefan||50||To see the fresh vegetables, fish, etc. makes you weep when all you have on your own door step is a 'major supermarket' which cannot compare with the offerings on sale here. I hope London people appreciate what they have on their door step.||June 21, 2016
jayceek2013||50||One of the best gastronomical and graphical market I've ever seen!So much yummy looking food to try in various food stalls. There's also venison sold here and ethnicity food of diverse nationality.Best go with light bags or have your hands free to touch, feel and eat your way through!Lots of cheese and wine to try and also you can have a sniff at truffles and get some if you like it! Recommended to go as a couple or with family and friends. ||June 21, 2016
903duygua||40||The market offers a variety of food but closes a bit early. Nice place even to just walk around but not that large.||June 21, 2016
andersfredin||50||Burough Market was new to me and what a great little treasure to discover! If you are interested in food and classical markets this is definately the place for you. Just neighbouring the market you´ll find small cafés and restaurants with great food at an equaly great price. Oh, and by the way, this is where Bridget Jones (from Bridget Jones diary) lived and where you´ll find the café where Hugh Grant had the fight in the movie. Furthermore, this is where Harry (Potter) gets of the magical buss in "the order of the Phoenix". ||June 21, 2016
MShew2015||50||On arrival we went straight to Mammoth coffee shop because it was so highly recommended. The queue indicated how popular it was and the line moved very quickly so the service was excellent. The coffee was good and my husband really enjoyed his but I was disappointed that the didn't have soy milk and had to have a espresso. We walked leisurely through the market examining an amazing choice of fresh foods. It was a wonderful experience and we felt like we were in foodie heaven. ||June 20, 2016
HorngCherng||50||From traditional English menu like pie&mash, Scotch egg to Indian, Malaysian, Ethiopian, Argentinian food. You name it, they have it. Good food at affordable price (by London's standard). ||June 20, 2016
debbiesobek||50||London at its best, such an array of food and drinks from across the world the atmosphere is buzzing would suit any age there's something there for everyone, I can highly recommend the calamari stand.||June 20, 2016
harristhepooh||50||We went there twice during our holiday in London - once on Saturday and once on Wednesday. Saturday is a traditional busy day with tones of tourists and locals but you do get the best products and most stores opening, while Wednesday a lot less people (mainly tourists going) but products was not as fresh and not all stores open. The food we tried and recomend to you;- Richard Haward's Oyster - Le Marche du Quartier for the amazing confit duck roll- Roast Hog - remember to get the crispy skin- Khanom Krok for the coconut pancake- Cartwright Brothers for their pimmWe tried some other food but is not really good so did not put in the above list. There are many more other stores that looked amazing too, but we were too full to try.||June 20, 2016
lordwebb||30||Well worth a visit for foodies , a good walk around attraction however... and this is the problem everything is overpriced and overstated in my opinion.Most of the food on offer is actually nothing special , I bought some bread which looked great but at home it turned out poor and tasteless , I also bought some tomatoes advertised and sold to me as the best Heritage versions, outrageous price and also very average in taste.I don't like walking around eating out of plastic so the many pop up food stalls didn't attract I ended up eating in the "Fish" restaurant which I have reviewed as being excellent.There is a good cheese stall run by very enthusiastic French chaps also a bit pricey but the product was really good and they are happy to give you tasting nibbles.So to summarise a good day out but be careful what you buy and taste first if you can.||June 19, 2016
ianthy||40||After promising to visit Borough market for ages, I finally made the trip last Friday. This is a real food heaven ranging from the traditional fruit, veg, fish and meat. Then special produce cheeses, breads and street food area. Plus a number of sit down restaurants too. You could easily spend most of the day and a lot of money in the market, so it's best to plan carefully what you really want to see and enjoy. We liked the cheese stalls, Italian truffles and street food - be prepared for long queues and no where to sit. I think this is the only negative about the day - there is virtually no seating unless you are dining at a restaurant. Otherwise I would def recommend Borough market for a half day visit.||June 19, 2016
NinaTom||50||First visit back in almost a year and still as fun to wander around and take in the smells and sights. As always, came out with a bag full of goodies. It's important to buy something if visiting - I guess if everyone just wandered round gawping and taking photos rather than buying stuff there wouldn't be a market. Couldn't find the Raclette stall serving glorious, gooey cheese - the only disappointment! ||June 19, 2016
Vijgeblad||50||The market does two things: food and specialty ingredients. It excels in both. The ingredients are from all over the world, with novelty stuff you seldom use in the kitchen mixed in liberally. I like spice mountain, but buy from other stalls also. The food is mostly foreign, simple, fresh and delicious. Try finding the pulled pork sandwich with Bramley apple sauce. For sweets, avoid complicated stuff like macarons. Go for simple things like cannelés from Bordeaux instead. Try a shot of grass so you can tell a tall tale, not for the taste :-)||June 19, 2016
Bellinghamster64||50||The whole family enjoyed our visit to Borough Market. It was a vibrant atmosphere, with colorful displays, and yummy food booths! Vendors were mostly friendly, many offering samples. ||June 19, 2016
Gracie_Roberts||30||90% of shops are selling pastries and cookies and you can buy these anywhere..There is a Turkish store that we discovered and we bought a rose jam which I found original and interesting. I also tried their coffee which was good but not as good as it should have been ( at the bottom of my coffee there was some coffee lumps so basically the guy didn't take his time to make a proper coffee) Nothing else was that interesting in the borough market. There are also a few shops that sell food but the choices are limited compared to another market such as Camden. ||June 19, 2016
47peterm47||50||I cannot come to London now without coming here. It is a great place to just wander around and nibble. My daughter loves it. So much high class produce. Bars, eating establishments all around and only a few minutes form London Bridge station.||June 19, 2016
AZ_Traveler21||50||We visited Borough Market on a Friday afternoon. It was bustling with people. We walked through first before deciding what to get for our late lunch. The choice was not easy as there was so much to pick from at not only the actual market but also the shops and restaurants that surround it. We chose a vegetarian patty, a cheese & olive stick, and a fabulous caramel brownie. I don't know how crowded it gets on Saturday, but Friday afternoon was perfect for us and we were able to get close enough to the stalls for plenty of free samples. The market is definitely worth a stop if you're a foodie, or just hungry!!!||June 18, 2016
176DavidB||30||I have been to Borough Market previously and love the vibe. There are numerous food stalls including a wide range of good value street food options. Key issue on this visit was that it was dangerously overcrowded. Long lines to buy food and nowhere to eat it. Constantly being bumped or unable to move in the jam of people. Have not seen it this busy before. Would not go again at peak time and would suggest either an early or late visit to have space to enjoy the experience. Really like this part of London and is worth walking around.||June 18, 2016
RingoN24||50||We came here twice because we loved these markets. Beware though, they don't open on Sunday! We came on an empty stomach and enjoyed going around to different stalls to purchase food and drinks to eat. ||June 18, 2016
crhuckaby||50||For some reason I hadn't heard of this place until I got to London and started to do some research. I love food markets, and this place was the best! Like an upscale and larger Pike Place. An absolute must for food lovers. We had amazing donuts, meat pies, coffee, cheese, you name it! Just wander around and EAT! Look for the biggest lines and you can't go wrong. The ambiance and location were great too.||June 18, 2016
Braeburn33||40||Great place for a spot of lunch if your undecided about what you fancy! Went here with friends and we all managed to find something to meet our varied diet needs. Highly recommend! ||June 18, 2016
8UKvisitor2015||50||Great experience. Come hungry. From zebra burgers to mead, lots of things that won't be found in a typical store at home. If one has facilities to cook during their stay this place is even better. But if you're just here to sample, there are more than enough options. Products from across Europe and beyond. Terrific market.||June 17, 2016
Momma B||40||Borough Market is a must-stop on a visit to London. It really does have something for everyone. Not hungry or thirsty? Take a stroll and marvel at all of the cuisines from around the world, plus the stalls with some non-food goods. And if you are peckish or thirsty, well, you can have anything you want here: paella, curry and rice, hand-dipped chocolate strawberries, French cheeses, house-made Italian pastas and sauces, pastries, fruit cups and freshly-squeezed juice, soups and stews, hamburgers, and even a good old Scotch egg butty with brown sauce. You could probably eat from a different stall twice a day for a month and *still* not visit every one. The only thing keeping me from giving that 5-dot rating is that there really aren't many places to sit down at all; this is either an eat-and-stroll stop, or you can take your food back to the riverside and plop down somewhere. Go hungry and with a spirit of adventure, and you won't be disappointed.||June 17, 2016
jujubean4||50||This market is an all food market. OMG. Come hungry. The Indian food was amazing. Everything is beautifully displayed and it is a joy towel and eat and walk and eat. Definitely go. Lunch would be perfect...||June 17, 2016
CIDERMAN1||40||Wow. How diverse. Frequented the market today 17th June and was totally surprised how diverse the visitors were. This is a predominantly food market and has heaps of tradition. Every race colour creed and religion must have been there. The street food from almost every continent of the world was on view and for sale. The veg and fresh food was in abundance. The fresh food, breads cheese olives, mustards was also on great show. A fantastic experience all round. There are bars and restaurants to eat and drink if you don't fancy the street food and all do these offer excellent menus. Totally spoilt for choice and certainly too many to visit in any one short period of time. Cannot wait to return and will do in a very short while. Just outside London bridge railway station makes it very easy to reach and from here a good starting point to visit many other attraction in London. Tube, buses and taxis are all easily accessible which lends itself to further attractions within easy reach.||June 17, 2016
Chris B||50||I hadn't been for a while, but used the excuse of taking an Italian friend on her first trip to London. It was even better than I remember. Just superb.||June 17, 2016
Swiss-Chris-vA||50||A must see in london!This market has mostly food. But not normal food you would find in grocerystore or supermarket. Handcrafted, delicious, specials, bio, anything special, like goatmilk icecream. You can buy anything from fish, meat, cheese, sweets, vegetables, fruit, drinks... or simply eat directly any streetfood. ||June 17, 2016
566laures||50||Be prepared to be so! Amazing array of foods & vendors. Few places to sit down...most eat while standing. Could take a good hour to really go through. I suggest a weekday visit not at lunch time.||June 17, 2016
denzisere2||40||Very nice market with live entertainment and lots and lots of food, all high quality food and drink, definitely worth a visit.||June 17, 2016
Emily S||40||Visited here last Saturday lunch. The market was very busy, but has a good selection of food stalls on offer. Worth a visit!||June 16, 2016
A_Food_Awakening||50||Borough Markets are just one of the many markets found in London. After recommendation of a friend, these markets are a great place to buy fresh produce, meat and seafood. The selection is overwhelming and if you are that person who loves cheese and charcuterie these are the markets for you. Regarding food, I didn’t know where to start. I came for lunch and the selection is plentiful from all the different food stalls. Whats really cool is that the food stands offer a range of ethnic food. I actually ended up choosing Ethiopian. With the choices of beef or chicken, and then the choice of 2 sides and rice or the Ethiopian injera. It was a great choice for a winters meal for a cold day and great value for money. We also grabbed a pulled duck sandwich. Something you wouldn’t normally find at a markets. The only downfall is that there isn’t a heap of seating to sit down at.There are food stands for all reasons, whether its fresh bread loaves, turkish delights or quick lunch. I will definitely be returning. I am a huge fan of food markets and you can always get fresh produce for a great price.RatingFood: 9/10Service: 8/10Value for Money: Very Good8 Southwark Street, London SE1 1TLOpening Hours:Mon-Thurs 10am-5pmFri 10am-6pmSat 8am-5pm||June 16, 2016
Mark B||50||A short walk from the Tate Modern we made our way to this famous food Market, as we came around the corner the Buzz, smells & noises hit you. Lots of samples to try, lots of food to buy. We had some amazing food on our visit & staff on all stalls were friendly & helpful. Make sure if you near you take time to visit - Amazing.||June 15, 2016
dorotxy||50||We walked through here and then came back another day fr a second walk through. You can not see it all in once visit. There was about everything you could imagine in the way of fresh foods and prepared foods. Ethnic, local.....just everything.||June 15, 2016
andrew l||30||We strolled around the market on a sat before we had a theatre trip planned. Proper gastro delight with loads of food styles on offer, everything from olive oil to linseed flapjacks. Tasters on hand to try too. Food is ok price but due to it being straight from the farm / hand crafted it is a higher premium than other places. I am glad to have paid a visit to tick it off but once is probably enough.||June 15, 2016
JaniceLACA||40||We went during the middle of the week so not all the stalls were open but we were still able to get some Ethiopian food, coffee, dessert and loved all of it. There are plenty of options for all diners as well as some good take aways like cheeses, meats and candies. ||June 15, 2016
marklG5856VA||50||This is a great market. There is a wide range of food stalls selling a great variety of food from around the world. I popped in for lunch but there are also bakers, fudge stalls cheese and lots more. The street is great. There are British standards such as fish and chips or burgers but if you want to be a bit more adventurous you can try Balkan or Ethiopian. If you are not used to London prices you might find it a touch expensive but you can't knock the choice and the quality.||June 15, 2016
MikeH213||50||The market is jam packed with excellent produce and if you are looking for lunch don't miss out on a visit to Gourmet Goat. I had the very generous £5 salad and roast goat with green chili paste and tzatziki. There is a choice of 2 salads and I really enjoyed the organic wheat berry salad. The goat was delicious and I will have to go back to try the kibbeh and souvlaki. 10/10||June 15, 2016
Gloson||50||Amazed by the variety of cuisine in this market and it really gives me a sense of local food market.Make sure you come really hungry in order to try as many as possible.We went during office lunch hour on weekday so you can imagine how packed it was.Staff in each food booth are friendly as well~~~||June 15, 2016
enci_csopi||50||It is a very unique market with lot of variety from fresh wild mushrooms to venison burgers prepared right in front of you. You should definitely visit on an empty stomach :)||June 15, 2016
West1107||50||After living in Toronto for 4 years, I've been back for a wedding and so managed to plan my visit to include a trip with my best friend before my flight home.I hadn't been since all the changes, but was so pleased to see very little had changed and it was great day out!As my bf works for a very big food manufacturer it turned into a work recci looking for new products!Loved every minute!!Way too much food to sample and questions to ask...but amazing vendors!||June 14, 2016
MichelleO1313||50||This market was a great experience - Different food / Drink stalls - Found some great variety and deserts as well. Well worth a walk through.||June 14, 2016
Marmel||50||This market was amazing! The produce was unbelievable! The assortment of cheeses and breads were enticing; wish we had more time to stroll the markets! Yummy pastries too! If we ever visit London again, this would be at the top of my list to visit.||June 14, 2016
foodblonde||50||There isn't anything you can't get at Borough Market. Easily accessible by the Tube. Fabulous atmosphere, people and food. Very clean.||June 14, 2016
343perryc||50||Awesome spot to grab a beer and just get lost into the markets. The duck sandwich is very obligatory to get. Also go all the way into the back for a scotch egg or even fresh meat pies. ||June 14, 2016
bbbbbbbbbbbilly||30||We went there to look at the life an all the food. Big was my surprise when I saw that there wasn't filled up whit vendors/ sellers. So my big question is this marked past it prime time an on the way down? ||June 14, 2016
862laksmia||50||Enjoyed visit here with my friend, so many foods, cheese, fruit, olives and many many more. A nice place to have lunch and/or coffee, can not stop trying all the foods. Will come again when I visit London.||June 13, 2016
lovechocolatecake||50||Oh, what a wonderful experience. If I'm back in London, this is a must to return to. So many samples to try and we ended up making many purchases. One huge regret is that I couldn't purchase the mushroom pate which is beyond delicious. Circumstances just didn't allow it, but I will never forget the taste.||June 13, 2016
amoore2016||50||Great market, lots of samples. Don't miss the donuts at Bread Ahead - delish! I was so full from sampling that I didn't get to try a pie from Pieminster.||June 13, 2016
PLR59||50||Although I was brought up in London, I'd never visited Borough Market before, and oh boy, what a fantastic experience.The choice of different story types of cuisine, the fresh fish stale, the French style displays of fresh fruit and vegetables, and the most amazing atmosphere. NOT TO BE MISSED||June 13, 2016
AmandaRutter||50||Really enjoyed our visit here, my husband and I decided to grab a spot of lunch and were definitely spoilt for choice. Massive queues everywhere though so clearly shows just how good everything is. I particularly like the exotic meat stall as I'm not able to get hold of this kind of meat where I live. Ended up spending a fortune here in 10 minutes but was definitely worth it, homemade produce by knowledgeable sellers. Always worth a visit if you're in the area. Only thing I would like to see would be picnic tables or some benches to sit and eat. Was really hard trying to eat our delicious purchases standing up with people pushing to get by you. ||June 13, 2016
jwtran||50||Awesome place to sample a variety of foods. We tried fruits, donuts, jerky, jambalaya and many more. Would highly recommend coming here.||June 13, 2016
John T||30||I've only marked this a 3 because when my wife & I visited(Monday) there were only a few Stalls open for business.Very accessible for us wheelchair dependant people although care is needed. A vast range of food and drink to be had when fully open. We shall return with cool boxes a plenty for Christmas Shopping. Borough Market is good and another tick off my bucket list!||June 13, 2016
ipekteker||50||Its such a lovely place with live music and many healthy snacks. You can find almost anything, so many vegetarian options. Also good for food shopping. ||June 13, 2016
Ticklegj||50||A wide selection of food stuffs from all over the world. Local artisan products as well.A good place to goand taste the products on offer then select from the many stalls for lunch, you'll not be disapointed.||June 13, 2016
jolene s||50||It's a good place to stop by in the middle of the day for some quick healthy bites. There are many food carts around that are preparing quick healthy snacks. Lots of shops selling, bread, cheese and other desserts. It's good for locals and tourists.||June 12, 2016
gladi2014||40||love walking through borough market, its full of really great food and drink options for lunch which really gives you a great variety to choose from and to soak up the vibe and atmosphere of the place||June 12, 2016
Mark Benjamin L||50||I was there on a short midweek visit and wandered round all the stalls. So many different types of fresh food which you simply could not obtain anywhere else in London are on sale here. I bought half a dozen turkeys' eggs . I've never tasted these sort of eggs before - but they have proved to be a tasty treat and a talking point with friends . A visit to this place is a wonderful experience for both Londoners and tourists. Thoroughly recommended.||June 12, 2016
Worcester_Sarah||50||We need to visit Spice Mountain to stock up on their fabulous spice mixes, and I'd highly recommend them to anyone who loves cooking Indian/ Asian cuisine.We also wanted a quick lunch so wombled around the amazing food stalls until we'd both settled on what we wanted which was a simple but tasty bratwurst. Pretty much every style of cuisine is represented. Then we walked off lunch having a nose around the colourful food shops in the market. If it's you're first visit set aside a few hours!||June 11, 2016
KrishRagh||50||It's a farm market ... For Indians it's a typical subzi market :). Bakers, chefs, farmers fight it out in the stalls selling their produce and stuff is amazing ... We loved the desserts more because being veg had limited options on good food. There is enough veg ranging from Indian street food, Ethiopian, Malaysian, Arabic ... You name it you have it. All street food at one place and then fresh fruits, cheese, meat, poultry, fish, ice creams, milk shakes and list can go on. It's just that whatever I found smelling amazing was not veg :). But must visit once if not more. ||June 11, 2016
Knowleskay||40||Absolutely amazing. We entered from the London Bridge side and it was like walking into Diagon Alley. We spent quite a bit but we are not from London so this was a one off treat. Lots of breads, chocolates, cakes, fruit and veg smoothies, fish and random food stalls. I think you could eat dinner here for two weeks and still not try everything! Really lovely, very busy, repetition of some stalls but fantastic atmosphere. Warning - you are given testers a lot to lure you in!||June 11, 2016
Jim R||50||We took our family to lunch. We stopped at four different stands and bought something to eat. The Chirzo sausage stand - amazing. Great fish and chips. Pulled pork on a banquette was incredible. Best gelato in London! We also tried cheese, olive oil, vinegar, and sausage. Must do! ||June 11, 2016
Dean_Porte||10||This is a market that is in love with itself and thinks the sun shines out of its backside. It's overpriced and the pretentious middle class trying to compete with upper class go their saying it's lovely and love it due to its connection for having a street in it appear on the Bridget Jones Diary film. Never have I see a market so up its own backside as I have seen in the borough market. Go elsewhere as you will do yourself a favour hugely. Also it's overcrowded. ||June 11, 2016
Fred H||50||Great for lunch, browsing and shopping if you are cooking a meal. Also great to pick up cheeses and snacks for the flight home. Don't miss the bacon buddy at Roast! ||June 11, 2016
trhill21||50||We were directed here on our visit by a friend who lives in London. It is a great market full of local specialty vendors. Great place to spend an afternoon sampling different food and drinks. Highly recommend.||June 11, 2016
ColinP96||50||We love this place, and come here often. So much to see and savour. Enjoy the stalls and then choose a couple of really good value take away dishes to sit and sample. Wonderful experience.||June 11, 2016
Ross W||40||I consistently are here every day for 5 months and I can honestly say I will never have such excellent lunches again. Super tasty and varied means you can sample amazing new food every day.Equally as good summer through winter.The tourist crowding can get a bit much though.||June 11, 2016
Daniela K||40||This is a tourist attraction that is actually loved by real Londoners. The food is incredible with reasonable prices and great selections, both to eat there and to take home. Really fresh produce, great local options, and some really cool imported selections. It is hard to move it is so crowded on a weekend, so be ready. Really convenient to Southwark Cathedral and the Tate Modern.||June 10, 2016
annaemack||50||One of my favourite things to do on a free Saturday in London. Delicious cheeses (especially the Comté) & Spice Mountain is brilliant for any slightly less mainstream spices (we find it particularly useful for cooking Cambodian dishes). The fish wraps at Appleby's are delicious, as is the rackets stall. My favourite at the moment is possibly the confit duck roll. So many delicious things to see & taste! ||June 10, 2016
cathygrant01||40||Visited recently on a visit to London with friends, great place to visit, food stalls are great with foods from all over the world, fabulous choice of cheeses and breads. Good selection of stalls for street food, thoroughly enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.||June 10, 2016
Argonza||40||Although we went on Tuesday that is not the best day. we enjoyed to visit and get food at Borough Market. Multiple options by niche gourmets, and you can either walk around picking to go, tasting the food you like, or get into some of the nice restaurants, and get a more formal meal. Easy to get ( 5 min walk from London Bridge Tube station), and with other attractions nearby (i.e. Southwark Cathedral).||June 10, 2016
yaletowners||50||Short: Loads of artisanal cheese and bread. Jewelry, knickknacks and baked goods. Well presented and fun. Choose to sit or stand for a great variety of quick food. Friendly and convivial atmosphere.Long: We wandered over to the market from the British Museum and really enjoyed to crowds. We sampled meats, breads and cheeses from local vendors, picking up some great items for snacks.There are many to choose from, so look around before you make your choice. If you want a hot meal, you can find plenty of pulled pork and other handheld lunches or you can sit in one of the many "pub" style restaurants that offer a more extensive menu. The air if filled with wonderful and eclectic aromas. The market is large and you should give yourself some time to explore and find your London treasure. Go with friends and soak in the ambiance with some tasty ales on tap or have a cuppa at one of the river side restaurants nearby.||June 10, 2016
mummooshka||50||So many different types of food for any tastes... I couldn't get enough And such a lovely place to wander and smell the food lolFree WiFi in there *fist pump*||June 9, 2016
338anieeb||50||I love food and also trying out different foods from several cultures.. We went on a Saturday. The atmosphere was great, was a nice day outside. The samples and choices of food was awsome. I got the sangria, scotch egg, hotdog and a whole bunch of deserts..from Severa stalls..... I know it sounds like much but hey I was on vacation it's allowed....Everything I tried was great. I would definitely visit again||June 9, 2016
107fawaza||50||You could find good food a lot of homemade kind if food stands for all type of food such as English Japanese asian and middle east food stands most of the food are fresh provided also you could buy fresh fish, meats, vegetables and cheeses. There is also a lot of organic food and drinks.As I am studying near buy I enjoy grabbing a sandwich for lunch. I would say a must pass by location. ||June 9, 2016
Kim G||50||This market was recommended to me and I'm glad I made the trek up there as it was an amazing place to visit with lots of choice and fresh food, there is a lot of local produce and i really loved the spices and oils, there was a cider stall where you can try the different types and lots of sampling of the cooked food for sale, it's well worth a visit||June 9, 2016
apande726||40||An interesting market with lots of exotic foods on offer. Very much like a European street food area. Unlike typical British markets. Worth visiting for fantastic variety of reasonably priced foods and ingredients.This area of London around London Bridge and the South Bank is now very pretty and a major tourist attraction.||June 9, 2016
northernneckinn||50||Don't think I've been anywhere with such eclectic and diverse variety of lunch offerings as well as specialized food stores. The food stands just off Cathedral Street offered every imaginable ethnic variation and you could visit the market for lunch for two months and have a different lunch every time. Just immerse yourself, walk around, sniff the aromas, let your juices droole and dive in! All food vendors seem to have reasonable pricing largely because of the hugely competitive nature of the food to take market. Many other stalls had food to go to take home and cook later, cheese shops galore from many parts of Europe, seafood, breads, produce, spices, wines, and pies!! Just an exceptional collection of food from all over the world - don't go hungry!||June 9, 2016
LeeC4269||50||We visited Thursday in June, we had lunch with several street foods,especially fish and chips in Fish kitchin was the bestI wish there were some more places like benches to sit on to eat. ||June 8, 2016
Arno T||40||Only open at Saturdays.Great for grocery shopping and breakfast/brunch.Unfortunately live too far to do my grocery shopping here but man would I love to buy some camel burgers, other exotics and fish to take home for a nice bbq!||June 8, 2016
Worklaptop||50||A fantastic place , great atmosphere , lots to eat and sample from the stalls. A bustling and vibrant place , I believe one off the rooms that over looks the market next to the railway bridge was used as Harry Potters bedroom in one of the Harry Potter films.||June 8, 2016
adrianl151||50||its very easy to wander around Borough Market taking in the smells, sights and atmosphere. You won't be alone because people watching is only beaten by the quality and variety of food and drink available. Leave at least an hour. You can also pop into Southwark cathedral and nip up the Shard. All very close by.||June 8, 2016
Micheline De L||50||Breads, meats, fish, cheeses, fruits, vegetables are of the highest quality and freshness..Proof....a lot of restaurant owners shop there. Had a delicious meal for less than 6 pounds.....that's a good deal!!!!||June 8, 2016
Rani S||50||My husband always mentioned about Borough market and we had been there several times. It's extremely crowded during weekends,lunch time,u don't get place move or walk. Not to miss there opposite market there is bakery called Konditor and cook,surely drop in from amazing hot chocolate and pastry||June 8, 2016
MajaAmalie||50||You will experience the best mix of a fun and relaxing atmosphere, excellent food and food-culture from A LOT of countries around the world.First time we went was a normal workday which was good, cause there were not a lot of people and we got to have a great overview and had time to fall in love with the place and talk to different 'shop-owners'. Two days after, Saturday, we couldn't resist to come again. There was an amazing atmosphere, buzzing from happy food lovers who all were just enjoying and having fun. If you're in to try new kind of food and having fun at the same time, then GO!!||June 7, 2016
TAMEMBER08042011||50||Saturday AM was probably the busiest time to visit this market, but the crowd just added to the fantastic atmosphere. We went early to get a feel for the place,then took short trip on the river, to return around lunch time. We had worked up an appetite by then,and quickly made our way back to the food fest. Burgers,hog roast,cheese toasties,cakes ,fresh fruit and beer. We shared each offering.....this way we both got a taste ....no way could l eat each item myself as they were pretty generous portions,,,but more importantly they tasted fabby...best street food ever, and you will find something to match your taste. Special mention to mini magoo's.....very helpful and friendly,and got some take away healthy mix to take back on the plane.||June 7, 2016
286iant||50||I'm truly fascinated by the choices of street food available here. Ethiopian, Egyptian, Thai, Mexican......you name it. There are delightful shops selling olive oils, truffles, salts and many more too. Great place for foodies and gift hunters. ||June 7, 2016
andrew e||50||So much to see when you are in the area you might miss it, so take sometime and go. There are so many varied stalls and side streets, places to eat and drink||June 7, 2016
Ziggy A||40||Go there hungry with a pocketful of pounds. Food for everyone, take time to look around before eating, and plan ahead on where to sit as there's no sitting area within the market; I ended up (quite happily though) standing slightly out of range of the rain with my raclette from Kappacasein. Go! Eat!||June 7, 2016
VibrantAurora||40||Came here on Saturday morning and the place was buzzing with foods and people. One of the best flea and weekend markets we have visited. The fresh oysters are superb - 1/2 dozen of succulent ones for only 5.50 pounds ! The coffee is so aromatic that you just cannot miss it! Then there is the aged balsamic vinegar with healthy enzymes and truffle honey... Great stuff! ||June 6, 2016
WeatherNole||50||Anytime we go to London, we always stop by Borough Market. Be sure to carry a lot of money as there are so many different foods to try. We always have a great time here. ||June 6, 2016
Emily S||40||I've loved paying the odd visit to Borough Market since moving to London nearly four years ago. It's pricey if you're after a food shop or any hefty amount of sustenance, but it's wonderful for a little pot of spice here, a delectable brownie there, and a free taste of everything in between. Bonus points for being surrounded by bakeries, coffee shops and cook shops - the temptations never cease! It's at its quietest and best on Thursdays but Friday and Saturday are fine too - just don't leave it til Sunday if you're only around for a weekend. It'll be dead! ||June 6, 2016
niamh b||50||If you've only a short time in London, I definitely recommend a visit to Borough market - it's a really lively spot,soak up the atmosphere and stroll around the food stalls, you can even get a glass of prosecco on tap to walk with, before deciding on which foods you'll eat! My favourite was the 'empanadas'. Close by is the Shard for some amazing views of the city, there is a charge to go to the viewing deck - instead, go to the hotel at the shard (wear shoes), pop up the bar and get a drink and the view for the same price.And finally, close by is the River Thames, its a lovely walk and you'll pass by 'the globe', Tate Modern Art gallery and over the bridge to St. Pauls - so take you pick :)||June 6, 2016
Dimicke M||50||If you love food, you have got to visit Borough Market. What a selection! There is definitely something here which will cater to pretty much anyone's needs, and you'll probably end up rolling out from all the eating. Note though that it is not open on Sundays.||June 6, 2016
tezpil||40||Great Food Market with fresh produce but closed on Sundays. Light and airy shopping experience near The Shard.||June 6, 2016
Katraylor||50||this is my favorite food market in london. Don't go before friday bc most of the stalls are closed. lovely cider and proscutto shops, and wonderful cheese. a must for all foodies.||June 5, 2016
Shanston C||50||Try the curry stand (free samples for those who are wary of the flavors), or simply get a cup of mulled wine before going to a nearby restaurant!||June 5, 2016
Michal S||50||This market is amazing, clean, colorful, the smells are just great, for people who love food, drinks and good atmosphere- don't miss it!Great cheeses, bakeries, oriental food ect ect....Brilliant! ||June 5, 2016
dedicatedtraveller||50||Even if you are not a foodie, walking around Borough Market is a great thing to do. So much to see, always something different to eye up! Great aromas tempting you to try something and the atmosphere is vibrant.You are spoilt for choice if you are looking for something to eat and if you are food shopping you can get virtually anything you can imagine from the market.I love it as a place to peruse even if I am not eating.||June 5, 2016
guavasorbet||50||It was a treat to peruse Borough Market, both the grocery area and the eating area across the street. The only problem is deciding what to consume! I ended up buying some tasty Scotch eggs and venison pies, along with tea and a Bakewell tart. Yummy! Lots of shops and vendors offer free samples so you can munch while mulling over your options. There is a glassed-in area that offers some seats for eating, just wish there were some more seats or high tops. Free bathrooms in the eating area are also a plus.||June 5, 2016
KarpuraS||50||So many great eating options; indian, ethiopian, burgers, cheese, grilled fish, sweets, turkish delights, fruits...this is at the end of london bridge.||June 5, 2016
Timeless||40||Went on the Friday afternoon and Saturday afternoon Saturday was packed glad I went on the Friday as I was able to stroll around at leisure. Had a salt beef bagel from nana fanny's which was delicious also had a brownie from another little stall and picked up some hot sauces and pastes from the Mexican stall all in all a nice place ||June 5, 2016
Jahz418||50||Me and my husband have gone here after visiting the Tower of London and walking on the London Tower Bridge. It was really nice tons of choices of food to choose from the people who sell these foods are great, and quite informative about what you're going to eat definitely going back next time I visit London. And prices are definitely reasonable.||June 5, 2016
Daniel N||50||While a bit removed from the heart of London this Market offers many flavorful locally owned and produced items. Delicious and worth your time.||June 5, 2016
Daniel D||50||This is the best market for food in London, if there is any better then please let me know! We came here on a Saturday, We drove and it's ok to park on a single yellow line at most places in the borough of Southwark. We parked on Southwark Bridge Road which was about a 7 minute walk. But London Bridge underground station is just opposite the market entrance.The market itself is divided into two, one side is worldwide street food and the other is food ingredients more for take home purpose. We arrived here late morning which was starting to get busy, then went to clink prison, came back and it was packed. So top tip would be to get here early morn and avoid getting stuck in popular queues such as Ethiopian and Thai stalls. Quality of food is excellent and caters for many specialities like meat, fish, cheeses, vegan, smoothies. Also we tried a little bit from each stall to avoid getting full too quickly and try to indulge in as many cuisines as we could! Prices are not cheap but not as expensive as London restaurant prices, plus portions are very generous. We loved it, and we'll be back again for sure but the word EARLY is the key...||June 4, 2016
januzet||50||Very nice place, great people and very very good food. I could eat different food from different parts of the world in one place, highly recommended||June 4, 2016
iTravelWow||50||If you love food, go there. I prefer Borough Market over Camden Market. Camden Market is just way to big and I got overwhelmed. At Borough Market you find food stalls with different types of food to sample. Not a lot of places for you to sit and enjoy your food though. They close at 5pm too so go early.||June 4, 2016
roro2202||50||Such a great selection of stalls & places to eat. Wonderful fresh fruit & veg, and unique stalls and homemade goodies. Highly recommended. ||June 4, 2016
AudiSina||50||If sweets, veggie or meat. All you need and love. One of my favorite's places in London City and very central. Absoulety worth it. ||June 4, 2016
Worldlycouple||30||Hated to give it a three, but.... not really a lot there, the obvious tourist attraction is the food, but they really need to provide tables and it could be a bit cleaner. I especially enjoyed the "Bread guys" and their "hard" selling of olive cheese bread! This is a must try, hot and delicious! We tried numerous other dishes such as the hot beef bagel, the vegan Indian dish and the hot dog.... All good, just troublesome to eat! Oh, sample the cheese! lovely and they can vacuum pack to take home!||June 4, 2016
Foxymama1||40||A fab market right outside London Bridge station. It's a food market with literally hundreds of stalls selling all sorts! Great to wander through but does get extremely busy especially at lunchtimes. Better to get there for when it opens. Great atmosphere and great choice of stalls.||June 4, 2016
lauralJ6200XP||50||This place is huuuge! Get a day off and go there to treat yourself. This is the best place for gourmands, either vegans, vegetarians or meat eaters. ||June 4, 2016
Jon C||50||Had a fantastic day walking around the markets, taking in all the sights and smells. Wonderful history, with something for everyone. We got there around 10am on a Saturday, by 11.30am the crowds had swelled so go earlier if you want to browse the stalls with a bit of elbow room.Highly recommend the English wines stall on the edge of the market! ||June 3, 2016
cnicholls13||50||What an amazing choice of food!! We visit regularly and never run out of new things to try. The cheese stalls are particularly glorious. A wonderful way to get the whole family to try new foods...||June 3, 2016
Ian T||50||One of the best markets in London. Some great food, well presented, spotlessly clean and always a bustling atmosphere.||June 3, 2016
alloverTraveller||50||Visited last week on an an extended stay with my wife. Always wanted to go here and was not disappointed. The smells and sights prevail your senses. Salt beef sandwiches from one of the stalls and the sangria at one of the outside bars was worth the visit alone. First class and you need to visit if you've never been. Trust me you won't be disappointed with what's on offer.||June 3, 2016
69u||20||Had an evening meal at Fish KitchenThe food especially chips were raw and not properly cooked. A real pity as they should not get this wrong. If you go there insist that the food is properly cooked.||June 2, 2016
870guyp||40||Amazing food Market with premium products...Spanish and Italian hams...vaste variety of cheese, wines etc...also stslls serving Street food from different countries...A must placd to visit when in London !Ps...some nice Pubs nearby as well !||June 2, 2016

gusssr||40||We made a wrong turn as we were looking for the tube station and stumbled into the market! My GF wanted some food, so we stopped and she got a delicious a Breakfast Bap with black sausage. Yum! I will look forward to going back there and wandering some more! So much food, so little time!||June 1, 2016
LouandPhil||40||We usually visit the market on Saturdays but the last couple of visits have been so crowded it's no fun. As we had some time off mid week we decided to see if it would improve our experience. Bingo, mid week is a much nicer experience. Not a full market but still enough to make it worth while.||June 1, 2016
Aswathy J||40||When you step into Borough Market you are greeted by a plethora of sights and smells of good food...There are so many stalls...so many cuisines...so many things to try...so confusing...So basically walk around the market so that u have an idea of what you'd like to try...dont make the mistake of filling yourself from the first few stalls only to realize later that there was something you wanted to try but you're too full...Its not exactly a cheap place...on an average atleast four or five pounds for most of the main dishes...you can keep on eating...best would be if you can go in a large group...you will be able to try more types of food...You also have the option to buy fresh food...||June 1, 2016
annedI7290RW||50||This is one of the most amazing food markets. Delicious cheeses, meats, olives etc plus an amazing range of food venues providing delicious lunch options. The freshly shucked oysters are delicious!! Lots of opportunities to sample all the produce too before selecting. Great foodie experience!! ||June 1, 2016
Dan1951||40||I am fond of mangosteens, despite their usual high price (but lower here than at Harrod's). I enjoyed seeing the wide variety of products available at this market, including exotic tropical fruits.||June 1, 2016

Jennifer R||50||We visited on a weekday to avoid the crowds and it was great! We found so many different types of food and it was all fresh and delicious. It was a great way to spend an afternoon!||May 31, 2016
wheresthatplaneat||50||My wife, three kids and I enjoyed this market. Sadly we ate across the street at a restaurant. Not because it was bad. But because of the variety of food vendors in the market. Ethiopian, Thai, German, American, soul food. Then there were sweets galore. The kids all managed to find a sweet to take home of their choosing after careful consideration. Lots of upscale food and shops, cheese spices fish, vegetables. I think a must see to experience London culture!Enjoy....||May 31, 2016
Katherine H||50||I love coming to borough market- it's fun to walk around and look at all of the different stalls before choosing and there are a lot of great products you can take home! ||May 31, 2016
Michael S||40||We visited Borough Market in London and loved the variety of food options that it had. We had just got off the plane and hadn't exchanged money yet and only a couple of places take card. We looked around the market and couldn't find an ATM but there are a lot of ATMs just outside on the main road. You can sample tons of cheeses, chocolates, and all sorts of other foods. It is a lot of fun and a nice place that isn't too expensive to fill up on. ||May 31, 2016
paulmgreencvv||50||Always thoroughly enjoy a visit to Borough Market. Tough thing is always deciding what to eat! Recommended ||May 31, 2016
HarryHarris1000||40||Whatever you want, it is here .... there is so much food to choose for, its hard to decide.Lots of tasters too which is great as you can try even more.Only downside is the numbers of people there, on the flip side its great to see a vibrant market.||May 31, 2016
alainabaker||50||If you can find the stand that sells duck confit sandwiches, GET THEM. They're the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. So many cheese, bread, sweets, and savory food stands. I could spend hours here if my stomach could handle it! ||May 31, 2016
crintigger||50||Best adventure in 10 day trip. Cheese and meat and bread and candy and olives and spices and flowers and fredh food....fantastic. Saturday only. We loved it! Two buildings outdiors but covered.||May 31, 2016
Jeret90||40||London is as diverse as a city can get and Borough Market is such an incredible perk for being an international city. Come here famished for all the great food that you could sample.||May 30, 2016
NCTraveler2015||50||This was one of the highlights of my short trip to London. It was a great way to experience London and eat some great food at the same time. The food is really fresh and delicious. You can find just about anything you can think of from ice cream to fruits and veggies to cheese to venison. It is a busy place but a great place to visit. It is a great place for a foodie. So I will be back.||May 30, 2016
Howesthat||50||We visited on a Saturday morning and it was buzzing! It was the first time any of us had been there and after doing a bit of googling we discovered there was a cafe in the market, so that was our first stop for a bacon sandwich to set us up for the morning! After eating, we spent a good 3 hours looking at all of the stalls - some of the things I'd never seen before, like the amazing varieties of mushrooms & tomatoes! The spice stall stood out for me - the products they had were fantastic! It was very busy by the time we left but we thoroughly enjoyed our time there & can highly recommend the ice cream! We wished we could have sampled all of the cakes too! There was so much food on sale from all over the world too - a really interesting place to visit if you like food!||May 30, 2016
Bulla1983||40||I love borough market. It has to be one of the funniest locations you can go in London. The food and drink on offer is amazing. So much to see and taste. One word of warning. If you do not like crowds try to go midweek, very very early. At the weekend the markets gets insanely busy. To the point you will not be able to move or enjoy the stalls and will be pushed through If you do not like crowds do not go on the weekend||May 30, 2016
Mark D||50||Right near the Shard, Borough Market is a budy lively market, when you but amazing food and drink. It also has manus stall to but street food from around the world.You can't visit London without visiting Borough Market.The prices are good too, there is also Costa Coffe, restaraunts and pubs in the area.I recommend the Salt and pepper Chilli Squid.||May 30, 2016
410jeremyj||50||Holy cow, this place is heaven if you like food. Each stand is unique and competes on quality. Literally go into any of them and you won't be disappointed.||May 30, 2016
KarlWiggins||50||There’s been a food market here since Roman times, and as you wander around the market your senses are assaulted by the ever changing aroma of cheeses, fish, Arabic food, hand-baked rye breads, cured meats, dried fruits, olives, flowers, Mexican and Italian cuisines, loose-leaf teas, Ethiopian dishes, high quality roast coffee, Indian street food and a variety of other Kerb Food and spices. There’s even a guy selling Ogleshield cheese from Bermondsey. He sells toasted cheese sarnies on Poilâne sourdough with onions, leeks and garlic. There's also a selection of real ales and wine, with cask ales you've probably never seen before.How can you not love it?||May 30, 2016
PaulaZ7||50||This market is just so, so interesting. The location is peculiar but it works and is on the doorstep of the London Bridge underground stop. The variety of food stalls is fabulous. The food I had here was really yummy. The atmosphere is simply happening and buzzing. I will definitely be back with my friends in tow.||May 30, 2016
Kaz211990||40||We have been to Borough market a few times and every time we have had a great time. There is so much there, lots of things to try! Definitely worth a visit, you won't be disappointed, but be prepared it is very busy!!||May 30, 2016
216jackiec||40||If you are a Foodie, it's a must seeWe went back to see it as the first time we arrived it was late and everything was closed up but some of the small outdoor restaurants were still open and the buzz was fantastic. We were so glad we went back on Saturday morning. It was alive and packed with stalls selling all sorts of food , meat , fish , cheese , veg, baked goodies . You can buy fresh food to take home and cook here or buy cooked food and eat it as you walk around. There are some cafes and restaurants there also . So something for everyone. This is a vibrant market and you are sure to see things that you may not have come across before in the culinary world. ||May 30, 2016
Emily D||50||I stopped by Borough Market for lunch on my way from visiting the Tower of London and was not disappointed. I purchased a steak and kidney pie from Pieminster and it was hands-down the best pie I've ever had. Great selection of artisanal food, especially for the hungry tourist looking for something to grab on the go!||May 29, 2016
Adriana C||50||Wonderful vibrant place in central London, great if you like street food and markets! It is fascinating, entertaining and even if you are not going with the intention of buying groceries you will definitely come back with some super original mozzarella, some baby avocados or a massive slice of baked cheesecake! Obviously not as cheap as a market in the suburbs but the range and quality of the products is impressive. It can be quite overwhelming when crowded so try to go during weekdays if possible and yes, to have lunch before you go it's a crime.||May 29, 2016
Keithl1234||50||The specialty food shops are to die for and so many in one location. Well worth a visit if you are in central London and interested in specialty foods. ||May 29, 2016
les f||30||Went to have a look and get some lunch with visting relations, but very little was open it was a Sunday. The concept is good and if it was all open would have been good. There appears to be a lot of different types of food outlets. We ended up in the Fish! Kitchen, so no big lose.||May 29, 2016
Valerie R||50||No arguments over where/what to eat as everyone can find something! Do a quick survey then hop in a line (some get quite long). So much to taste, everyone can get something different and share.The only downside is that there really isn't a seating area which may prove problematic, esp. with kids.||May 29, 2016
927eds||30||The market has absolutely loads of stalls selling everything you would imagine, mainly food and alcohol. I only spent around an hour at the venue and tried some local cider and kangaroo burger which I would recommend. Only downside was because I travelled on a Saturday it was a bit of a fight to get near to any of the popular stalls.||May 29, 2016
nolanani||30||My sister and I visited Borough Market on a Saturday for a "lunch crawl" even though she thought a less busier time would be better. I decided to go with Saturday because we would be in the area visiting other places. What a mistake! It was a crush of humanity with barely room to walk let alone do a lunch crawl. It was impossible to stop and look or sit and eat. We finally found a nice place to duck into for some wine and a bite to eat, Bedales of Borough. Everything else was pretty much a waste of time. Too bad I didn't listen to my sister.||May 28, 2016
Fionna O||50||We went on a Friday morning in May, arriving soon after 10.00 am when it was easy to move between a great variety of truly excellent food stalls, meat, fish, fruit, baking, olive oils, truffles, a cornucopia of fruit and vegetables, wild mushrooms, cheese, plenty of street food from Indian to Eygyptian, Middle Eastern, vegetarian, sausages or burgers in baps, hog roasts, fish and chips as well as oysters and plenty of other choices to fill the senses. I found great stall called Mini Magoos selling delicious coconut, ginger seed and nut mixes, gluten free granolas as well as other yummy morsels.Another stall sold British produced salamis including a superb Ndjuda sausage made in Sussex. There was gold medal winning Caerphilly, a great selection of soft and hard cheeses from a cheese maker from Bath.Lovely fresh, bright eyed fish.A goats milk icecream stall selling light clean flavoured ices.It made me proud of British production.Much as we loved it by noon it was getting crowded and by 1pm we decided to abandon our plans for lunch as is was heaving. We wandered along the South Bank, instead, past the Globe Theatre, merchant houses, over the Millenium Bridge.A lovely day out!||May 27, 2016
Michael H||50||Good to see, smell and taste food in a convivial atmosphere. The German Deli stall has, for example, great grilled bratwursts with sauerkraut and mustard and ketchup in a roll. The pastry and bakery stalls have great cakes and pastries and the cheese stalls are ace too. Too much choice - but fantastic||May 27, 2016
Natali B||50||A friend had highly recommended this market for food and boy was she right! The variety of food and things to see is beyond imaginable. It was all extremely clean and everyone was soo friendly. This was the best lunch I had all trip throughout Europe (no joke). Please stop by the Colombian coffee place (you wont be disappointed) the coffee is fresh and the best I've EVER had! There's also a small place that sells scallops..oh my you must try! This is also really close to the London bridge so just stop here for lunch before you head to the bridge.||May 27, 2016
Shaun H||40||Well worth a visit, good location as plenty of other places to see nearby.We tried some noodles from a thai style stall, but sadley had been spoilt with added sugar!! So beware if you not a fan of sweet food.On our last visit you could sit around the church and eat, but now, understanderly so, this was not an option.The key issue is the lack of were to sit, some have seatin, a majority dont, so be prepared to stand and eat when using the many food stalls in the market.||May 26, 2016
Oldjack||40||This is an interesting market catering for trendy and different food and is well worth a visit as it is just over the river at London Bridge. You can find some interesting food here not available at your average supermarket. Prices for some items such as wine can be a little expensive but they have a different range of products to seen elsewhere.||May 26, 2016
Robert M||40||Booths and booths of every kind of food imaginable. Fresh veggies and lots of different cheeses and baked goods.Another section of plants and seeds.Make sure to wear walking shoes.However, no crafts or trinkets available like in a US market.||May 26, 2016
dhrenegade||50||Awesome market. Large selection and good food vendors. It is covered so if it is rainy you can still visit.||May 26, 2016
Matthew P||40||Food being cooked, meat and cheese to be tasted, colours of the fruit and veg, fresh fish, to many choices of where to go next, the roof is Victorian by the look. People from everywhere talking different languages, the market has it all. I like to people watch in here with a glass of cider in my hand. fresh ||May 26, 2016

854DP||50||There was no type of food I catered for here! This place is like a hidden gem packed full of food, character & history. Felt like I'd stepped into a Dickens novel! There is cheese, cider, fruit& veggies then there is honey and preserves & spices. Fish of every type and meat, meat like crocodile, kangaroo and if you really must zebra! Truly a fascinating place to visit even if you don't buy anything which I doubt.||May 26, 2016
ShouanW1||20||This market's extremely over-rated. I was very excited when I visited but I exited feeling bored and unimpressed. There are lots of other markets in London but Borough Market is not the one I'd recommend. ||May 25, 2016
Sue B||50||Have visited Borough Market on several occasions. London Bridge is the closest tube station and the market is just a few steps away from the exit. The buzz is amazing and there is so much to choose from and lots of stalls have food to eat there. Have a wander around first and take it all in and sample all the free tasters! Saturday is probably the best day to go but it does get busy. The setting is brilliant as you get a great view of The Shard and The Golden Hinde is just around the corner next to the river and you are also close to the south bank.||May 25, 2016
Shazhill||50||Really enjoyed a wander around this market on Saturday. It is a foodies heaven and is a bustling lively market.||May 25, 2016
Valleyone||50||Borough market is a delight to visit, even if you are not shopping.Dozens of stalls with fresh seafood, speciality vegatables, high end meats and more.Several good restaurants and some delightful food carts.||May 25, 2016
Holden20777||50||This is a great place to just walk around. Fresh food everywhere, and lots of other stuff. Lunchtime is crowded, but it's worth it. Highly recommend. ||May 24, 2016
Ignacio T||50||This is one of the best markets we've visited in Europe. The shops offer fantastic quality and the food carts were amazing as well.||May 23, 2016
Sarah P||40||Whether you are a foodie or not - you can't help but love this place. Despite the ridiculous crowds (try go before lunch to avoid the shoulder to shoulder mayhem) this place is a must-see on your London itinerary. Wild boar to mushroom pate, Egyptian to Spanish, cupcakes to venison - this food and produce only market is a tastebuds haven. Top tip, do not eat before your Borough adventure and try not to fill up on too many samples making you too full to make a wise decision on your meal. You may walk in with a starving stomach, but those empty grumbles will be left nothing short of satisfied.||May 23, 2016
BazChan101||50||I love coming to Borough Market; has a great mix of typical market grocery stalls selling fruit and veg but, for tourists (domestic and interntional) its the street food stalls and cake stalls that will be most interesting. Street food here is typically very, very good, but its not exactly cheap. Here, even the street food has adopted Lonndon prices. It can get incredibly busy on weekends to the point where you can't really move and its really not much fun, but once the majority of the crowds have moved on its a much better experience and any queues to the street food stalls will move quite quickly from then on. Borough Market is definitely worth a visit, the atmosphere is great and you do get a sense of "old london" when you're wandering around the stalls under the railway arches. Its also close to other tourists sites and easy to get to so you've got nothing to lose even if you just want to drop by to say that you've been.||May 23, 2016
710gerrym||50||Stumbled upon bourogh market after visiting the Shard, what a find,the smell of cooked food from all over world is amazing,street food at its best, wish i could have stayed longer,very impressed and will definitely visit again ||May 23, 2016

TejashreeT||40||I was back at the Borough market beginning of May and I once again enjoyed going to the market... you can grab a bite.. look around at different food stuff and wares on display ...one guy sells the most awesome garlic prawn rolls.. I can go there multiple times just for that :-)||May 23, 2016
Keith C||50||What a lovely old fashioned market. There are a great variety of foods available in this very historic market in London. There is fresh fish, meats, cheeses, pies as well as a fantastic variety of fruit and veg stalls.The atmosphere generated via the hussle and bussle of shoppers combined with the calling of the traders took me back years, it's just lovely.||May 23, 2016
TommoNorfolk||50||Whenever we go to London for a few days, the last thing we do is to go to Borough Market to get "provisions" to bring home. What a food mecca it is. OK, it is sometimes expensive, but the quality and variety of produce is amazing. Also, there are so many lovely choices of somewhere to get a meal or a snack. Applebees fish wraps sold outside their shop are incredible, and excellent value.Also, if you are taking food home, do buy some Gloucester Old Spot sausages from The Ginger Pig, and one of their fabulous pies. Full of top quality meat, and good value.||May 22, 2016
Cwwsim||50||We were recommended to visit Borough market by my daughter's friend and were glad we came to visit!There are interesting food to try from different countries. We had the scotch eggs that was super delicious and the runny egg yolks were done perfectly! The pies ministries chicken pie reminded me of the top-notched pies I had in York, definitely ask for mushy peas, mash and gravy to go along with it! My husband and daughter shared a beef burger because they could not resisit the smell of caramelized onions!The sweet dessert section of the market was hard to miss! The cakes and brownies were superb! So was the cookies from Scotland! And don't forget to have a cup of artisan coffee while you are there! You won't miss it, just follow your nose! =)||May 22, 2016
982melissaj||50||Come hungry! You can grab a drink and stroll around sampling some amazing cheeses (my fave) and other fresh foods. Pubs and restaurants surround if you prefer to sit and people watch.||May 22, 2016

scott123fish||40||Yep, if anyone spent their youth being dragged around a busy London market on a Saturday morning by their mother Borough Market will bring back the horror.........However this is a market for the middle classes now with fine food / drinks and a bohemian atmosphere even if it is at eye watering prices. No doubt most the people who frequent such markets now never experienced the squalor of real street markets that were part of every district until the early 90's.It was packed on a Saturday. Pleasant stroll for tourists.||May 22, 2016
alexandra l||50||a quite nice place, original, with good food and nice design. It's just a few meters from Southwalk Cathedral, witch is also worth seeing!||May 22, 2016
mskimberlyj||50||There are variety of food to choose from.Must try fish wrap at The Applebees. simply the best.also there's the baked cheese toast too. yummy!everything is paid by cash, don't worry if you do not have any as there's a free cash withdrawal machine in the area.fresh oysters to be found too.fresh fruits, vegetables, cheese, milk, pastries, bakery, chocolates, and many more.a must go place!||May 22, 2016
isko57||40||The market is Absolutely Amazingly Awesome (AAA) in terms of food that are being catered to all walks of life! The vendors are very friendly and accommodating to the customers locally, nationally & internationally! I had a great time ⌚ with my mate / colleague sampling different food of different countries around! It was a great market but due to lots of people that goes around the market, one should take extra care of their wallets as I was a victim of pick pocket! The police men around were unfortunately not in the scene when that unforgettable experience had happened to me.||May 22, 2016
Richard C||50||Visited Saturday afternoon very busy but great atmosphere loads of different stalls selling alternative foods drinks and high quality produce well worth a visit ||May 22, 2016
HarryTours_Official||50||One of the many many reasons to love the city are its plenty food and farmers markets. Having said that, is it the case that quite a few stand out and for me the most amazing being the Borough market. Located right next to the Themse and charmingly under a bridge this place offers everything you would expect from a decent market. Warm drinks in winter, fresh drinks in summer, local and oriental food, sweets and||May 22, 2016
sazy2014||40||As a {patriotic} passionate Londoner and gourmand, surprisingly, this was my 1st visit to Borough Market and I was certainly not disappointed! It is what I consider an 'honest' purist venue with a vast abundance of the freshest, finest tastiest variety of produce and foods that are clearly, lovingly created ...that makes cooking and eating a absolute pleasure! I love this place so much I would consider buying a property in the locality and would Never Again set foot in a supermarket!  ||May 21, 2016
susie58atWhitby||40||Did you know they grow some of their own fresh vegetables underground in controlled lighting conditions them sell them on the borough market. They sell all sorts of fresh vegetables, fish, meat, cheese, breads, well worth a visit to see and smell and taste all the different foods. Easy to get to off the tube at London Bridge.||May 21, 2016
Marion M||50||This market focussed mainoy on food and wow, what a treat. You will be hard pressed to decide what you want to eat. There are many different international cuisines plus gorgeous pastries, chocolate and artisan breads. The smells and sights tantalise the taste buds. Well worth going out of your way to sample.||May 21, 2016

amydotx||50||I don't have a bad word to say about Borough Market. It has food for everybody, which makes it even more difficult to decide what to delve into there and then or take home as a treat. I would recommend that anybody visiting London takes a trip here because it's such a great vibe! So chilled and so much choice. Love it! ||May 21, 2016
530prashants||50||Its a happening market with lots of eateries, organic food shops, bakery products, sea foods, meats, cheese and much more. The market is set as it used to be in old London and as shown in harry potter. Definitely worth a visit for an hour or two. Don't miss out on the duck confit and ciders.||May 21, 2016
W3634YVsamm||50||Colourful food in a beautiful location this place is great for finding those special ingredients for cooking or grabbing unusual bites to eat. We made the mistake of queuing for coffee (took 20 minutes as they clearly were more into the product than delivering!) but the result was tasty. Picked up a stunning pot of mixed spice that is going to wow my apple pies and carrot cake. Three wrapped coated goats cheeses for £10 was my bargain of the day and now having eaten two of the packs, can advise they did travel well on the train and were one of the best creamy smooth cheeses I've had. Close to some lovely pubs and the millennium bridge it was worth making a day trip for.||May 20, 2016

Catriona F||40||We went for an hour wander at the end of the day. I think there is more bustle here earlier in the day but still great for a wander and to try range of foods from Ethiopian to Egyptian. It's much pricier than nit used to be so be prepared for London street market prices but that said still fun even if you don't spend a lot.||May 20, 2016

londonbos2n||50||Foodies know that this is the place to get exotic mushrooms, spices, truffles, etc. but there is something here for everyone. If you aren't into trying strange food (love the goat's milk icecream) there are fruit stands, baked bread, cheeses and many many amazing sweets. My favorites are the fresh watermelon juice and the truffle cheese. Wonderful sites, sounds and mostly wonderful smells. ||May 19, 2016
Nicbug85||50||Went to these markets on a recommendation and they were fantastic. The food is amazing! One of London's best secrets and great for lunch!||May 19, 2016
Gareth B||50||The market is predominantly a food selling market from everything from pies to paella, Indian to Thai etc. Everything is their and the food is gorgeous. Also has specialist cheeses and lots of others. We went on Saturday midday and it was busy. Nearest tube station is London Bridge which is 2 mins walk to the market. the Shard is also close by walking distance. ||May 19, 2016
Rozgoesonholiday||40||Visits to London are incomplete for me without a trip to borough market- excellent for food and cooking lovers! Lots of variety and things to try- the salt and pepper chilli squid is a must, and the macarons rival even the most expensive patisseries! Well worth a trip. ||May 19, 2016
Cherissefleming87||50||If you can get yourself down here , there are so many different foods to fast my recommendations are Roast on the go (pork with cracklings and apple sauce ) ........ Amazing Bread ahead - ANY of there donuts are worth it filled to the brim and amazing And just see what's there is a great little find in London I think and right by the tube station so that's always a plus because you can't get lost :) ||May 19, 2016
AngelFergie||50||We hit the market on a Thursday afternoon and it wasn't too crazy. We got the grilled cheese, cheesy potatoes, bratwurst, an eclair, cookies goat milk ice cream and a tart. It was our early dinner and was much cheaper then eating at a restaurant. All were delicious but the grilled cheese and ice cream stood out the most. My husband loved the eclair. Definitely pop by if you have time and enjoy the local food. ||May 19, 2016
Craig_Tapper||50||I came across this by accident but had a lovely hour wandering around looking at all the speciality shops selling stuff that you only ever here about - speciality cheeses, pork pies and pastries, oils, meats, artisan breads, truffles in all shapes, forms (e.g. oils) and sizes and seafoods of every possible format. Wonderful atmosphere and a great place to just wander and be amazed - or to try the food (not cheap but unique). Easily accessible via London Bridge tube stop too. ||May 19, 2016
anatomic||50||Happened upon the market after waiting an age in line to get into The Breakfast Club with no success and growling tummies. We were looking for somewhere else nearby and saw the bustling market and were draw in. Tried argentinian pasties, turkish coffee, Shetland calamari and fresh lemonade. Fantastic and decent prices. Very very busy on a Saturday morning. But loved the bustle.||May 19, 2016
Brit-Born-Cyp||50||A great way to spend a few hours enjoying all the sights, smells and sounds. Or just spoil yourself with all the choices for lunch. It does get hectic with visitors but worth fighting against the crowds.Easy access from London Bridge underground makes visiting easy. ||May 18, 2016
Mon59||40||Delicious Salt Beef Bagel from the vendor under the bridge (where many ethnic foods are sold). We also tried the salted caramel honeycomb donut and lemon cream-filled donut from BREADAHEAD. Awesome.My daughter had the Veal Burger from the stall in the Marketplace (which also sells paella and malaysian curry) and it was juicy and tasty. Stand-up eating only. Love this place! ||May 18, 2016
Madhumbe||50||One the oldest markets in London. A busy market with plenty street food , breads, cakes, cheeses and wines to name a few. Great variety of fruit and vegetable. Visit when the whole market is open from Wednesday to Saturday. (Some of the stalls are closed Mondays and Tuesdays||May 18, 2016
Gabriele1989||40||We visited the borough market on the first day just after our arrival in London. The market is very close to London bridge, so i would simply stop at that underground station and take a short walk.The market offers a wide choice of food, stalls and tiny shops for every liking; it took an hour for us to just decide what to eat, and soon after we were done eating we found other dishes we would have loved to try. Prices are fair for most of the food offered, and i would suggest to visit only if you have a few hours, in order to really enjoy it. It gets very busy at lunch time. ||May 18, 2016
canada_rocks1||40||Really easy to get to from London Bridge this is worth stopping off at for lunch and to have a wander around. Lots of different types of food to try.||May 18, 2016
Tom N||40||great market to visit best market in south London i love the market, excellent food fab pulled pork cobs always worth a visit!||May 18, 2016
wpaul75||40||Huge food market under the railway lines, for meat, artisanal baked and dairy goods as well as take away food. Definitely worth a visit. Large selection of different food specialities to take away or eat at the place.The retail market operates on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 10am to 5pm, Fridays from 10am to 6pm, and Saturdays from 8 am to 5 pm. ||May 17, 2016
OzeRichard||40||Historical part of London thats well worth a visit. Can try all the different types of food available in this great city. Very busy place that is off the usual tourist path but well worth a visit and subsequent walk along the riverside.||May 17, 2016
Quinnscommentary||40||Food, food, food and best jelly donut in the world. I found it fascinating and could spend a whole day eating my way around the world ||May 17, 2016
181reneej||50||My husband and I first encountered the market on a weekday and were immediately charmed. We enjoyed a wonderful seafood dinner at Fish! Sea bass and cod were both delicious. We also visited on the weekend and braved the crowd to get a delicious bratwurst. Lots of interesting vendors, food, and other items. Definitely worth a visit!||May 17, 2016
Hailey G||50||I came to the market on a recommendation from some Londoners I met in the States, but a lot of locals I've met since don't necessarily know about it. SO delicious, great variety of foods, both cooked and things like bread/cheese, different cuisines, in an interesting and historic spot. Bonus are the bars along the fringe where you can plunk down with your couple choice items from the market and have a beer and people-watch. Very convenient location as well. ||May 17, 2016
Hila_82||40||A great food market, lots of different food stuff, fruits, drinksAnd lots of people and good vibesBest walk around and taste from whatever excite your heart.A bit expensive but if you want cheap, go to a suppermarket...||May 17, 2016
yannis y||40||Interesting offers, but no stalls to eat on the spot; you can only buy to cook at home or eat standing up.||May 17, 2016
Cassyt||50||Incredibly crowded, but we bought a couple of mimosas and soldiered through the crowds. Everything we tried from cheese to salumi to olives to focaccia was simply fresh and delicious. Word to the wise, the bathrooms are incredibly minimal and there is always a wait.||May 16, 2016
Joanne L||50||Tried the Taro Dibs (which were so-so, good nutrients tho) and Scotchtails (which were to die for omg) and fresh oysters with sparkling champagne from Richard Haward (yummers!!!)There were so many other foods though, fresh produce too. Wish I could go there everyday! Not to be missed! ||May 16, 2016
rAchelCairnsss||40||Just walked through here after having breakfast at the Shard. Very cool place with tons of options to eat. Unfortunately did not try anything bc we just ate but still really cool to walk around. ||May 16, 2016
denise2113||50||Absolutely worth stopping at this market! It gets packed so I recommend going early! The food, cheeses, mustards, fresh produce, fish, etc..... Just amazing!||May 16, 2016
stone c||50||The selection of food is amazing. Ideal place for Saturday/ Sunday Monday brunch and groceries.Shame I got there at four when most shops were closed, but the food stalls were phenomenal.10/10 would come again, especially for the roast hog (yes they give you cracking) - see photos attached.||May 16, 2016
adilpolat||30||It's a nice and entertaining place. You can find ny kindoffood, even crocodile burgers! Best way is going there with subway, take thelondon bridge station (not burrough station)||May 16, 2016
r2grandsons||50||Had a great time looking at the different food types in the market. Visited the market on recommendation of my son we were not disappointed the hardest thing we had to do was decide where to eat on one of the stalls and buy takeaway or in one of the many cafe/ restaurants||May 16, 2016
Peter G||40||Luckily we got here around 11.00 on Saturday morning, it was busy but not packed (yet!) Went to an outdoor grill place called Hash for breakfast, it's near the London Bridge side. The food was delicious, gumbo and a breakfast baguette with bacon, chicken, salad and a selection of sauces, tomato, chili etc. Came to approx. £18.00 for the food and two drinks. Friendly staff and the food was delicious, would go again. Great atmosphere and large selection of savory foods: Egyptian, Indian, Thai, dumplings, burgers, veggie & vegan options also. It all smelt amazing! There were plenty of coffee, cake, biscuits and bun stalls too. May have to join a long queue depending on what time you go, Go early to avoid the crowd. People watching in a pub/cafe nearby is a nice way to pass the time. Lots of different nationalities doing their thing. Worth checking out.||May 16, 2016
Meghan R||40||The food here is great, lots of tasters to try and nothing is overpriced or too expensive really! Give the breads a go or the brownies, they're lovely!||May 16, 2016
Hugo D||50||Quiet and experience with lots to enjoy. From food to drinks, oysters. Cheeses and every corner to admire for its look and history . A good walk that takes you to london bridge or southwark and other places||May 15, 2016
Yannis K||50||My wife and I was staying further up Southbank and went for a walk to see some of the sites and came across Borough Market. Rather annoyingly I have booked a restaurant for dinner that evening before arriving at the market which I hadn't appreciated would have so much freshly cooked street food available!There is food there and fresh produce from all over the world! We could have eaten paella, curry, squid, burgers, the most impressive looking hot dogs I've seen ever, amazing sandwiches, cakes, sushi, pork pies, beers and wines from around the world... the list goes on! This place was awesome but you have to go with a pocket full of cash (no cards mostly) and an empty stomach most important of allPersonally, I cannot wait to go back much better prepared!Also, just outside Borough Market is The Shard and it's also near London Bridge station. There's a few banks just outside the market if like me you don't turn up with any cash.||May 15, 2016
Anna D||50||very popular among the locals and tourists. if no interest for the fresh food (which might be a bit higher in price, but there are some delicasy it is not easy to find in the next-to-the house grocery. My friends brought me there to have a lunch (awesome fresh burgers!) recommend to visit and enjoy the atmosphere.||May 15, 2016
184sinemg||50||A bazaar where you can never see eny replication of it. Very fresh vegetables, very unique sweeties and homemade soaps. Also there is a beer hall, it is very bohemian. But ask before buying something because it is a little bit expensive.||May 15, 2016
DJvancouver||50||The food here is very good. Great place for lunch. The scotch eggs, pasta, and custard filled donuts were great. Had to go back twice so I could try everything. ||May 15, 2016
Kam P||50||Love visiting the market especially in the summer months. A place to enjoy the free tasters of food, cheese & drink while stocking up on home supplies. Pimms & prosecco by the glass and bottle also available.||May 15, 2016
RonnieHaham||40|| clean and many food option , so in same tour of the bridges , the City , the churches and some museums it can be good option to have a break with lunch. its near to Winchester palace, the old prison , the Hay's gallery , Shakespeare Museum .. so its all can be no more that half day . ||May 15, 2016
Dinodinosaur||30||We came a bit too early as most shops were not opened until 10:00. If you can, go at 11:00 instead. There are interesting fruits at the market but it could be inconvenient on a rainy day as there are parts that's not covered.The pulled duck sandwich was good but also very salty so just get one to share.I personally don't find it very interesting as it doesn't feel like a farmers market to me. Things that they sell are a bit touristy and versus authentic things from the farm. It's London after-all.||May 15, 2016
Natalie S||50||If you want diversity with food then this is the place to go. Food choices range from Paella to kangaroo burgers, from chicken wraps to gyozo dumplings and cheese to duck!! Don't forget to try the salt beef and a spot of cider too!!! ||May 15, 2016
JillRika||40||You can find variety food at Borough Market, and I recommend you to try pulled pork burger and sausage, and do not miss the monmouth coffee if you are a coffee lover!||May 14, 2016
QSM42||40||This is an especially good place to visit on a nice (i.e. dry) day so that you can make the most of the open air stalls and eating options, although that's not to say that it wouldn't be a good place to go on a rainy day as much of it is under cover/inside anyway. The variety of stalls and food is massive, I for one was rather tempted to try and work across the market from one end to the other trying everything! Definitely worth a visit.||May 14, 2016
Readster56||50||Great choice of food to be had there .I last visited in May 2015 and I noticed this time how much the prices had gone up. The cherries last year were £3 a pound. This year is £6 a pound. That's a wopping amount for French & Spanish cherries!!||May 14, 2016
diegopachecot||50||You can find almost anything, all of Europe's and Asia's flavours are in there, wonderful opportunity to enjoy London's multicultural beauty.||May 14, 2016
delaroma||50||Well worth heading over one day for lunch or a snack, coffee, etc. Tons of amazing food vendors with wonderful looking and smelling foods. The stuff I had was excellent. I went after going over tower bridge as it was close enough. ||May 14, 2016
K5700MFsarahf||50||We head to Borough market for two reasons: 1) To get the best fresh ingredients when we're cooking a special meal 2) To enjoy the incredible range of street food on offerThe place is a culinary sensation and you really must visit if you're a tourist or a local. They have a great range of fresh food, street food and treats - something for everyone! Don't miss out!||May 14, 2016
HillsRen||50||I love this place, great street food as well as great fresh food to buy. I love the fresh fish and the brilliant mix of the best produce. The cakes go straight to the hips but who cares. Fresh oysters, the best in London. This market has a great buzz with a great mix of people. Well worth a visit. ||May 13, 2016
wingate||40||I had no idea about this place till I saw it on Tripadvisor.Always thought that these sort of places only existed outside of London.A large variety of foods wines on sale.They all look interesting but expensive.Game at twice the price in Selfridges.A pork pie at £6 as against £1 in the local supermarket.A packet of seeds £2.I presume that the cost of stalls must be quite high but I am not going to pay those sort of prices.Good for window shopping so to speak.||May 13, 2016
BobHolman||40||We were so befuddled by the sheer choice of all the foods, that we had to seriously take stock and start again - with a plan.Once we had a plan, we searched amongst all the stalls and came away with some amazing foods, some of which we've cooked and used already. They were utterly delicious.We'll be back.||May 12, 2016
Hightower39||50||I love a walk through the crowded market with the sights, sounds and smells bringing your senses alive. The trains rattling overhead on the railway above add to the unique atmosphere this place enjoys. It gets crowded so give yourself time to pick your way through and do try something from the stalls, I have always managed to find a stall selling something I've never tried before, love it!||May 11, 2016
ndugu76||50||We met at the market to have lunch with friends and always the market was bubbling with life.The market had put on a special event to celebrate St George's day and with the London Marathon also happening just across the river there was a real buzz.There is so much to choose from in the way of food and extras and you will never be bored at this place.||May 11, 2016
jspburke||50||If you're visiting the city of London like I did in November 2014, Southwark is worth a look around and especially this market. Me and the wife went here every morning for breakfast during our visit to London.||May 10, 2016
Vixster28||50||Took in the delicious smells despite it being a very busy Saturday. Sampled a salt beef bagel which was devine! Go there hungry! ||May 10, 2016
Keith G||50||Borough Market is an exciting place to visit at almost any time but it is at its busiest around the lunch time period. There would appear to be a vast range of foods to buy and take home. Equally there are many places serving food to eat ‘on the hoof’. Close to London Bridge station, the clink and Southwark Cathedral; it is easy to get to and there is so much more to see in the area.||May 10, 2016
EuropeanJ||40||Every time I visit, there is something new which makes you keep returning. Do go with an empty stomach in order to try different things.There is a good coffee place right outside the market which is also a must go but the queue could be long.||May 10, 2016
Suzanne N||40||Great spot to pick up outstanding local foods for brunch or a picnic. Fun to walk around and look at all the gorgeous produce. Don't forget to check out the small but beautiful Southwark Cathedral behind the market towards the river.||May 9, 2016
Farmps||50||Love Borough Market and have been there many times but on this occasion I took my friend who had never been there at all! The atmosphere ,food and samples are first rate!The variety of food/drink is amazing!My friend couldn't believe that she had never been there before.We spent a good 2 hours just wondering around trying the samples and buying the most delicious cakes!This is a must see in London!||May 9, 2016
JDuong27||50||A really good walk from visiting the Tower of London or the Iconic tower bridge (or both). This market was filled with both tourists and locals. Pros: Such a good mix of cooked food, sweets, breads, spices and more. I would recommend trying the fish & chips, cookie, olive breads and Scottish eggs. Cons: Not really a sit down and eat place, you will need to eat most things on the go. Can be a little difficult for those with kids. ||May 8, 2016
JenniferByrne1986||50||I love Borough Market. It has been a staple of my London life since I arrived here seven years ago. It's a great place to simply absorb the sights and smells of the world with plenty of freebies to absorb the tastes too. Great restaurants and pubs nearby too. ||May 8, 2016
linbinpin||50||We visited here at lunchtime on a Wednesday. Quite busy but easy to get served without too much waiting. Loved being able to sample so many different types of food. If you do go make sure to try the truffle honey (at the truffle stall) - amazing flavour! (I mixed a teaspoon of this with fresh goats curd and chopped strawberries for breakfast - gorgeously delicious). ||May 8, 2016
Marwa Z||50||I can definitely say it is one of My favorite places in Londondifferent food from different cultures all over the worldIt absolutely Worth a visitit was an amazing experience ...even better than what i expected||May 8, 2016
John S||50||First time we have been here, what an amazing place, even if you don't need anything, it is a must place to visit. Food from around the world and local stuff. Eat on the hoof , plenty of stalls to choose from. It's right opposite London bridge Underground station, can't miss it. Go on, be devil||May 8, 2016
markmywordManchester||40||If you are passionate about food or want a visual treat then this place is for you. It is easy to get to, right outside London Bridge tube and is situated in a railway bridge as you can hear the trains passing overhead, you will be amazed at the variety of food. There are huge selections of fresh fish, meat, cheeses, breads from all over the world. If you can think of it, they have got it and the stall holders are happy to provide samples with the possible exception of truffles. A lot of the produce is organic and artisan, it is not cheap and you probably would not do your weekly shop here but the quality is first class.The sellers make a huge effort in the way the produce is displayed and it is a real treat to take it all in. There is probably a 50 / 50 split of stalls selling food and places where you can also eat. There are also plenty of restaurants in the immediate vicinity and you are also in a good area to wander around eg London Bridge, the Shard, Southwark Cathedral and Shakespeare's Globe Theatre are all nearby. Well worth a trip.||May 8, 2016
whereverlaymyhat||50||I stumbled across this market last time I was in London and was so excited. There was just so much food from different countries I couldn't try it all. Great vibe, great and unusual food, mostly organic and healthy (I say mostly there were some very nice cakes etc!). I am heading back to the UK this August and will definitely be going to the market again, highly recommend it for lunch or just exploring.||May 7, 2016
BillKaren||50||We walked and ate great food and walked some more and then sat and watched people. The salt and sweet cookies were sensational. Worth a trip if you have some time at lunch.||May 7, 2016
Taxidevil||50||When in London we always visit Borough Market as it is so vibrant and there are lots of delicious food on sale.One part of the market sells raw food ;meat, fish. The other sells cooked food for lunch on the go.You can also find bread, pastries and cheese.We always visit the chocolate stall for misshapes at £1.50 a bag.||May 7, 2016
Raspberrypanda||50||My favorite place in London! Borough Market is so multi cultural and in a large space, you get to enjoy hams, cheese, various veggies let alone the pastries and food! I come every year to stock up on my spices for my spice cupboard !||May 7, 2016
maz k||40||A great place to enjoy food! Great food from different areas of the world. Recommend the Koshari box: very filling & tasty. ||May 7, 2016
Melanie F||50||A friend told us this was her *favorite* place in London, and now we know why. Great stop for local and ethnic foods with something for everyone. Worth a stop for lunch or a snack. Great wifi and clean restrooms make this place even better!||May 7, 2016
mrmfield21||50||Quite possibly London's best food market. From tiny bakeries to chocolatiers to fishmongers to pie stalls. Borough market has it all. You can have a three course meal for under £10! All in a wonderful, exiting, bustling, aromatic and colourful location! It can get VERY crowded, especially on Saturday. But don't let that put you off, Borough Market is a fantastic foodie destination for everyone!||May 7, 2016
tanidab||50||Borough Market was everything I had expected. Great selection of food vendors and small boutique shops. I had perhaps the best grilled cheese sandwich ever here! Even if you only have an hour to spare while in the city, make it a point to visit this market.||May 7, 2016
U6730HTtonyg||50||Stalls upon stalls of all sorts of sweet and savoury delights. Free samples in most. You will definitely find something to eat and drink. Don't visit on a full stomach or will leave disappointed as there is so much to try and buy||May 7, 2016
Q9649BQchristopherm||50||What an amazing experience,,,the sights the sounds of this old market,,,,,loved looking at all different local and international food,,,,,and sampling different types of food ||May 7, 2016
Tooysko||40||Some keywords on Borough Market:•Quite large, but not very large•Many different types of food•Cheese, ham, truffles, fruit, vegetables, spices and much more•Very expensive•Personally I think Jubilee Market and Camden Market are better because they are cheaper||May 7, 2016
BELMONTIpswich||40||We had just visited the Shard - this market is a 2 min. walk. A very interesting huge selection of food stalls/shops, especially if you like cheeses ! Many places to have a snack.||May 6, 2016
Lightfoothop||40||Big market with lots of stores for taste testing and food purchasesm there's a bunch of pubs along the entrance where you can get a quick bite too.||May 6, 2016
seeukuno||50||so much food from all over the world! really enjoyed walking around and tasting everything - try and ask for a small free sample before buying especially if buying bigger portions. beware though, that some prices may be marked up cos this market is somewhat touristy. try the jellied eels and oysters they r super fresh!||May 6, 2016
usernameishard||40||I got some lunch from the Ethiopian stall, which was one of the most popular. The good was okay, could have done with some more seasoning. Everybody goes on about the sampling but go for lunch and pick up a nice dessert for later. ||May 6, 2016
thomasmH2692TD||40||Great place to be food inspired -in a low key but very genuine and mouth dripping good way. If you can think of it, you would will find it in this massive food market.Only thing is that you have to be patience... You are NOT the only one visiting this great secret! ||May 6, 2016
billymulraney||50||You can find everything you want in this wonderful place!! From mulled wine to Spanish Paella. Also variety of price.||May 6, 2016
D8566JZpaulr||50||We've been to most of the best known markets in London and can say that the Borough Market is the best for food and general atmosphere. It does get crowded but does have a good choice of food. A great place to get an idea about London markets. If you only have time for one market this would be my pick.||May 6, 2016
Trek629545||50||And I would come here everyday to try something new. If you are a foodie this is a necessary stop. If you've travelled throughout Europe it will make you nostalgic for everywhere you've been - patisserie's, boulangeie's, fromagerie's and charcuterie's of Paris, Italy and Spain - not to mention all the butchers, dairy and vegetable vendors and take-away food stands. If you haven't, you can food-stamp your passport all in one stop.||May 5, 2016
Janegreentea||50||We did a walking tour from the Tower of London and Tower bridge over to the South side of the Thames and on to the Globe Theatre and the Tate Modern. Borough Market is located near/under London Bridge, so it was a great place to stop for lunch in the middle of our tour. Many great and unique food stalls. Delicious!||May 5, 2016
EDam9494||50||Lovely to wander through. Many different stalls with everything from fresh fruit and veg to bread, charcuterie, baklava and fresh pasta.||May 5, 2016
beckybA5067QR||50||Go here for food stalls (of all kinds), vegetables, beverages (juices, smoothies, am& spirits) & cheeses. Very busy market with a multitude of prepared food stalls offering cuisines from all over the world. When I went, I tried a Scotch egg (yummy) and cider. Check their site for start times to ensure you don't arrive too early but make sure you plan time before or after to walk along the Thames & explorer the area. Well worth a visit.||May 4, 2016
SallyF906||50||A fantastic place to wander for an hour or two. Loads of stalls selling every type of food you can think of including amazing olives, cheeses and fish and next to that is a stall cooking fresh calamari. Lovely bread stalls and stalls selling products from a variety of countries. Make sure you take some bags and a cool bag - you will buy more than you think. Lots of restaurants and pubs nearby to have a meal if you still have room after trying all the samples.||May 4, 2016
SeeingTheWordFromORD||40||Borough Market is a great London experience and just across the street from the London Bridge tube station. It is fully open only a few days a week and, when it is, it is VERY crowded - but great fun. You'll find food stalls selling hot foods - best grilled cheese I have ever had! There are stalls selling spices, chocolates, pastries, honey, coffee, tea, and jams. When you wander to the "back" part of the market, you will find fresh produce, meats, olive oils, cheeses. Great way to spend an afternoon.||May 4, 2016
00Ma||50||This place is a must if you love everything foodie Its got some great restaurants too Bread Ahead is a great place in Borough Market you can have bread making lessons and they make the best doughnuts ever ||May 4, 2016
Explosionet||50||I really like this market, It is full of different kind of food. Very typical in London. The food is very good quality and I really recommend it.||May 4, 2016
Colin P||50||Love what the designers of this place have done with it, every turn you find another stall selling cheese,oil,fish,meat, flowers etc etc etc There is literally something for everyone and it gives you a chance to buy artisan products crafted with love and attention, something you cannot get from the supermarket.Lunch here is difficult! There is literally so much to chose from! I had a chicken wrap, stunning and fresh! Probably the best market I've visited!||May 3, 2016
alan k||50||Came here on a Saturday after hearing about it. It is primarily a food and drink market which for me is a great thing. This place has loads of stalls that sells food from all over the world so should cater for everybody. There is loads of wine shops and pubs in the area so you can spend loads of time in this area. If in London visit here. Only 2 minute walk from d underground.||May 3, 2016
Brigitte_1977||50||On a great location below the train tracks you will find this food market. It's absolutely great and something you can't miss if you're into food and snacks. The market itself is huge. You can get fine ingredients to take and prepare at home (fresh fish, vegetables, etc.). However, there are also many stands with organic cookies, a ridiculous selection of cheeses, delicious brownies, mouthwatering snacks (from suburb mezze to Indian onion bhajis to Greek goat kofta). Great to walk around, have a taste of this and that. Prices are reasonable and everyone is very friendly. Easy to reach by underground.||May 3, 2016
LeanneB1400||50||What an amazing place, the atmosphere, the hustle and bustle, the smells. The choice of food was out of this world. This is a definite must place to visit highly recommend ||May 3, 2016

SteveHaxey||50||The best fresh food market we have ever seen. Go as early as possible if you want to shop and not be just a tourist. Not a cheap market but full of quality and variety.||May 2, 2016
berni_ch||50||Huge open space market under the tracks. With a wide variety of products, food, and little restaurants. Each one with the owners to explain what you need to know about the product. Very amusing. Crowded but flows. Must have lunch trying a bit of different things. ||May 2, 2016
901wahoo||30||Worth squeezing through if you happen to be in the area. Great variety of foods on offer but prices are high and geared towards tourists' pockets. Not what I would call a "local's" market.||May 2, 2016
mistermarcus1972||50||We travelled here just to eat doughnuts at 'Bread Ahead' (which were amazing btw) however there was sooo much more on offer here. The place is a bustling, traditional and authentic market under the rail arches. near London Bridge Theres something for everyone here, from Vegan food and tea shops to full on hog roasts. We left with a loaf of freshly baked sourdough and smiles on our faces.||May 1, 2016
John S||40||There are so many varied foods from all over the world on offer to eat now or take away.Also the quality fresh fish and vegetables in tip top condition looking too good to eat.The location is under the railway bridges which provides this market with its atmosphere.Prices are very competitive. The best tube to take is Jubilee but don't get off at Southwark wait for the next stop at London Bride.From here its a 3 minute walk and it is signposted for you.||May 1, 2016
inbarbbb||40||Came for lunch. The food was excellent! Loved lemon-cheese cake. Fresh vegetables and fruits. The only disadvantage is that there is no place to seat and eat :( ||May 1, 2016
andrewbr2||50||I often go to this market for lunch, working nearby. It has a fascinating history and is the top fruit and veg market after Covent Garden. Extremely fresh first rate produce. Superb fresh fish from my home county of Dorset or fish from Sussex. Cheeses from Normandy. Lots of street food choice ranging from African to Indian and argentinean. Weekdays are best and I usually go on a Thursday. Great experience.||April 30, 2016
Mandy M||50||An undercover food market not too be missed. I am in love with this place. Super atmosphere with every artisan foodstuff you could wish for. ||April 30, 2016
tan0508||20||Too many tourists and young trendy things wanting to be seen. Good and varied eats, if overpriced!I remember the market when you could buy fruit, veg, meat and bakery goods, with a few artisan chocolatiers and olive purveyors thrown in for good measure, even a few bric a brac and retro stalls. Needless to say this place is now a victim of it's own success.If you are contemplating a visit, go in the morning, after 10.30am it is madness!||April 30, 2016
Mariana V||50||All types of food, cheeses and fresh fruits. Lovely smell of seasonings/meats/sweets. It's always packed so if you have a baby, prefer a sling and leave the buggy at home. Lunch time is always the busiest, I would recommend get there around 11. The market opens during the week as well, with les stools. ||April 30, 2016
Danielle W||50||Go to this market when you're hungry and walk through to sample so many different foods. Everyone is so kind and willing to visit and help. Lots of amazing food to try!!||April 30, 2016
davemcg74||40||We went with friends who suggested visit to the Borough Market. Great place to as amazing collection of food vendors, bakers, cheese sellers , deli foods, meat suppliers, breakfast and lunch options a plenty . Was quite busy as went on a Saturday but worth the crowding as plenty to see and eat and added to overall experience, thoroughly enjoyed our bacon and egg baps, and pork and crackling sandwich with apple sauce as well as a few drinks picked up like mulled wine and some nice cheese and meats for take away for home. Cool place and well worth a visit.||April 30, 2016
KAW687||30||Used to be a favorite place, but is now dangerously crowded on Saturdays, you have to inch through the crowds and the stall holders can charge mad prices. Try a week day as it is worth a visit.||April 30, 2016
Richard902||50||Lots of selections for a tasty lunch or to take something home. I went on a Monday and it seemed not all of the stalls were open, but not a problem. Samples were offered and they were so good. I was really looking forward to visiting here - it was even better than I expected. Miss it already!||April 29, 2016
qarliv||40||It is a mostly covered market with one subject: Food. Time to visit: 1 to 1.5 hour without dinning.You can visit any day of the week. I've found several special places like Truffle products or delicious fudge combinations and a lot of special cheese. There are many stalls, clean, that sell all kind of merchandise for your fridge. There are also many fast food booths to eat on the spot and a few restaurants. For an excellent coffee ☕ I recommend Monmouth Coffee.Overall a nice experience and I'm sure you'll also find a few interesting items. There was also a Chef course taught outside for free. ||April 29, 2016
zoehhere||50||Had a fabulous time here with my teenage daughter - we had come to London for a birthday trip, and decided to visit borough market on our way to the Southbank. I was so excited to find a stall that was selling wild meats such as ostrich, crocodile and snake (!) amongst other delicacies, along with frogs legs and goat; all at a very reasonable cost. We selected a number of different meats, to take home and we enjoyed a "zoo" barbecue!! We also found another stall that cooked the most amazing calamari, which was just to die for! I am looking forward to my next trip to London.||April 29, 2016
armo0102||40||Arrived on a Saturday lunch time, it was very very busy. The choice of food and many different cuisines to buy. I would in future go earlier in the day when I would think it will be quieter.||April 29, 2016
Eric W||50||We were advised to visit Borough Market on our walking tour of the South Bank. We did and wow! An amazing collection of fast food eateries, artisan bakers, cheese manufacturers, deli foods, the list is endless. The aromas and colours were fantastic and it was no wonder that in most of the walkways, you were shoulder to shoulder with other visitors. Unfortunately we had booked lunch elsewhere, but will definitely return to sample some of the produce. Amazing place!||April 29, 2016
Gillian R||40||So much to see and smell and taste! The market is bustling and exciting, the place to be if you're looking for some local eats. Really incredible market!||April 28, 2016
NYCJulieB||50||Borough Market can be frustratingly crowded, but the quality of the food cannot be beaten. To have the world's best cheese sandwich along with fresh fruit and a chocolate dessert, all purchased there, is to feast like a queen. ||April 28, 2016
thscang||50||Borough market is a foodie haven that sells good quality international food. Bratwurst, raclette, pork roast sandwich, moo pies, oysters, pad thai, paella and more! Definitely a good brunch or lunch place. ||April 28, 2016
jonathonq2015||50||I loved everything about the market. There were so many amazing smells, vibrant colors, excellent people watching, and photo opportunities to be had. I will definitely be back to try more food. They give free samples at some booths! Check them all out. ||April 28, 2016
pja47||40||We had a lot of fun browsing through the various stalls, and then had some fabulous food at a place that sold goat kebabs and goat stew. The flavours were fantastic. A regular customer advised us to eat there, and we were very glad that we followed his advice. Absolutely delicious.||April 28, 2016
CMtrips_12||50||We discovered Borough Market many years before it became more popular and never miss going to the Market on our yearly visits to London. My husband and I both enjoy the variety of foods and the ambiance and always pick up good cheese, roasted cashews, salami and bread for a picnic or late snack in our hotel room. The prices are very reasonable and you can see and smell the freshness of all. The vendors are friendly and welcome all to sample whatever they are specializing in. There are now many stalls of prepared foods from Roasted Pork to Stir Fried Rice. Then pick up dessert of fudge, cakes or Turkish Delights. My husband favorite is the Pork Buddy which is filling enough to last him all day and I can never resist the custard tarts. It's easy to get to the Market by way of the London Bridge Tube Station (Southwark Cathedral) and walk under the railway. Mostly you just follow the crowds. Saturday is overwhelmingly busy but worth it. There are side shops (Neals Yard for the queen's choice for cheeses) and lots of pubs surrounding. Visit the beautiful Southwark Cathedral also....just steps away. It's a fun time for any age at any time.||April 28, 2016
KitchenJazz||50||We went to Borough Market on a Friday afternoon, and were immediately taken by the vast range of foods, spices, and drinks. From smaller stands under pop-up tents, to larger stores with fixed locations, the selections were endless, and all seemingly of higher quality. As a foodie, I could have gotten lost in this place for DAYS!. The range of options was spectacular -- from locally sourced meats, to cheeses from around Europe to my personal favorite, Brindisa, which specialized in foods from Spain. Breads, cakes, charcuterie, teas, coffees, spices, flowers, -- the list is almost endless. Some sellers offered samples and everything we tried was quite good. The layout is a bit like a rabbit warren, and it took us a while to get oriented, but it was completely manageable. There are food carts here as well that serve meals -- Ethiopian, German, Middle Eastern, Indian -- you could eat your way around the globe. Although it was quite busy, the crowds weren’t overwhelming. Going on a Friday afternoon I think we were able to avoid the huge crowds here on weekends. We ended up purchasing some things to take back home with us, and some food we would have on our stay in the UK. All in all, I am very glad we went and if I lived in London, I think I would be here every week. I will definitely go back when I am in London again!!||April 28, 2016
jamiemM4765EP||40||I came to check out the market during Christmas and ended up coming back again every couple of weeks. It has two main sections, one is for prepared foods with lots of little stalls, the second part is for shopping where I buy spaghetti squash, wild game, spices and oils. Surprisingly some things are priced very reasonably if you know what to look for.||April 28, 2016
PHE22||40||Just dropped by why in area. Great atmosphere but very crowded. Lives the variety of cooked sausages for sale. Great use of an old fruit and veg market.||April 28, 2016
Btorb713||50||This was highly recommended to me by a friend. I like to explore and try many different types of food and this place did not disappoint. It had so much variety that I had trouble choosing what to buy. If you are in the area I would highly recommend walking through. Also, not a bad idea to go hungry.||April 28, 2016
FSK0000||50||Went here on Saturday morning after breakfast with the thought of this being a regular farmers market. Was I ever light years away from what it actually is. All I can say is wow, was I disappointed that I had already had breakfast....this place is absolutely amazing!!!! Do not go there on a full stomach because everything and I mean everything looks and smells absolutely delicious. If you go during the week it's still great, weekends are much larger with more vendors present. Make this a must.||April 28, 2016
Polly H||50||I've been going to Borough for about ten years now. I wouldn't go there to actually order my groceries or buy day to day stuff, but as a treat it's certainly worth it. You can get to the main market a variety of ways, there are lots of small side streets that filter in from various angles so you can stumble across it while exploring Borough and London Bridge quite easily and while avoiding most of the main routes too.There's a huge selection of stalls to choose from, either produce like mushrooms, fruits and veg, to cold meats and deli items like pies, sausages, fresh rabbit and eggs, through to stalls selling a variety of delicious things to eat on the spot such as hummus, biscuits, sweets, burgers and cheeses. It really is a world tour and if you can go on a slightly less busy day (pretty hard) you can have a great time trying free samples and ogling the more expensive stuff.It's really nice to grab something from a stall and take a stroll down to the riverside or The Golden Hinde or there are plenty of great pubs in the area, expensive but if it's a treat it's such a nice, vibrant place to meet people for an afternoon.There are covered areas but not many places to actually sit down inside the market itself, so be prepared to hover or lean somewhere to eat your snacks, take some handwipes to clean off the ketchup and oil and enjoy the smells and sounds.I have often purchased a few pies and meats for Christmas and there's a great world beer stall where you can buy gifts for the beer lover in your life!||April 28, 2016
Nigel C||50||A great place for foodies, best days Thursday, Friday and Saturday. You will find most fresh food and jams, spices etc that you will need||April 27, 2016
216andresw||50||This is like a hidden jewel in London. Usually you go to London and expect to go to Buckingham, tower Bridge, museums, etc but you may not be considering this market. Error ! Put it right now into your to go list. I was on a Monday for lunch: local people that work nearby go there to have a snack, it's not overcrowded and you get this old English feeling of an ancient market that stayed back in time. For photographers, specially in B&W, a must ! ||April 27, 2016
Fiorella_Italia||50||Borough Market is a great choice to eat and taste all the flavours of the world without spending a lot of money. You can have meat, sushi, cakes, fruits, pasta... everything !I tried some falafels and they tasted very good, then a slice of cake, a hot tea...the food is fresh and yummy.Don't miss it !||April 27, 2016
Lidia916||40||There were so many visitors on a Saturday that it was difficult to walk through the market. It was lovely nevertheless with food stalls and fresh produce. Would love to go back.||April 26, 2016
Edward T||30||Expect to be funneled like cattle through this market as hoards of people congregate here on the weekend. Busy would be an understatement. Health and safety concern would be closer to the truth. The variety of food on offer is good and the prices are on higher end and they could probably charge more given the ridiculous amount of foot-traffic here. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the neigbourhood and a foodie, just be prepared for the crush and some jostling (pushing and shoving).||April 26, 2016
CindyP259||50||Stayed at the Shangri la hotel and this market is located only a few minutes away. Great stalls with fresh and unusual foods, cheeses, spices, fish and meat. Superb street food stalls and smells to die for. Make a point of visiting it's worth it.||April 26, 2016
aapeen||50||stopped here for a snack and ended up enjoying some oysters and wine. definitely recommended. a variety of food available.||April 26, 2016
cmyk_br||50||Read about the history of the market and enjoy wandering through it. There are some great restaurants. The market is 100% open Wed. - Sunday and partially open Mon/Tues. It's closed on Sunday. Get there early to avoid the crowds.||April 26, 2016
Ronan M||40||Spent a half day here with a great breakfast and lovely fresh coffee. Lots of food stalls selling all kinds of food and speciality items. Go early on a Saturday as it get fairly packed as the day goes on. Top tip buy one dish and share and you will get good value and get to taste a variety of dishes. Prices about 7 pounds per dish. Close to Tower Bridge so you can walk off the calories after.||April 26, 2016
Bryan R||50||A wide variety of food and drinks in a very cool atmosphere. If you aren't looking to buy food to take home then just walk around, try some free samples and enjoy yourself! ||April 26, 2016
AndrewWoodBangkok||40||Great atmosphere; great food; wide variety. We tried the Ethiopian food; Fish! for fish and chips; Turkish cakes and a few samples on offer. Came away very full. We had not eaten breakfast and did not need dinner. This place gets better and is also getting very popular. Go early because it gets full.||April 25, 2016
ABjt33||50||We really enjoyed going to Borough Market, near London Bridge. So many various things to eat, lovely buildings, lovely people, even more perfect thanks to the good weather!||April 25, 2016
Care4you43||40||An early visit is advisable, less crowds and the stalls all setting up their wares. The stalls are full of fresh produce and a lot of tempting restaurants and cafes to have breakfast.||April 25, 2016
June J||50||We love going to Borough Market, some great fruit, Veg, cheeses and especially the array of delicious smells of foods being cooked, from Curry to Paella.Its an extremely busy market and at times its hard to walk around, but that adds to the whole experience and we never fail to go and sample the great food.||April 25, 2016
CardiffCharlie||50||Such an amazing array of different food types. We went on a Sunday & there was live entertainment which just added to the great atmosphere. We had the Pad Thai from Khanom Krok stall & I have to say it was some of the best Pad Thai I have ever had - just delicious. We also sampled the baklava & Turkish coffee which was also very good. A really great place for a mooch and some lunch.||April 25, 2016
Hollypal||40||An reasonable meal which was not overly expensive considering its position. A whitebait starter followed by beer battered fish and chips. Staff very friendly and efficient and overall experience enjoyable||April 25, 2016
LondonEbay_Queen||40||Bustling undercover market with all kinds of produce. Some of the stalls were giving out samples to entice you, and it works! If you fancy a hot meal whilst there you have loads of choice, very varied, smells amazing. Prices aren't any dearer here than in most town centre coffee shops, despite the produce being more artisan in nature. Beautiful cakes, pastries and sweets, huge selection of cheeses and meats, fruit and vegetables. Been here a couple of times and its always very very busy. If you're nearby in London on a Friday or Saturday the food market is definitely worth a visit.||April 25, 2016
Jules0131||50||We arrived after midday and it was heaving. The weather wasn't brilliant so that maybe why a lot of people headed to the market. Most of the stalls are undercover which is great with our unpredictable weather. We were a group of 6 and trying to stay together was a challenge with that amount of people.The stalls were really terrific, it's a good thing I don't live in London as I would spend every weekend here. We bought bread, Olive Oil and Balsamic vinegar. There were many Cheese stalls and plenty of places to eat.I think getting here early is key and arrive with plenty of cash and an empty tummy.||April 25, 2016
610kail||50||I lived in London for over 5 years, this is the place i used to come for that ooooooohhhhhhhh factor. This is always something being cooked, delivered, served or sold that will tantalize your senses of smell and sight.||April 25, 2016
a2afelipe||50||Went on a Saturday with the main goal of not having lunch but enjoying a mixed variety of small gateaus, pastries, etc. You can find from Thai noodles to Argentinian empanadas and do not leave without tasting a few brownies (available at the back at, pretty much, any stand). Big advice: Bring cash and don't expect to be seated or to have lots of space. If with kids... avoid the trolley. ||April 24, 2016
Holidaylover186403||40||Completely spoiled for choice at the vast array of quality food on offer here. We loved our marinated chicken sandwiches, cooked on the fresh on the grill. The only downside is, as others have said, it is soooo busy and not easy to see some of the stalls. Would love to go back in quieter times.||April 24, 2016
Sarah M||50||Do love visiting this market, loads of choices on food to try and buy. Is busy but a great atmosphere. Usually use the opportunity to stock up on my olive oil and balsamic vinegar as the range is so much better than anywhere near me. The food stalls are always busy but most of it is yummy.Love the London markets and would say always good to visit.||April 24, 2016
Yipun J||50||Loving here, lots of local yummy food, organic fruit n veggies and cute florists, good for chilling n shopping, closed on Sunday. ||April 24, 2016
fizz-mc||40||Busy market with mostly food stalls. There is a great selection of things to try from sweet to savoury and vegetarian options. It was a fun way to spend a morning having a walk around.||April 24, 2016
badten16||40||I like the food stalls are so close to each others and they are all friendly to people even though you don't really purchase anything(but you won't!)||April 23, 2016
SilverFlight168||30||I am not a kind of guy who likes trolling in markets. This one is no exception. I found it to be too busy to navigate happily. After 2 visits, I am pretty sure that this place is to avoid during rainy or cloudy days as it is not entirely covered. Be prepared to stand and eat because there weren't that many seats around. The smoke and smell could be bothersome too. Otherwise, there were great food there to enjoy.||April 23, 2016
mheibler||40||The food at Borough Market is great! It's a great place for locals to buy produce and artisan food, as well as a great place to get street food. Avoid on the weekends, it's super crowed and there's no place to sit. Also not the best on very rainy days because there's little cover (but even in the rain, the food is great).||April 23, 2016
cdkeivit||50||Borough Market is a must do for any foodie. Several dozen vendors selling a huge variety of cheeses, sausages, exotic meats (including zebra, camel and alligator), sweets, and bakeries.We ate before we explored and that was a mistake. There are 8 or 10 eateries inside the market but keep in mind these do not have seating, so you have to carry your lunch around!! Many vendors will give samples - cheese, olives, chocolate, meats.Allow a couple hours to fully explore, but be patient as the place can be very crowded. However, relax and take in the smells and sounds of this London gem!||April 23, 2016
Carlos Gustavo M||50||Located under a bridge, this food market host good quality food from all corners of the world. Great place to go food tasting, hopping and shopping.||April 23, 2016
Allan2212||50||good food selection and price are cheap. grab a quick bite. plenty other choices like bread, cheese or local products.||April 23, 2016
BobB214||50||A 3 minute walk from Tower Bridge underground station this showcases some great cheeses, meat, deli products, breads and cakes. We arrived @ 9am on a Saturday to find stalls setting up and the first tourists and shoppers arriving. By mid morning it was very busy so choose which will suit you best.The stalls provided an amazing spectacle for the eyes and the nose. Some may be a personal taste but the variety and quality was a real pleasure to enjoy. Definitely worth an hour or two with some good traditional pubs open early facing the markets.||April 23, 2016
Dork_Knight||50||Obviously, as with any large open-air market (not withstanding the roof over most of it) a HUGE amount of the stuff isn't for you. Veal, beef, parmaggiano reggiano, whatever. Don't worry. It may be slightly off in a corner (depending which entrance you used) but the vegetarian stuff is among the best in London. Honestly, it is deeeeeelightful.||April 23, 2016
Sus1952||40||This is an interesting market squashed in at the side of railway tracks. There are a large number of exciting food stalls which are worth trying. It is a bit dark so if you want a sunny spot go elsewhere.||April 22, 2016
Ashley E||40||While most people go to borough market to shop. I highly recommend just going to eat. Its normally pretty crowded, so go early in the mornings is you're just wanting to go browse. Everywhere you turn there is some interesting food being offered up. I recommend trying the Salted Beef Sandwiches right in the center. So yummy!||April 21, 2016
Sabina_Munich||40||Very nice place - a little bit similar to Viktualien Markt in Munich.There is, as we have been told, a fix part of the market and one that is there only from Wednesday to Saturday. You will find there great bread, cheese, honey and whatever your stomach desire. You can grab there lovely coffee or juice or simply something exotic to eat. Unfortunately you will not find many places to seat. And you should be carefull: if you sit in the area of a restaurant or a bar you will have to buy something to dring or you will have to leave.The seller were very friendly and explained a lot about there products and you could try almost everything.I would recommend it both for a shopping tour and for a walk if you like nice smells and to have something for the eye.||April 21, 2016
kpage2015||50||Just outside the Tube or British Rail stations this is a great market if you are an adventurous eater and even if your not. Exotic and simple foods available. Plenty of edible treats for the kids. Great seafood edible were you stand, oysters, whelks, and we even tried jellied eels. Much better then the name sounds. Numerous restaurants and pubs surround the market. 10 minute walk to the Globe.||April 21, 2016
Easel1973||40||A fantastic market full of fabulous produce with multiple samples available, plus plenty of food available to be eaten on the go, you have everything from the exotic to the standard if in London and you need to get some food and have a spare hour pop in here||April 21, 2016
udizzz||40||great market for foodies.a great variety of food from all over the world.gave to emphasis the Colombian coffee which is fruity and unique .very enjoyable .a must in London .||April 20, 2016
Mrs D||50||My favourite way to spend a couple of hours in Saturday morning. Make sure you turn up hungry and eat your way around the food stalls. Most things are a fiver or less. In particular the Ethiopian curry is bloody delicious!||April 20, 2016
aahann||40||Ignoring all advice because of trip constraints, we went on a rainy Saturday mid-day and it was really, really packed.There's a nice mix of fish, meat, cheese and other vendors and prepared food stalls. We had some really terrific meat pies.The displays of fruits, some exotic, were beautiful.But it was so crowded, eating was standing up and it was even too packed to take any good photos of the food and food vendors.If either of these are important to you (sitting or taking pictures), avoid lunchtime and avoid Saturdays -- just like all the other reviews suggest.||April 20, 2016
juihong||40||Deciding to explore on an empty stomach turned out to be a brilliant piece of forethought. Down London Bridge on the south bank of the Thames lies the Borough Market known for its heritage and pedigree as the best place to enjoy food. The market is a chic place to sample fresh produce and other gastronomic indulgences from cheese, wines, ice-cream. The modern facade greeting you as you approach the historic @boroughmarket hides the fact that the market has been around here for more than 1000 years.||April 20, 2016
rol251||50||When u r in London def worth going,.... Don't forget to bring cash,. The food is delicious and whatever u r graving for you will get it. Market is closed on a Sunday remember to plan it in for one of the other days... After the market u can walk along the Thames via Tate Modern.||April 20, 2016
Danny P||40||A busy market but worth a visit if you like alternate food and drinks. Lots of tourists and you can smell the different sorts of food which are being preparred.||April 20, 2016
TeriF_11||50||This is truly a very old and beautiful market. There are stalls of fresh vegetables and condiments and restaurants of all types. There was a lovely cooking store inside the market too. They had a stand of all types of salt from all over the world. The Oysters are fresh and very reasonable. In back of this market there is a bakery where lessons are given in the art of baking bread. Very unique -- and don't forget the Olive Leaf Tea. Would go back every week if I lived in London||April 20, 2016
deniseh424||50||A must go for a person who loves food and to actually experience the daily life of a local...the stalls are clean and well kept. It was just an amazing experience. What we did is - we bought one item and shared it, that way we tried about 4 different things :) ||April 20, 2016
shawnathan||50||A fantastic variety of street food from all over the world. We liked it so much we visited again and again. It's an affordable lunch option that kept us coming back. Fresh pasta, roast hog sandwiches, meat pies, Arancini and Paella just to name a few of the wonderful things we tried. With most places between 5 and 9 GBP it's quite affordable for lunch in London.||April 20, 2016
IOMTTChris||50||Wow cool place to either people watch or more importantly eat - lots of stalls with cuisine from around the world !. Most things are a fiver and it's great value - the falafels are amazing and so nice as is just about everything soul food is fab too.kate in the week is best as all the stalls are there.||April 19, 2016
LucyJW96||50||Love to come to all the different stalls and try something new. There really is something for everyone! A must come if you're visiting London.||April 19, 2016
FrankieCully||50||I loved this market. Loads of tasty food, drink, plants and homeware.Mostly food and drink for me.First place I ever tried oysters and you must try the Olive Leaf Tea.||April 19, 2016
FlyGirl_World||50||I went there after a long time. Had few oysters and a glass of champagne. Didn't forget to try Paella too.They have really good ham and cheese too. Best time to go there is 11:30am.Take the borough market exit from the London bridge station. An opened oyster was only £1:50. They are so big. Really good value for the money. ||April 19, 2016
Flom M||50||Loads of different stalls, fun to wander around, good food! We had some breads and cheese that were delicious. ||April 18, 2016
bigcol15||50||We went here on the Saturday of our visit to London , the variety of food from all over the world was here , fresh , tasty , very very busy , obviously this is because the food all over the market is incredible , would definitely visit again ||April 18, 2016
TAIMOOR8||50||If you enjoy the hassle of market as well the colours, and flavours. Then the Borough Market is the right place for you. Whether you go to have a warm meal or grocery shopping or simply wandering around. The outcome will always be positive. Perhaps, you might end up visiting the market more than you had planned. I would definitely recommend it if you are close by.||April 18, 2016
Zippy-Oz||40||What a real treat to experience the wonderful ‘buzz’ and atmosphere of London’s Borough Markets last Saturday. Such a wonderful selection of produce on display, with lots of free samples on offer to visitors. Simply irresistible! I couldn’t resist, and had to buy myself a couple of jars of the scotch bonnet chilli jam, and red onion & ginger chutney from the Pimento Hill stand. That should keep me going for a wee bit.And the colours were astounding – all the various shades of green, red, yellow + orange of the various tomatoes, the large bread loaves, the delicious selections of oils + vinegars (great for dipping with bread), the salumis, and fish stalls, and let’s not forget the chorizo buns being prepared, and paella cooking in the background. All these wonderful smells from the various foodstuffs filling our noses, making our stomachs rumble, and mouths water… So much to choose from – there was definitely something there to appeal to everyone’s appetite.A visit to the Borough markets is well and truly a London ‘experience’, not to be missed - and not to be repeated too regularly (otherwise you won’t appreciate it as much with each visit!)…||April 18, 2016
namistais||50||I adore Borough Market and try to go every time I visit London. It's packed with small-scale producers and you'll find the stall "staff" are passionate and love to chat about their goods. Have lunch, a cup of warm cider, people watch, get the finest ingredients for tonight's dinner and add an amazing atmosphere and experience and you have Borough Market. Just lovely!||April 18, 2016

DofTW||40||If you are in the vicinity of London Bridge Station you must not miss this experience. A fruit, veg and cheese market with unusual selection of products. Taste the offerings, have your lunch and browse around. Looking for something different? you may find it here....smoked eel, live crayfish...just what I wanted||April 18, 2016
lrnnnn||50||A huge, busy & bustling market, filled with artisan & specialist food stalls, selling oils, vinegars, cheese, fruit & veg, bread, cakes, cheesecake, fudge, noodles, burgers, curries etc. Lots of freebies to try as you walk round & an excellent choice for a quick & cheap lunch. As there is so much choice, it's worth walking around the whole market before you decide what to eat.||April 18, 2016
516edwardc||50||What a fantastic place for a bit and or a walk. It's close to the tower and London bridge and is a fantastic place to walk around and explore. Amazing tastes and sights||April 17, 2016
Essex_Girls_11||40||Always full of life, yummy food and drinks to try. Included a visit to the Oyster Bar and Turkish coffee stall. Never get tired of visiting although very busy with tourists now.||April 17, 2016
Clive F||40||This ancient market, just outside the City of London, has transformed itself to remain extremely busy and lively in the modern age; some staples are still sold, but it also caters to higher end tastes, with a number of places to eat and drink.It is near the end of London Bridge, once the only way across the river from the City, by Southwark Cathedral and hemmed in by Victorian railway construction, taking very busy lines right past it on viaducts. Indeed the railway project laughably called Thameslink 2000 has affected the Market in the last couple of years.It is well worth visiting, whether on one's way somewhere else or just for the never ending fascination of people-watching.For all that, I was very surprised to see it graded as London's 15th most popular tourist attraction; if I stood at Heathrow quizzing outgoing passengers I would be very surprised if more than a few had ever heard of it.||April 17, 2016
Keith D||50||Almost next door to Southwalk cathedral, it is what could be best described as a " classy" market. Food is predominantly the main attraction of this market, and not only can you purchase foods, but also eat there. It covers a wide range of foods, as well as good beers. If you have never been there, I would highly recommend you do so.||April 17, 2016
GL129||50||Perfect way to spend a rainy Saturday morning. Had fantastic food and drinks and was amazed by all the high quality local produce - only wished we could have stayed longer. ||April 17, 2016
wolverhampton1972||40||Easy to find this market, it's old fashioned and gives a lovely ambiance to the place. It's mostly about food this market and you can get just about anything. It seems to specialises more in breads and cakes, although their as an abundance of other stalls, it's great to look around at all the different fresh foods on offerThis is a lovely way to spend an hour or two about most.||April 17, 2016
ECrowther||40||Be sure to visit Borough Market Wednesday to Saturday, as most of it is closed on Monday and Tuesday. This is a gourmet food market offering fish, meat, vegetables, fruit, cheeses, olive oils, olives, breads, pastries, etc., as well as many food stalls, all you might expect from an urban central market these days. The market is mostly under cover, except for the walkways in front of some of the food stalls. It is busy, hectic, a bit of a maze that makes it a tiny bit hard to explore, but a feast for the eyes and senses, particularly if you go around tasting where samples of cheese, olive oil, pastries and other items are offered. It is a bit disorderly and dirty compared with the markets we visited in Barcelona and Vienna, and offers less impressive displays, but still makes for a very nice time if you like wandering around viewing and tasting product, and possibly eating at one or more of the food stands. Worth a visit.||April 16, 2016
MartD56||50||Saturday strolling through the market, trying the enormous displays of breads, cheeses and foods of all kinds is a great treat. Its a fabulous place full of life and colour. Finish off with a pint in one of the pubs that surround the market. Well worth a visit.||April 16, 2016
NursebakerToronto||40||After visiting the Old Operating Theatre Museum we found this bustling market, full of wonderful treats. We enjoyed the crowd, the noise and taste testing. We purchased several things to take home as gifts and for ourselves.||April 16, 2016
theresad644||50||OMG the variety of fresh produce is amazing, wish I was in London longer with cooking facility. Cooked food available didn't disappoint in any way other than there were too many options. My friend & I shared our meals as they were huge plus it meant we could try more. Take your time to walk around and taste test the samples on offer. Bon appetite.||April 15, 2016
470janetp||50||Lovely atmosphere, lots to see , interested in the Cider from New Forest as I don't live far from .Nice setting and plenty to see .||April 15, 2016
rookie669||50||After a five day trip to Rome, we made sure we sampled the Borough Market upon our return. What a lovely experience! The variety of foods, the people, the activity of a live, working market all added up to a delightful morning walking around, talking to the vendors and sampling an extensive variety of street food including a British pie, a Scotch egg, a salted beef bagel, a raclette and potato dish, pastries, fruit cups, and on and on. Our sampling took care of breakfast and lunch and pushed us to a late dinner because we were not very hungry as the dinner hour approached. It is a definite must see and experience! ||April 15, 2016
louiseylou||30||We expected it to be bigger with more variety of eating experiences such as more international cuisines. There were different foods available but many were duplicated and not that exciting. We'd walked the whole market in 20 minutes, it reminded me more like what you'd find in a large farm shop. More seating around the market would be helpful so you can enjoy eating the food rather than having to eat while walking and bumping into people all the time.The food we did have was all fresh and tasted very good and we would likely return if we were nearby.||April 15, 2016
Brandon D||50||Can't say enough how awesome and accessible this place is. A little too crowded and crazy for young kids but still doable. The food is out of control and you can taste, try, smell, etc. I promise you you'll get something new every time you go here. Easily the craziest open market this side of Asia. Would totally recommend to anyone. Especially anyone with an adventurous palate. ||April 15, 2016
Chloe T||50||A wonderful place to walk around, a mixture of different products and cuisines. Half market some days for a calmer walk around to speak to the people running the stalls. Thursday-Saturday lunch times are incredibly busy. A wonderful buzz, smell and sight! ||April 15, 2016
siriusleenott||40||Went there with my partner in a sunny Wednesday around lunch time. The place was lovely, and not as crowded as I expected, even thought it being lunchtime and just right around the corner from London Bridge. The small stalls under the high domed roof gave the place a very nice atmosphere, and there was no shortage of choices of what to eat. After trying out two stalls for food, and two stalls for dessert, we left the market with full tummies and in a happy mood.||April 13, 2016
BeakerEdinburgh||40||Lots of choice and deliciously tempting treats that cater for all tastes. Sweet or savoury, and representing a huge choice of cuisines to sample, this is a wonderful place to spend several hours fully exploring. Just make sure you've got a big appetite when you arrive! Some of the stalls are a little same-y, and it's not particularly cheap, but my wife and I still really enjoyed our time spent here.||April 13, 2016
thelondontraveler||50||We were excited to visit London borough as my husband is a chef and enjoys such excursions. We really enjoyed it and tried loads of new things. Strongly suggest a visit||April 13, 2016
MDR241066||40||Enjoyed the first hour but it got far too busy around midday which can't help the stall holders as the buyers can't get through. ||April 13, 2016
395elainem||50||Very cool place to visit and eat. I always take my friends to have lunch or a snack there when visiting London and after our long walk in South Bank promenade along the river.||April 13, 2016
jerseyad||50||Many visits were had to this fine market, and many a tummy full :-)A beautiful heritage setting, bustling with activity and such a wonderful wide variety of food vendors will ensure a bite to everyone's taste. Try the 'Keppacasein' for the best cheese toasty you've ever eaten!||April 13, 2016
KiaKarl||50||Best international food market I've ever visited, but by God - avoid on Saturdays. So many people it wasn't even enjoyable anymore.||April 12, 2016
Itsbegunn||50||I love Borough Market. The food is amazing, the people are great and the atmosphere is so good. It's somewhere everyone must visit when in London. That said, the produce on sale can quite expensive and depending on when you go can be extremely busy. ||April 12, 2016
Mandy B||50||What a brilliant day out....a bit like Camden but better - the food stalls are simply fantastic.....food from around the world. Great stall holders happy to let you try before you buy... cheeses, pastries, cakes, curries, handmade goods....it's all there to be seen.Such a lovely experience whether you're a tourist or even a Londoner. A little busy for young children, buggies but great for older kids that don't mind getting jostled.||April 12, 2016
Rororo97||40||unfortunately we were too full to eat anything at borough market but the food looks very good. saw a frightening sight of a huge hare hung upside down with blood dripping into the plastic bag :S||April 11, 2016
Trek807923||50||This is my favourite place on earth. Even though it was raining while I was visiting, it was the most unforgettable experience from my trip to London. I just LOVED the curry(I believe it was called Malaysian chicken curry?) and the ice cream and cakes and cookies... Everything was beyond PERFECT. I wish I can work nearby so I can visit this market all the time!!||April 11, 2016
Charlie N||50||We stayed at Travelodge at Southwark and ended up here...fantastic suprise....All dirts of artesian food and drink....I wanted to live there! My son had the most amazing burger ever and my daughter coconut pancakes.It's across the road from The Shard and next to Southwark Cathedral....its a must!||April 11, 2016
WDC72||50||If you in London you have to go to borough market, from Wednesday to Saturday is best! Absolute feast for the eyes, delicious food and fabulous quality! Lots to see and eat, fresh, fresh fresh. Beautiful cheeses, meats and veg and much more and absolute feast for the eye and mouth!||April 11, 2016
StelucLive||50||Never tire of a visit here....the market is bustling and vibrant and full of all manner of artisan food stores, fruit and veg purveyors, butchers and fishmongers. You can stock up on ingredients for the weekend or enjoy a delicious street food meal from one of the many fantastic stalls. There is also a large area for small businesses selling high quality confectionary, condiments and such like. Always make a beeline for Borough Market when in London on a Saturday (not open on Sundays). Just across the road from London Bridge tube station.||April 11, 2016
boughsofholly||50||AMAZING! So much good food! I tried so many different things, from pesto and mustard, to turkish delight, paella, eclairs, and pad thai! You could spend all day eating your way through Borough Market. Pie Minister was delicious, and so was everything else I tried!||April 11, 2016
Julie W||40||"Found" this food/drink market at the weekend. A great place for a mooch with a very wide selection of food and drink from not only all over the UK but also all over the world. You could also try before you buy - so you could sample, say, their fresh breads and oils or the hordes of locally produced cheeses. It was a great place to take my 15 year old son - he enjoyed all the tasting opportunities! It was a lovely place to go if you fancy trying some different fayre to that offered by supermarkets. Well worth a visit therefore. Very near London Bridge station so is easy to get to - but if you go try and go early - it was heaving by the time we left after lunch! If you want a chance to browse at your own pace go early! We'll be back to buy some more goods another day!||April 11, 2016
Photography by ... P||50||I run a photography group which attends weekly trips to different places every Friday. Visited here with the group in February (just before Valentine's Day) and loved it - probably one of my favourite places that we've visited! So much variety of food, lots of valentines food ideas which was pretty cool and overall TONS of photo opportunities! Nice to be able to go around and have little tasters of food as well. It was pretty crowded so would hate to visit at a weekend but I would definitely revisit again in the future. Highly recommend visiting to anyone who loves food, or to anyone that loves taking photos :)||April 11, 2016
RhondaJune||40||... or I would have been tempted to buy! Lots of lovely stalls with food, cafe and loo - great to get out of a short downpour. Cheeses, seafood, meat - oh and cider, had a swift half. ||April 11, 2016
Lisa W||40||We went to Borough Market specifically for lunch, the aromas of all the gorgeous food being cook is wonderful!Primarily Borough Market is for tourists, I cant imagine any locals paying the exorbitant prices that are charged for basic fruit and veg.From the amazing selection of street food we chose a Veggie Indian mixed box for £6.00 each, the waxed box was stuffed full of rice and sag and other delicious stuff that I didnt recognise :-)We were stuffed and could barely finish our food so well worth the price if compared to a 'meal' from McDonalds!||April 11, 2016
Ritchie_7||30||Good for people watching. Lots of food carts. Good if you like cheese. Very very very busy on a Saturday. I'm not a foodie person so wasted on me. ||April 10, 2016
L45key||50||Amazing stalls selling an amazing range of foods from around the world. Fantastic fresh produce, will definitely return||April 10, 2016
stonerose5||50||Food stalls of all varieties, inside and out. We went for a Soul Food fish wrap and fish rice box. The fish was great and not too spicy (which we had feared), although the wrap won over the rice, which was bland.We also had an overpriced but fresh fruit smoothie. But thats the fun of it - you might not pick a full-on winner everytime, but its the choice! And just seeing the array of food on offer...a great way to while away an hour or so, as we did (or quickly nip for lunch too, I imagine). There were plenty more places to choose from, I also fancied a pie from Pieminister, scallops, or king prawn wrap (from a shop over the road from the market).There's a few places to sit to eat but there could and should be more, there's enough dead space.||April 10, 2016
Travellerman61||40||Although very crowded on the weekends, we have been here a few times. The hustle bustle may not be everyone's cup of the but if you are up for it, there r Plenty of eating options especially for meat lovers. Several stalls selling cheese, bread, fresh veg and fish.||April 10, 2016
lat28||50||Definitely busy on the weekend when I visited, but a nice mix of takeaway and market foods, locals and tourists. Only wish I'd had a bit more time - but an easy walk to just the other side of the London bridge.||April 9, 2016
indyjls||50||We arrived in London and headed straight to Borough Market. It is such an awesome place. We enjoyed it so much, we returned a second time. Definitely try the fish and chips. They were the best we had in London.||April 9, 2016
mohamedfakhroo||50||It's my favorite market in uk mot only in London , best place in London to find organic and fresh home made food ||April 9, 2016
JE4936||50||This market has a very large amount of food on sale and you can see different foods from all around the world. It is a bit expensive but great for finding something different to eat.||April 9, 2016
Deanna M||50||A great place to spend some time and eat some delicious food. I would recommend having a walk through before buying as there is so much to choose from.||April 9, 2016
Peter B||40||Lively, huge variety of fresh vegetable stalls, venison and meats direct from the farm, Furness fresh fish. If you want a good lunch freshly made burgers and cooked in front of you. Cheeses from France, Italy as well as England and Wales. Good fun!||April 8, 2016
Sandygranny||50||We had a lovely time walking around the market stalls which were selling a multitude of different foods to suit all tastes. We enjoyed sampling some of the freebies being offered to us and there were lots of people trying the different foods. There is something for everyone here at this extensive market and it is a must for all foodies.So if you appreciate good food and like to taste a little bit of everything, then Borough Market is the place for you.We couldn’t help noticing that a lot of people were just there for the freebies but we bought some lovely fresh bread from the baker’s stall to take home and some fruit from one of the other stalls.||April 8, 2016
John F||50||We put this market on our list as a lunch stop and enjoyed walking through the different sections to see all the food offerings. Walk the market before you buy your lunch. There are so many offerings. Yes some of the food is expensive but not all. ||April 8, 2016
Matvl||50||Borough Market is incredible - beautiful displays, a massive array of food from around the world and plenty to taste and buy. Some items rather pricey but lovely to wander through and soak up the ambiance. ||April 8, 2016
Fernz86||50||Unbelievable food and stall set ups. Have just about everything. Ate so much food. Would need to come a couple of times to try other things as well ||April 8, 2016
Tracy M||50||We visited Borough Market as a family of 4, for my children to explore a 'different' part of London to the usual sights. It is full of fabulous food (much of which you can 'try before you buy'), fun stuff and lots of busy life. Around the market area you can also find great restaurants, cafes and bars. You really could spend all day here and see/try so much.My kids loved the atmosphere, the noise, the energy and the food. Well worth visiting and experiencing something different in London!||April 8, 2016
CuriousTraveller81||30||Here to summaries my trip here:- it's better to come early morning since there will be lot of people during lunch time- not a good place to bring stroller or wheel chair. There are lot of people and small space- there are many food stalls and groceries here. - there are many food variety here- not a place to find art shop, souvenir, clothing or other not food related- not many place to seat here. Although there are some restaurant. Be prepare to stand up for eating- the price of the food here is not very cheap for market standard. For example it cost 9 pound to buy a single cake here.||April 8, 2016
P8276GUlisab||50||Eat, drink, explore everything! We ended up at the Market 3 times during our 1 week stay in London for meals, photography and buying cheese to bring home with us (check with Customs before you purchase - hard cheeses were fine, other foods were not).||April 6, 2016
sgk323||50||If you like local farmers markets this is the best one you will visit. It is a very cool area to walk around, has terrific foods to taste. Find the merengue in the back corner. The best merengue we ever had. Would love to have had time to go back a second time.||April 6, 2016
CornwallLily||40||Had fun wandering round this food filled market. The variety of foods available was amazing. Smells delicious and way too tempting. The variety and quality of produce was astounding. A great way to spend a few hours and find a delicious lunch. Toilet facilities are pretty rubbish which is unfortunate if you want to buy street food and eat on the hoof. Pubs and restaurants all round with toilets. ||April 6, 2016
Peter O||40||In nearly the same place since the 13th century the Borough Market is a great place for food and produce.Lots of local producers showcase their wares and is a very popular place for lunch.Anything from a roast pork and crackling roll to a cup of pippies is available as well as traditional English fish and chips and ethnic offerings.Some fantastic fruit and bread on offer as well as items for those with a sweet tooth. I wish I would have had more time to return to this great market.||April 5, 2016
peachesandbear||50||Plenty of great places to try - tasters available. Perfect for a rainy day as covered. Short walk from London Bridge Tube and Rail Station and The Shard.My favourite eats: Venison burgers, dim sum, baked cheesecake and fresh squeezed watermelon juice!||April 5, 2016
Raj_Tee||40||Great market offering a wide range of food for brunch and lunch. Busy with city workers and tourists at lunch time so be prepared for the crowds. The Boston Sausage and Ethiopian food stalls are highly recommended. ||April 5, 2016
azahar_trevor||40||Atmospheric location with lots of interesting stalls (and people) to look at! Lots of opportunity to taste different kinds of snacks, including delicious salt beef sandwiches!Luckily there are some pubs nearby serving great real ale to refresh you. All in all definitely worth a visit to the area.||April 5, 2016
Clivel_98||50||Easy to get to, as it is just beside London Bridge underground and overground stations. An old-style market with a range of different stalls, ranging from ready-to-eat hot food stalls through greengrocer a to specialised artisanal food outlets. A great place to browse - and most stalls allow the tasting of at least some of their goods. Bear in mind that not all stalls are open all the time - I went specifically to find Sweet Roots (a liquorice stall), only to find that it is only open Wednesday to Saturday. Check on the Borough Market interactive map first...||April 5, 2016
Henri8888||40||It is an open-air food market, so do not expect high level of comfort or cleanliness at this place. Nevertheless, the area is chock-full with food stalls with wide range of choice for your taste. It was quite crowded when we went there, so it may take a while before you get what you need, standing in lines. It is a nice experience, to stroll between the stalls and see what is on offer. The food we had was good. In all, I could find only one place with toilets (but then again, did not search the whole area) so you have to wait for a while before you can use them.||April 4, 2016
378karlr||40||Cool place to visit steeped in history. Loads to choose from and could return everyday for 2 weeks and have something different every time!! You will pay for the privilege but it's a cool place. ||April 4, 2016
Gillian5555||50||We were visiting the Tate Modern , who's cafe is under refurb so we took a 10 min walk to this delicious food market . Lunch , snacks, the weekly groceries , treats , what every takes your fancy! Great market displays and opportunity to taste before you buy your lunch. The only downside is that you are pushed if you need to sit down and rest whilst you eat, very limited seating , walls or benches , I didn't fancy sitting on the floor with the children||April 4, 2016
maxmixed||30||Went with very high hopes, expecting great things - Much like food markets used to be when I was a child. But what I found was a place of great trendiness. I saw a single Scotch egg on sale for £4 - Yes I know it may well be a fantastic scotch egg, but four quid...Basically the place was awash with stalls selling all sorts of food at exorbitant prices, I guess this is a sign of the times - How much can we rip off the gullible for. Would I visit again?? No, not for me, I don't like being jostled by groups of Americans or Italians whilst looking at products aimed at the "Trendy" cool kids who hang out here.||April 4, 2016
Jurgen B||50||Living in Brussels I am spoiled for choice but this market wins the competition. Easily. Even in Paris and New York we don't know of a place which such high quality food. You can taste samples everywhere and it's a beautiful building too.||April 4, 2016
kyriacosd||50||I was truly amazed by the amount of stands selling so many varieties of food, and mostly very good food too. From vennisson burgers to pasta and fish to delicious fresh juices and sweets, this market definitely has a lot to offer, see and eat!||April 4, 2016
huge_appetite||50||I often visit here on my trips to London and would buy more high quality groceries here which aren't so easy to find if I lived locally. We arrived at 8:30am on Saturday. Not everything was open yet and we had a little wait for shops to open up for breakfast. I enjoyed a (vegetarian) dosa and my husband a breakfast bap. Shop around for a breakfast bap if that's what you fancy as the fillings and prices vary. You can buy all sorts at the market although there seems to be a lot of bakers compared to other stalls.||April 4, 2016
DevonHelen||50||Fantastic food stalls especially for cheese. Great food to buy when you get the munchies, from oysters to curries, the whole world is here to eat and the atmosphere is great. Good photo ops everywhere.||April 3, 2016
pmcarlo||50||I came across it accidentally and it was a very good surprise. Cheap and delicious food, plus music and parades on Sunday. I went back several times to show it to friends visiting. It surely deserves a look.||April 3, 2016
M0squito||50||Borough Market is a food lover's happy place. :) They must have 1,000 cheeses. The pulled pork sandwich was absolutely delicious. Too bad I didn't have a chance to go there until hours before my flight to Bangkok. I ended up giving half of my cheese to the Uber driver, after finally coming to terms with the fact that I simply couldn't finish it all before customs. :D||April 3, 2016
CraigRGreen||40||A change of plan found us by London Bridge station, so we veered towards borough market at 4pm on a rainy Saturday. The sights and smells are vibrant and the market was packed, as was the surrounding streets containing many bars and restaurants. It's a great historic place to visit, retaining its aged charm. ||April 2, 2016
VivianW411||50||A lively and bustling food market with just about everything you could ever want inside. It's a definite must stop for foodie! Keep in mind, it does get busy since it's a popular attraction for both locals and tourists esp lunch time. But it'll be worth your time.||April 2, 2016
j_marice||50||We visited Borough Market on a chilly morning in February and had a great time taking in the sights and using the excuse of staying warm for extra eating and drinking. Not only is the food all amazing, but it's also absolutely beautiful to look at. The shops displayed thoughtful, appetizing arrays of artisanal meats, produce, pastries, and amazing prepared foods.The Raclette and grilled cheese shop was a favorite, as was the curry. We enjoyed warm coffee, mulled wine, and spiced cider to keep warm. I can only imagine how long we would have stayed to enjoy ourselves on a warm day. It's my understanding that the market has undergone significant expansion and a facelift in recent years, so those who visited in the past may want to give it another try.||April 2, 2016
VyT68||50||A must while in London. Highly recommend truffle fois gras and honey stalls. Delicious original recipes.||April 2, 2016
cmedina||50||I always enjoy checking out local markets when I travel and Borough Market did not disappoint. There were stalls for fresh produce, flowers, artisanal products and lots of amazing-smelling food stalls. The whole area around the market is bustling and lively, lots of cute restaurants to choose from. If you're a foodie, this is a must! ||April 2, 2016
Mike_J_London_153||50||Yes it's expensive, it's way too busy at the wrong times, not all the food is exceptional but its fantastic and one of my fav places in London. A tourist must, avoid Saturdays and thurs-fri 12-2.||April 2, 2016
dirkh864||40||Nice food market with a large variety of food from all around the world. You will also find all kind of products from the country side around London||April 2, 2016
sonjas895||50||A lovely food market, which offers fresh food from all around the world. The market is always quite crowded but it's worth a visit for all food lovers. ||April 2, 2016
Hoghauler||50||Came across this Market by chance and next time we are in London it will be the last place we visit, so we can take home some of the amazing products this place sells. Veg, fresh meat, cured meats, breads and so many types of cheese.Hot food from just about every corner of the world. You must visit.||April 1, 2016
HalleMaisie||30||Mainly street food, sausages, cheeses, Indian food served by a Mexican woman, a hog roast. Not terribly atmospheric||April 1, 2016
Jone K||50||I loved visiting Borough Market, enjoyed food from different cultures and it was highly entertaining to stroll around and discover new exciting flavours. I would recommend visitng the market to everyone who visits London! Go and find your favourite food.||April 1, 2016
John O||40||The Hustle & Bustle of this place on a Saturday Morning is just great fun with such a wide variety of foods & wines there.||April 1, 2016
Arobajase||50||You keep seeing Farmers and Artisan Markets around the country but the organisers need to see this for a blueprint. The quality and quantity of stalls selling everything from meat and fish to fruit and veg with cheese and spices in is amazingThe amount of stalls selling food is amazing. A smaller version of this in permanent City Centre locations would be massive drawsCan't wait to go back||April 1, 2016
shirleyp64||50||I love this place, the hustle, bustle and wonderful smells for the most amazing food. Walk round with a glass of champers or a beer, nibble on the free tasty bits each stall offers to tempt you to their goodies. The range of food is quite incredible and some you simply won't have seen before.....although your market shopping can be quite expensive if you don't watch out! The market is surrounded by wonderful quirky restaurants and bars under the arches, and look out for Bridget Jones Diary apartment front door used in all the films under the railway arches adjoins the pub. Superb experience with some absolutely superb restaurants. Worth the day out!||April 1, 2016
Manb0||50||Went here with my wife for lunch. A beautiful market filled with the finest produce. A whole range of street food to choose from will get your taste buds and senses tingling. Fabulous cakes, cheeses, fruit and veg, fish. A dream for any top chef or house hold cook. Superb||April 1, 2016

The surrounding area is wonderful and it is great just to potter around and sample some of the products. I can quite happily spend several hours here.||April 1, 2016
timocc||50||Okay fellow travelers, this place is out of this world. My girlfriend, who works in the area, took me here on a lunch break and my oh my everything looked and smelled amazing. We chose for a duck confit wrap, only 5 pounds, which was absolutely amazing. They have a bunch of venison burgers, indian food, pastas, and basically every other type of cuisine you could think of. Everything here seemed affordable, and of extremely high quality. Ugh I can't wait to go back.||March 31, 2016
Ayse C||50||Whenever I have friends or family visiting I always make sure I take them to Borough Market. Very centrally located, right next to London Bridge station, full of every type of food imaginable with sangria and prosecco to compliment! What's not to love?||March 31, 2016
cristal86||50||We went on a tuesday morning (not full market). However we really enjoyed the atmosphere. We bought a few things and they were all particular specialties. Really enjoyed. Hope to come back soon to see the full market!||March 31, 2016
lilio74||50||We arrived at 10am. It was still waking, as some stalls were closed, but those that were open were enough to make us stay longer. We had THE BEST pork sandwich ever!!! Along with a venison burger, a chicken hamburger, a Panini, and the best cappuccino we had in London. Holy smokes! Just writing this review makes me want to be back. The market makes for great photos and yummy treats. I recommend you go and taste a bit of everything. Take cash as many vendors don't take credit cards.||March 31, 2016
Svein222||50||The variety, quality and ambiance in this place cannot be beat. Try the duck comfit sandwich, the truffle stuffed tortellini, the oyster, the brownies... EVERYTHING is delicious and cheap! My favorite place in all London! ||March 31, 2016
Jennifer S||50||We had a great visit with a small group of 12with Raj, who was very knowledgable about the history of the market and the food and food prep. We sampled sausages, "proper" fish & chips, fudge, cider, cheeses, donuts, and sticky toffee pudding. My only complaint/suggestion would be to reduce the number of sweets.Raj was terrific.||March 31, 2016
YoshisMum||50||If you are nearby or a couple of stops away by tube this place is well worth a visit. The variety of food, wines and crafts make it a fascinating place. It does become busy so you have to weave the crowds but you feel safe and if you visit early enough it won't be much of a problem. We bought some delicious Cornish cheese and spices as we were conscious about not carrying too much weight. Lots of food samples were available and no pushy sales folk made this an enjoyable experience. If there was one negative thing to mention it would be the lack of seating and eating facilities to enjoy the great street food.||March 30, 2016
Wilson T||50||If you like to try local and diverse food this is the place. It is a big market with many different stands that serve local and foreign food. There is a great variety from deer meat burgers, to paellas or fresh oysters. As you walk around and see all the different options, you can buy fresh and gourmet food or get hot meals to eat there.It is normally full of people so it is hard to find a place to seat to eat. It normally serves breakfast and lunch options, but they close around 5-6pm, so make sure to go early as they do not serve dinner.||March 30, 2016
kevinh6016||50||Great place to see all kinds of food. We had lunch at a stall with pulled pork and mac n cheese hero. Great atmosphere and smells! Was not busy when we ere there but understand it can get crazy.||March 30, 2016
hoggybell||50||What an insane amount is of good quality food! Perfect for a snack or meal before going up the shard! ||March 30, 2016
Tartufo17||50||Simply outstanding. What a place. So much to choose between. Really charming place. So much to taste, eat or buy. The food and juices we tasted were just wonderful. Excellent quality. We will return for sure. ||March 30, 2016
EveningEater||50||Such atmosphere. Full of life, and as for the foods and drinks on offer, everything looked fresh and tempting. So much to try and enjoy. Little seating though, only some in a characterless glass area of the market, or restaurants near the market. We enjoyed lunch at Bedales, super good and wines and a nice place to sit. This is the first time we have visited the market but I don't think it will be the last! ||March 30, 2016
EmmaN326||50||I have been to Borough Market many times and always enjoy going back.There is a great range of produce to buy and take home or food to eat whilst you are there. It is also surrounded by some good bars and restaurants as well.Saturday is always the busiest day of the week, it's hard to move around, but the bustle adds to the atmosphere. The sellers are always a pleasure to deal with.The market is open every day, except Sunday. If you really felt like a foodie day you could always start in Bermondsey and choose a late breakfast from Druid Street Market and/or Ropewalk. Then wander down to London Bridge, maybe stopping at a pub on 2 on the way, and end at Borough market for your lunch... or the other way round.Sounds like a perfect day to me :)||March 30, 2016
jenk373||50||Not to be missed. It's a market of food stalls that never ends. Pasta - yes with truffle and venison and boar meat. Paella - oh yes they have seafood paella cooked in s huge pan with aromas that will have you salivating. Cheeses and hams, jams, chutney, truffle oils, herbal teas, wild meats burger, fish market, scallops cooked in front of you, cider hot and cold - you get the idea! You walk and you eat and you walk and eat more! Not to be missed if you are in London. ||March 30, 2016
sandynel||50||If you're a foodie with a few hours to spare whilst in London, this is the place to be. A lot more stalls than I thought there would be with a wide range of tasty morsels.||March 30, 2016
aiklam||50||This place reminds me of the weekend markets in the States, except Borough Market opens on the weekdays too. From the local British produce (check out the fresh fruit, vegetable, mild wine, sausages) to sampling across an international range of cuisine from Egypt, Spain, Thailand, among the few I tried, there is something at every stall that made me stop and go "wow, check it out"; my favorite would be the freshly shucked oysters; simply delicious! This is a definitely great place to visit on an empty stomach. ||March 30, 2016
MissBobbles01||50||My first visit to Borough Market - my one regret - why have I not been here before? Make sure you are hungry - its a feast for the eyes and the soul. Artisan breads and cakes, kangaroo, crocodile and camel burgers - all freshly made (although I didn't try one). Freshly squeezed juices which were delicious. If you love cheese then you have arrived in cheese heaven - every cheese you could every imagine built in mountains (well almost). Fantastic homemade sauces and oils - have you tried wasabi mustard? Lovely spice stalls too. If you love food then don't miss this market. ||March 30, 2016
Claudia H||40||we visited on the day before Easter and the crowds were overwhelming. I would have stayed longer to check it all out, but my group didn't enjoy all of the people. So...if you go, be prepared and be ready for crowds and noise. That said, there was so much to see and really good street food and crafts/art to be seen.||March 29, 2016
Thenewexplorer||50||Soooo worth a visit if you're into food! Lots of local food from people with all different nationalities and all fresh/ just made! Cheese, paella, Scottish eggs, veggies, bread, juices, baklava, it's all there!||March 29, 2016
rensos||40||This permanent market has some great craft foods and beverages. You can buy everything you need for a picnic or your snack platter for friends coming over. Some good butchers as well ||March 29, 2016
EduardoO841||50||We have been many times in London but had never come to this interesting side of the city. It is lively, full of young people and tourists. The market is a little messy but with a wide variety of food from different parts of the world. We tried an incredible corned beef sandwich (or similar) which was tasty and very nice. Also bought cheeses from England and some Italian that were extremely good as well as superb organic bread. Not many places to seat, not as organized as markets serving food in Spain of New York but still a great experience||March 29, 2016
Around_The_World_A||50||We found this market by accident some years ago and came back many times only to find out that it was the famous borough market. :-) always a trip worth for all kinds of foods or just for a drink.||March 29, 2016
Ben F||50||A nice place to go to grab some Street food, from Egyptian to Ethiopian to German hot dogs. All very nice and hard too choose. Something nice for everyone. ||March 29, 2016
Andrei S||50||This is a great place wonder for food lovers. The variety of cuisiones from around the world means you are bound to find something interesting every time. Many vendors offer small samples of their goods for you to try untill you find just what you were looking for.Advice, bring cash. There are ATMs at nearby banks, but during weekends there could be queues. Also, from my experience it has been better to go closer to closing time since it can get very packed during peak lunch times.||March 29, 2016
stephenmV6779NX||40||Great food on offer. We chose the pulled pork sandwich from one of the stalls and washed it down with a glass of prosecco that was on offer. Very busy market but well worth the experience.||March 28, 2016
R5871BQmarks||40||This place is south of the Thames and is convenient if you are going to the Globe Theatre, the Clink Museum, the London Eye and anything just south of the Thames. Open food market (primarily) with countless food vendors and great smells. There are some other brick-and-mortar restaurants and pubs there as well. The only thing I didn't notice were any places to sit down and enjoy your meal unless you went to a proper restaurant. But this is a fun place to witness at lunch time in London. ||March 28, 2016
Tanjia H||50||This was everyones favorite place in London. I can't say enough about this market. The food was amazing. It gets very busy. We went early then went to a museum but we had to go back and get more treats for the market so we went twice in one day.||March 28, 2016
Sjburnouf||50||What an amazing market didn't know what to expect I thought it was a general market, I mean clothes ,food bric brac and the rest . But wow was I suprised the stalls that offer you every food available from cheeses ,wines ,fruit,veg and copious amounts of butchers bakers and every conceivable food . Plus if you want you sample them all ,it's a must visit ||March 28, 2016
shannia2014||50||Came here with a friend during a conference break and enjoyed strolling the stalls -especially tasting the great food on site! Planning on coming again in June!||March 28, 2016
YorksUKYorksUK||50||This is a really lovely market. Lots of really nice stalls and lots of free samples.Went on Saturday and it was packed. Really good atmosphere. ||March 27, 2016
Kcoyne2013||50||Love this place, great to visit at weekend. The buzz in the streets, people just coming together to relax, enjoy the atmosphere and try the different foods and drink . A fantastic array of food from all cultures , the smells are heavenly , not enough markets like this around in our towns and cities now , a great alternative to some of the other attractions London has to offer and a great way to spend a couple of hours. ||March 27, 2016
LSinNJ||20||I love outdoor food markets and have been to several throughout the world. But this one was so jammed, and where the lines began was so hard to discern, that the experience frustrated rather than appealed. Everything we tried we enjoyed immensely, and I suppose if it were a bit less crowded and I didn't fret about unintentionally cutting a line, it would have been better.||March 27, 2016
samlidyard||50||It's amazing you can go around all the stalls they have loads of food to try.you can try so many variations of cheeses meats breads all sorts.you get a feel of the hussle and bussle.||March 27, 2016
HowieZ_13||40||A very fun place to walk around and grab something to eat.. Not fancy but amazing... I would suggest you sample some of the different foods.||March 27, 2016
julieaB5539YT||40||Food of every type here, very busy at the weekends. Make sure you don't eat before you go, we especially like Wokit, their noodle and rice dishes are incredibly filling. ||March 27, 2016
149princessak||50||Honestly I went to fancy eateries while in London but this place was my fave!!Clean, organised, friendly vendors, free samples, reasonable prices, so much variety- Oysters (my loves), smoked meats, cheeses, carving stations, fish & chips, wines, desserts... You name it and I'm sure it's there! I can't wait to go back!||March 26, 2016
Mikael P||50||There are quite a few good markets in London with a wide range of goods and street food. Borough Market is mostly about food in all forms and shapes. It isn't as large as I might have thought. It seemed to have only a few stands of each type, like fish, vegetables, cheese, bread and so on but the quality of it all was impressive even though I obviously didn't try or taste everything. You really should check out this place for yourself. I'm sure you will find many interesting foods to buy and/or try. Note to self though: English mustard is too strong and takes over even the most delicious salted beef so if offered - stay away :)||March 26, 2016
markw31134L154||40||We went to Borough market Easter Saturday Was great to see and lovely to experience the foods was fab And a good time generally had,Do beware though, although the food was lovely and nice to tryA little e pensive if going their on a buget Not enough time we felt to fill a day so use as a partDay with something else No tables and chairs to sit down for a while or eat atProp on a wall or stand , so not the best ||March 26, 2016
J9386WBjohnm||40||The borough markets are a must see, my girlfriend and I bought a giant chocolate chip cookie and it tasted great. There was like heaps of flies around though ( I just pretended I didn't see them land on any of the food) The food is quite good here a bit $$ so yeh. Check out the Malty Markets too if you enjoyed this spot. ||March 26, 2016
DeavBBQ||50||A must go for all foodies. Outstanding market with something for everyone. Great restaurants, pubs and wine bars all the time. But the weekends are a must with the vendors set up throughout the market. Great food and drink of all types. Go hungry and plan to stay for awhile. Very crowded, just plan for it and enjoy.||March 26, 2016
DeBees||50||Love wandering around the Borough Market, especially wandering from stall to stall at breakfast time. Perfect start to a day exploring this wonderful City.||March 26, 2016
60404Cja||50||Busy but a great vibe ! Tried a chicken pot pie and an amazing custard donut !!! The food choices are very diverse and it was fun to simply walk around and watch all the food vendors make their delicious dishes !!! Fun ! ||March 25, 2016
perthwinegirl||50||It was very busy today but worth the visit, lots of stalls with food and drinks. Beautiful food, feels like you are in a personalized degustation day. I absolutely loved the Chicken Sharwarma wrap, so glad we stopped at this point. Oooh and all the fresh fruits are just incredibles. If you are in London, this is a must visit place - put it in your bucketlist! . We will be heading there tomorrow again :-)I will suggest to bring cash to pay. ||March 25, 2016
djw1955||50||Borough market was not fully opened on the Tuesday when I visited, but what a joy to look around, sample some food, especially the cheeses. Very friendly stall holders and well worth a visit even if its raining.||March 25, 2016
Viviana1978||50||You will find everything in here. Fresh juice, bakery, wine, beers... And a lot of people. I loved it... There is an explosion of smells and it's very well done.||March 24, 2016
gillank||40||Its so busy you can hardly choose which direction to walk in and it's overpriced, but it's still Londons premier destination for foodies. People in the know might be choose spa terminus area to go instead. But a visit to Borough when in London is a must. ||March 24, 2016
Sally W||50||As a London foodie I have been visiting Borough Market for many years to buy treats such Mrs Kings Pork Pies, anchovy olives from Brindisa and coffee beans from Monmouth. It's generally a flying visit as the market can get really busy. For tourists this place is a must see destination not just to buy food and drink but to also enjoy so many different types of food to eat there and then. While you're there it's also worth visiting Southwark Cathedral for a little bit of peaceful contemplation.||March 24, 2016
Brackendaisy||50||if you love sampling food this is the place for you. There are lots of stalls selling lovely foods. many of them are different some organic some without sugar, there are fresh juices, olives, breads, cakes, cheese, granolas to name a few. Lots of hot foods to eat too. Delicious!! But only take cash as many stall holders don't take cards at all and you wont want to miss out on all the treats available.||March 24, 2016
Marie M||50||Amazing market to wander through, seeing lots of different food stalls and the smells are incredible! A food lover's dream!||March 24, 2016
rachilde||50||Wow! People had prepared me for the Borough Market, but it was still overwhelming. There was a seemingly never-ending cavalcade of food that was as much a feast for the eyes as for the mouth. Imagine being able to sample whelks and other UK shellfish, then move onto duck confit sandwiches, excellent coffee, Thai street food, UK cheeses, fresh oysters, and pastries. That doesn't even begin to cover the variety. Easy to get to. Don't bother with breakfast, just go here. It gets crazy for lunch, so factor that in mind.||March 23, 2016
lelfoot||40||Met a friend here a couple of Saturdays ago. A vibrant, busy place with lots of food and drink. I found a little cider bar while I waited for my friend. Very good. Will be back.||March 23, 2016
Stefan H||50||Whether you seek top quality provisions from around the globe for kudos dinner parties, or chow down on the most delicious street food to fortify your Thames riverbank meanderings, this is an essential stop over for any and all foodies, ale lovers, winos and coffee connoisseurs.Music may well be the food of love. This food is music to your taste buds...||March 23, 2016
Anthony T||40||If you are in London you should visit this Market where you will find fruit and vegetables from all over the World, it is within a short walk of London Bridge Station.You can eat in or out from the scores of restaurants from all kinds of food you can think of, too numerous to mention at very reasonable prices.||March 23, 2016
colinobx||40||great time, wandering about B Market for lunch, roast meats in baps, noodles in pots with choices, cake shops, etc. Bought good beer and loved the location.||March 22, 2016
KerstiKlami||50||Borough Market is a place I always recommend to visitors, as it is an amazing opportunity to savour the range of wonderful cuisines that the city has to offer. Thanks to its renovation a couple of years ago, it is also a great choice on a rainy day. There are lots of stalls where you can grab a lovely lunch at a reasonable price, and stalls with exotic cheeses, meats, fish, mezze, cakes, chocolates, breads etc. to take home with you. There are also a few nice pubs around the market. The whole area tends to get very busy at weekends though, so the best time to visit is on Saturday just as the place the opens in the morning. After, at lunchtime you will struggle to walk around and see all that's on offer.||March 22, 2016
224stephanr||50||So really had no idea, figured just a market, but amazing food, great people - phenomenal smells from every corner. Pricing was standard nothing crazy but the food was delicious and the selection as well. Must see, must do, must eat a lot!! ||March 22, 2016
I8287POanthonyc||40||Me and a group of friends went to watch a few teams dance around the area. Great atmosphere and food. The small ale pubs are pricey but very good. ( not the Meantime ones) ||March 21, 2016
efchutchy||50||What a great place this is. So much food and drink choice. Glad we read the reviews on here before and decided to visit. Would happily visit again, you can get anything from hot roast to Ethiopian cuisine to salt beef sandwiches. I wish there was more places like this in the North of England. ||March 21, 2016
Mike P||50||I was treated to a meal at Roast above the market, but we wandered around first. So much high quality food on offer with plenty available to sample. The place was buzzing with life and noise. Took home breads, cheeses and meats. A must visit.||March 21, 2016
Rayzor57||50||To pass some time, we checked into the Borough Market for a few hours. It brought back memories of the Queen Vic market in Melbourne with the diversity of smells and sights. I chose the Paella as a lunch. Just loved it and the coffee from Monmouth.||March 21, 2016
Eleanor D||50||This beautiful and historic market is one of my favorite things in London. Brimming with international cuisine it is such a fun place to spend the morning. Open Wednesday through Saturday, go early, grab a glass of champagne and wander. Afterwards go to The Market Porter Pub or Wheatshief for a beer and to people watch. Follow that by a stroll down the south bank or a walk across Millenium bridge to St Paul's. This market is rated #5 in the world!||March 21, 2016
Andrew S||50||Loved Borough Market. The food was phenomenal and despite how busy it was, lines moved quickly. Easily the best food market I've been to. ||March 21, 2016
Nichakarn F||50||The market is just beside London bridge tube station. It's so easy to spot. All of the food and fruits are delicious!! ALL OF THEM. Just go!! I would highly recommended anyone to visit here at least once!!||March 20, 2016
SheyS05||40||By the time I had finished my research for our trip to London, I had heard so many great reviews about Borough Market, that we had to visit this place. We are glad we did! It was pretty much a food fair with a variety of food and drink stands. We tried food/drinks from many stands as we could, and were extremely full by the end of it. I wanted to go back before we left, but didn't have time :( The only reason I gave 4 stars was because it was a little crowded. Don't let the crowds be the reason you don't visit this place. If you keep walking further up the mall, you can get a view of the London Bridge as well. The Globe is also very close this market, which we ended up visiting right after. Overall it was a delicious experience :)||March 20, 2016
MartinaL_GM||50||Amazing place, full of pleasant smells, different food, great fish&chips, fish soup, best coffee bar nearby. Can get very busy during lunch time and weekends||March 20, 2016
loveholidays1010||40||Went on a Saturday during lunch time. It was very busy and I was glad not to have brought my kids along! The choice of food at the market was fantastic, everything ranging from cooked to fresh with much choice. Some of the vegetables were rather exotic!! Never seen deep purple peppers and round aubergine which looked like purple cabbage. All in all we spent several hours in there trying various food and just wondering from stall to stall taking in the wonderful array of food. I'd highly recommend the market to any food lover!! ||March 20, 2016
FionaMKent||40||Love this place.. Took my Sister & Brother-in-law who were visiting from the North, they loved it and we ate our way around for lunch all finding something we liked. The food and displays are awesome as always. And the toilets at the market are very clean.||March 20, 2016
Pam154||50||Had a lot of fun with my family of 5, trying new foods and eating A TON!! Worth going to! We were in London for 4 days, and are very glad we went!!||March 20, 2016
citymomNewYork||50||My favorite place in London. Wonderful cheese, sausages, italian specialities, granola and so much more. Very crowded around lunch time as office workers eat lunch from the myriad food stalls but no where to sit. Amazing coffee from Monmouth coffee worth standing in line for and cheese from Neals Yard is a must!||March 20, 2016
Sean A||50||What a great place for a day out, fantastic vibe and loads of artisan food and drinks stall, particularly enjoyed The Globe pub and its fab restaurant. Will definitly have to get to town again for a revisit||March 20, 2016
crazistevo||40||Loved almost everything about the place, the food was pricey but worth it. Kangaroo Burgers, Pad Thai, hundreds of hidden gems. Just way too crowded to fully appreciate the entire market..||March 19, 2016
Gary T||50||An incredibly fun market just over the London Bridge that is crammed with shops selling locally grown and produced foods. Lot's of organic vegetables and fruits, hormone and antibiotic free meats, locally produced cheese, sausage, ETC.Also lots of shops selling lunch- Fish and Chips, Meat Pie's (Pieminister is a rave), pulled pork sandwiches, ETC.Also Wild Beef has some delicious minute steaks if you have a room that allows you to prepare your own breakfast or lunch.It is a busy crowded place so go early. Check the schedule though, they open at 10 some days and close early on others plus it is closed on Sunday.||March 19, 2016
shaz3004||50||Went here with family and friends and it was amazing. Food from all over the world and tasters for everyone. Great place and will definitely go back.||March 19, 2016
wearyLondon||40||Again, plenty of tourists both local and foreign, twenty minutes and you have a good idea of what's on offer.Pricing is sort of ok. Not sure what street food is anymore, I was under the impression that it was by the poor for the poor.Plenty of bread and cheese merchants not forgetting the choice of burgers of all sorts and not forgetting the pulled this and that, sausage rolls for two squid fifty and four squid for a pie, OMG. Tried the sort of Chinese noodle thingy with a sort of dried out shreds of chicken for six squids. Not bad, the two chilli sauces is great, killer hot. Give the 4 dumpling for three squids a miss. Foolishly I decided to try a backlava, this was a big hunk, well you would think so for six squid and forty. Blimy, needed to walk that off, so I decided to take a stroll to the Tate Modern.Overall, okay, give it a try, convinienty located by London Bridge Tube station, ||March 19, 2016
SharingIsCaring2013||40||I love most markets, especially the lively ones like this one or in Barcelona and so on. This is a fun place, gets very busy at times but it is still a great place walking around and enjoying the foods and drinks on offer. It has history and a lot of funky stuff. I wonder how locals put up with all the tourists. Give yourself some time there to enjoy and do not take the kids unless you have too.||March 19, 2016
DTS716||40||This place is packed with all kinds of food and drinks. You'll have difficulty choosing a wide selection of food. I ate the best Burger with sausage and bacon. This market has limited place to seat, but thats ok, so you can move around and explore more bread and pastries, fruits, meat and seafood products, wine and beer, and the coffee, and a lot more. A market where foodies will definitely have a great time. We will always visit Borough market.||March 18, 2016
Ashley E||50||The most amazing food I have ever sampled. We had the pork rolls, and the were divine. It wasn't too busy at 10am when we visited, it's mostly undercover in the event of rain.||March 18, 2016
karanstaples||40||not all of borough market was open on the day we went but what was open was lovely. lots of different types of food stalls selling everything you could want. we will go back again.||March 18, 2016
TravellerfromSIN||50||This is a market that I will always visit when in London as it's so vibrant and has really good food. A shame that we were there on Tuesday and Wednesday this time when the market is not fully open but nevertheless, still very enjoyable. Great choice of cheeses, teas, balsamic vinegar, truffle oils. And the yummiest of donuts. ||March 18, 2016
jnlv2trvl||50||Easy to wander around, taste and sample the delights of what is on sale, from market stall to street food. This bustling food market caters to everyone - Cake, burgers, butchers, veg stores, juice bars, cheese stands, pies, etc. I enjoy the Scottish eggs.||March 18, 2016
alerda||40||Borough market is very nice,clean and well organized. the vegetables and fruits displays are colourful and inviting. the fish varities are unbelievable. meats and poultry all fresh and clean. beautiful flower shops, cheese shops everything you expect on a market place ,you can find at Borough Market.. also available are lots of street food stalls with really tempting original delicacies. shld you prefer a nice cup of cofee or a beer at the pub or gourmet fish restaurant-it is all there within easy walking distance. and the prices are well below the British supermarket prices. a real pleasure trip worth yr while.||March 18, 2016
brendzkt||50||The amazing thing about BM is that you get to spend a hour or two experiencing all sort of different flavours and tastes...I personally just went for the Paella stand because I do love a good paella which did Not disappoint me btw...had a really lovely time walking around and looking forward to my next foodie experience there to taste something a bit different. There are flavours for everybody and you should deffo find something that tickles your taste buds.||March 18, 2016
EJMeath2015||50||We ventured here around lunchtime and it was buzzing. As well as shopping for your meat, veg, pasta, etc. you can also have your lunch al fresco or take away. There are stalls specialising in cheeses, breads, pork and other meats, fish, juices - you name it and they have it. Quality and passion are all around you. There are some non-food stalls, e.g.flowers, ceramics. Thankfully there are toilet facilities but be warned - the queue for the ladies is the usual length!||March 17, 2016

The food stalls were really fantastic, everything looked fresh and was good value for money. It's not a huge market so doesn't take long to get around, but definately worth a visit.||March 17, 2016
jamieson483||40||Not as big as I thought but still a heaven for foodies, fresh veg, fruit, cheese, meat and anything else you can think of, good outside area with plenty of street food stalls but these aren't a patch on those found at Camden lock market, even so well worth the visit||March 17, 2016
909mayq||50||We love this small market which is full of flavours, colours and cultures. You can find nice fresh seafoods, exotic fruits and nice Coffee. However there's an absolutely awful sushi place! Rest I would highly recommend! ||March 16, 2016
beckymanson93||40||Absolutely love borough market. Can't wait for summer - perfect place to come for bits for lunch. Cheese, meats, all fresh and available to try before you buy. Sellers all have character and unique. Definitely recommendLooks like some works are being completed at the moment to make it even better. ||March 16, 2016
AGuyFromHawaii||50||Borough Market is a great place to hang out, eat, buy food for later, and just plain old people watch. We went there in late October on a weekend day that just so happened to be Apple Day, a day where they were celebrating local varieties of apples. There were exhibitions, entertainers in period costumes, and just a lot of things going on.If you like seafood, there were at least a few stalls that had local oysters on sale to eat there or takeaway. I had a few and they were quite good. All in all, I would definitely head back to Borough Market the next time I'm in London. If you want to avoid the crowds, I strongly suggest you get there early before the tourist buses start dropping people off.||March 16, 2016
TACOB0B||40||We visited on a Monday in mid March. Our purpose was to pick up some spices as there is a good little spice shop in the market, and thank God they were open. About 50% of the market was closed but there were several food stall behind the market that were open. This is a great market if you can visit on a weekend. Lots of cook to eat food as well as fresh vegetables, meats, and cheeses. There are also several crafters set up at the market. We recommend having lunch here. Highly recommend.||March 16, 2016
Graham B||50||Though I was brought up in Brixton South West London I had never been to Borough Market before. I was really impressed by all the different foods from around the world, the smells were amazing. I just wish that I had done this before.||March 15, 2016
mazoo777||50||Walking around Borough market is something I would highly recommend, the stalls offer worldwide cuisine..... street food at its very best!Once your are full and meander out of the market, why not visit Southwark Catherdral, The Shard , Shakespeare's Globe or the Tate Modern, all just a 5 min stroll from the market. I actually just love walking along the Southbank promenade next to the River Thames, whatever the season you really feel that you are in old London town.If you would like to be based there then I would highly recommend staying at Premier Inn Southwark, London. I've stayed there many times and everything I have mentioned here and much more is within a 5 - 10 min walk. Very clean and comfy and breakfast is served in a pub connected to the hotel which overlooks the river Thames, literally a few meters away and is said to be the oldest pub in London! Hope this helps...have fun. ps there is a great Nandos restaurant built into the arches under the bridge just outside the premier Inn hotel. Have fun and enjoy!||March 15, 2016
Sandra B||50||Definitely a must in London. Larger, much more chillaxed and diverse than Naschmarkt in Wien, but of the same welcoming atmosphere. It was full of smells and conversations even today, practically one otherwise dull and gray winter day. The venison burger, fresh oysters from the stall, cheeses, wines and ales, Turkish delights, organic Columbian coffee and whatnot. I was also surprised that market continued on the nightlife wibe after the stalls were gone, and there were as many people. I am definitely going back tomorrow.||March 15, 2016
vickilovesluxury||50||Parked at Canary Wharf got in the klipper river boat got off at London Bridge and walked to Borough Market its so vibrant and buzzy lots of food stalls I would recommend it for a lovely day out .||March 15, 2016
275clarel||30||Lovely place to wander and try out the various foods on offer but beware it's a bit of a tourist trap. Expect to pay top prices. Worth a visit though.||March 15, 2016
BDR416||40||Excellent place to grab a lunchtime snack. The artisan food stalls were great places to browse but with London prices. Lots of attractions nearby so good for half day visit||March 15, 2016
sarahgS4538UM||50||Fabulous place to experience so many food vendors, delicous Duck Rolls! Coffee! Stalls and stalls of produce - a photographers delight! Great Spanish grocery, and of the cheese rooms ! Take your marketing basket and go on an empty stomach and a full camera battery ! Had a teenager with us that was not that interested otherwise would have stayed longer after he was full ! ha ha||March 15, 2016
kailij||50||We loved borough market. We came here on our way to the south shore and fell in love! My husband and I love food and there is so much selection here, and the food is delicious. The quality of the food is also excellent! We also liked the atmosphere. The market is located under some above ground train rails. But it doesn't feel like you would expect. Because you are surrounded by great food and cute little vendors, the location adds to the atmosphere. If you are coming to London, come here at the beginning of your trip so you have some good food for meals or snacks while touring around. But the full market is open only Wednesday to Saturday. Lunch market is Monday- Tuesday. ||March 15, 2016
Neeners815||50||Everything I had here was absolutely delicious. In particular the stand with the fish wraps towards the front, and the small stand in the baked food area in the back.||March 15, 2016
DanaiF||50||I just wish I lived closer to visit every week or even every day.It is a typical must see market and the products are great. I highly recommend the visit.||March 15, 2016
Flashmen||50||We had the pasta from La Tua Pasta small shop, ordering the crab pasta and wild boar pasta.. Very very good.I also found a lovely little shop selling salted beef rolls with hot mustard, gerkins and melted cheese on ryebread... Best meal of the day.Might go back today||March 15, 2016
imKatieK||40||a great variety of farm fresh produce and many restaurants. plan to spend a couple of hours to get the feel for this place. ||March 14, 2016
cleo01Bournemouth||40||Was taken to the market as I had never been there, what a great place from the wonderful architecture to the delicious cooking smells. I really recommend eating at any of the stalls, there is a good variety to choose from, the largest roll I saw had pulled pork with an enormous mound of Mac and cheese on it. Literally heart stopping but delicious I'm sure. We bought some great Swiss cheese from the market that I've never had before, very easy to spend lots of money there on good food products. Would recommend as a place to visit.||March 14, 2016
HaDa2000||40||Its a market where you can get seafood, produce, fresh squeeze juices, sandwich etc. Rather interesting, but not too impressive. It was on our way to walk to Shakespeare Globe threater.||March 14, 2016
PaulMfromPoole||50||What a great place! Whether you are a foodie or not, the sights, sounds, colours, smells and flavours from this place will blow you away. Walking round everyone it taking everything in, everyone seemed to be happy to be there. Just the array of foods and drink, catering for everyone with a complete ethnic diversity too. Although busy it was chilled and relaxed. Just a great place to go to while away an hour or 2.||March 14, 2016
touchdownjj||50||It was a mistake to get there by 1 pm. The place was so crowded, and no one can move. The lines were so long infront of all the food stalls. But, if you have the patience, and is not afraid of the crowd, this place offers many international food choices, if you are able to find a place to sit down and eat, this would be a lovely place to spend an afternoon. ||March 14, 2016
vickieb2011||50||Great atmosphere great food and drink a must but don't eat before you go try the market stalls people just walking round trying different foods brilliant! Pub had a great atmosphere as rugby was on. Really enjoyed the experience!||March 13, 2016
Mobelob||50||Had a great time here with some friends. White Christmas. The range of food was amazing. We all ended up getting different meals from different stalls. All were delicious. Then enjoyed a few glasses of prosseco as we wandered around enjoying the stalls. A great interesting day out. ||March 13, 2016
Yorkshire_Bunny||40||Get here early and with an empty stomach. There's fish, meat, fruit, veg and flowers along with cooked dishes such as hot sandwiches, paella, soup and baked goods.The building is old and attractive and what food I tried was nice but it is very touristy.||March 13, 2016
Diane N||50||Whilst staying nearby, I visited Borough Market several times. I breakfasted nearby and then enjoyed walking round the market. It was good to see the Boston sausages on Mountains stall. I particularly enjoyed all th flavours of the Sru Lankab teas that were being offered as tasters. The jam and pickles from Yorksire were excellent. Needless to say several purchases were made!||March 13, 2016
Angela H||50||Borough Market is one of my favourite places in the UK! Its not like a usual market, but think of it as a massive farmers market with all sorts of specialities. There are lots of options for sampling the foods on offer, and there are so many things to buy. There is a great atmosphere there, particularly on a Saturday, although it does get very busy. There are a number of coffee shops and pubs around the area too, but with so much choice of food on the market, you can easily busy your lunch from the stallholders, the one that sells paella and curry in the middle of the covered area is one of our favourites. Its easy to find from London Bridge tube station, and is a lovely way to spend a couple of hours. I always mean to take a cool bag with me so I can take some of the cheeses and meats home with me, but always forget. Next time!!||March 13, 2016
Pigsee||50||Over from Melbourne and took my Mum on a busy Saturday. So much fresh, amazing and diverse food, cheese, meats, cakes, eateries, I could go on.So many fresh little eateries, very hard to decide which one to have lunch at. If you love food, this place is a must.Also grab a pie from Pieminister to take home for later.||March 12, 2016
travel-lms||50||We've visited markets on many of our travels, and the Borough Market really stands out. The fresh food is very well presented, and there are lots of prepared plates to try too. The paella looked great. We ended up buying a picnic lunch to eat by the Tate because everything was so tasty. The cheese and sausage vendors let us try everything, and helped us select the best picnic fare.||March 12, 2016
RobDowling||50||I was seriously overwhelmed by this experience. The buzz and vibrance of this market is unique. Thoroughly enjoyed walking around the various stalls The Produce was presented beautifully and the food up for grabs was simply divine. I dare anyone to walk through this market and not cave to a couple of treats. every few steps I just got more tempted. ||March 12, 2016
DyanL15||50||Very nice place to leisurely walk around. Very friendly people. The food here is awesome and fresh. A definite must when in London. Make sure you visit around lunchtime.||March 12, 2016
PhoebeNJ||40||I recognised this place from Bridget Jones Diary, where she bought the food to make blue soup and orange gunk.It was quite an amazing experience wandering amongst the numerous stalls with an amazing array of products and foods. Well worth exploring, and to take something back home.||March 11, 2016
roma01||50||I think we arrived here at a perfect time on a Saturday morning, around 10.30. There was a great atmosphere but still quiet enough to have a leisurely browse around. We had a salted beef sandwich with everything on it (of course!), delicious.In the afternoon we came back to buy a late lunch but it was so ridiculously busy, the amount of people waiting in line at most stalls were extremely long. We were so glad that we had also been there in the morning. Thank goodness the food stall with Roast Classic was pretty quiet and I had a fantastic Pork Belly, crackling and applesauce sandwich, so good!Just loved all the stalls here, such a variety.||March 11, 2016
Janet J||50||Loved this place! Great for a lunch stop or to walk around. All the food was so fresh! Highly recommended if you visit London||March 10, 2016
Kesolaisa||50||I was really giddy once I saw the market! Especially the section with all the kiosks and stalls selling different mouth-watering food and cuisine!!! This place is very suitable for hungry tourists who've just strolled along the river Thames, for couples going out on a date, friends catching up over some delicious food, or even families having their weekend get-together. It is a really nice place to buy different stuff for variable prices. I would definitely return to buy some stuff and sample the other food stalls. This is a must-visit place!!||March 10, 2016
Kitty544||50||Food market in a nice area in London. Nice walk by the river, and stop at this market for snack, lunch or buy products for home cooking.||March 10, 2016
Jetsetter38||50||This place is great. Loads of stalls all reasonably priced. I could have eaten about 20 things but I had some wonderful paella which the gentleman was handing samples out for before I ordered. I also had some cheesecake which came with a fork so I could eat it there and then. The bakery stall was really good as was the hog roast stall. This is a fab place to hang around for a while to people watch and absorb the atmosphere. There was a man with a guitar singing and it was a lovely place to visit, especially to escape the hustle and bustle of London without going to far. It is also right by the Shard so combine some sightseeing too.||March 9, 2016
levi8488||20||Was okay for a one off, website states Wednesday is full market so we planned to go on this day on the assumption shouldn't be that busy. If this was a full market then what a waste of time, not many stalls, it smelt of fish and urine whach gave me the idea of unsanitary food. Everything is over priced for example brought 2 sticks of wild boar salami for £7 just came back and brought the same thing (taste tested) for £1.50 in my local Asda. I must say though the coffee from mamouth was very nice and at average cost of Costa/Starbucks but much smaller sized. Breads looked nice but not something I couldn't find in my local Waitrose apart from cheese and olive bread stick £2 which I ate with my salami. My partner enjoyed her German hotdog and her giant cookie which was smaller then what saw on YouTube yet the same price of £2 that enticed us to the market. A tourist trap very similar to Camden but way less quality. Give it a miss there is better foodie markets out there in London!! ||March 9, 2016
K8180KLpauld||40||A fascinating and busy traditional market in the centre of town - a great tourist spot as well as popular with locals. Also next to to Southwark Cathedral and close to the riverside Thames walkway - a jewel of an area south of the river. Be aware that there is partial restoration taking place for the next few months so the accessible area is less for the time being.||March 9, 2016
kristyrebecca||50||I love the borough markets. there's so much yummy food to salivate over. if you're vegetarian there's lots of good options. recently I tried balkan bites. balkan bites is a vegetarian food stall inside the borough markets which serves burekas which are a flaky crispy filo dough stuffed with veggie goodness.there’s four flavours which are potatoes + onions, spinach + cheese, tomato + basil, and plain cheese. you can have the burekas by themselves as a snack or get it in a lunch box meal served with homemade hummus, warm chickpeas, olive oil & chilli paste. I had the spinach + cheese which was delightful. it’s simple food but definitely hits the spot.||March 9, 2016
Dawn L||50||This market is awesome…so many food stalls to choose from, as well as any fresh produce you could want! The airy interior was very pleasant for strolling before sitting down to eat. I highly recommend the pie and mash from Pieminister!||March 8, 2016
verenasc||50||This is a really beautiful food market. You can see a wide range of shops offering local, regional and gourmet foods like special cheese, bread, truffles, spices and much more. Most goods can be tasted and the recommendations from the market people are very good. The market is clean and really beautiful arranged. Recommendation: Try local Gin and chocolate. Very nice and tasty. ||March 8, 2016
FamilyNind||40||Worked up an appetite after lots and lots of steps at various attractions - lots of lovely food stalls - half not there due to refurbishment but wow!!!!!!! spoilt for choice can not wait to go back||March 8, 2016
hazel18Manchester||50||We visited this market on Saturday afternoon unfortunately quite late as it closes at 5 so we didn't get to see it all. But what we did see was great. Lots of stalls selling food. We went in the wine bar which was very nice. Will visit again when we in London but will go earlier so we can see it all. ||March 7, 2016
Menna797||50||Went for Mothers Day with my older kids I thought it was brilliant well worth the good hours journey from home .... shame it was so cold going back on a summers day this year plenty to see and do||March 7, 2016
Aleks C||50||One of the coolest places I went to while staying in London, a must go for everyone, great food and great atmosphere.||March 6, 2016
nomadlad||50||My favourite place in London and the one place I tell people to visit from in or out of town as its just so vibrant and lovely.Good food. Good drinks. Lovely fresh produce, flowers etc.A great market and iconic part of London.||March 6, 2016
Erica H||50||This market is big, bustling and I can't imagine anyone walking out empty handed! In fact, it's hard not to blow your budget on all the wonderful goodies you can find! I especially like the raw goat's milk from Ellie's dairy, the rye sourdough from The Flour Station and the seafood from Shellseekers Fish and Game. Just a great place to walk around and soak in some memorable sights and smells!I prefer markets when they are not too packed with tourists, so I thought Friday morning was an ideal time to visit - all the stalls are open, but there aren't too many people about before 11-11:30.||March 5, 2016

8pairs||50||As food is a passion, one could never tire of Borough Market. A wide range of food, truffles, raspberries, honey - everything you could wish for. Great to look around, although it can be slow moving due to the crowds. I come here every time I'm in London.||March 4, 2016
Gary T||50||Have been several times over being a local but never get bored of the food. Always top quality and can smell it from London Bridge station. Just get there by 11am on a Saturday as it's mental busy. One of best places to visit if on a quick trip. Monmouth coffee and the chorizo roll nearby a must! Expect to spend £5 on every stall then stop off at the George pub after for a pint of estrella! ||March 4, 2016
931RobS||40||Whether you want to drink in the sights or just drink, the market is well worth a visit. A variety of Pubs and restaurants is part of the draw. But then there are the genuine stalls (mostly food) during the day. And the Oyster Bars. And the rumble of trains overhead. Hustle and bustle. Atmosphere. The market is easy to get to - and it's on the way to other places, so you can just drop in and carry on through, whether on a tube, a bike or on foot. Well worth a visit!||March 4, 2016
s_u_n_l_o_v_e_r_8326||50||A must have for any foodie! Delicious food, too much to choose from! I would recommend to any one who enjoys the good quality food. It may not be the cheapest, but you get what you pay for!||March 4, 2016
victusconsult||50||I spend a lot of time in London, always looking for the next new thing when it comes to food, drink and hospitality. Borough Market delivers every single time. From fish and meat to wheatgrass and meringues the stalls are plentiful. Tastings if this and the fresh smell of that just add to the whole experience. Have a brew in the outside cafe with a plate of bubble or grilled melted cheese and an energy shot washed down with fine meats, salamis or cheese. Hours can be spent just wandering around this market. If in London and you have a love of food and drink, it is a must do!! ||March 4, 2016
john l||40||first visit. easy to get to and find. fab choice of quality foods and drinks. great feel and character to the place. but big part currently closed for redevelopment. makes the rest of it even busier. bring a big appetite to really enjoy||March 4, 2016
Hellybop||40||This extensive food market has something for everyone, from tea, coffee to cheese, meats and fish and sweets it has an extraordinary range of stalls. It's an incredible experience to just walk around even if you are not in the market for buying anything.||March 4, 2016
jorgeceb||50||Wonderful, fine quality farmers stalls in Borough Market - Cheese, Charcuterie, Ready to Eat options, Sandwiches from local owners and farmers. Good Pubs around too. This is a recommended treat route for a good value lunch: start by sharing with your couple a sauteed Duck Sandwich (forgot the name, in a corner in front of a Pub), then have a Shrimp or Cajun Fish Taco for 5lr in Applebee's in the street grill (NOT the American Chain, the independently owned Borough restaurant!!!) and for desert walked around the Market and sample all the Fine, Fine Cheeses from all over England. It's a really nice Market for lunch after visiting the Tower of London or the Tate Modern in the morning. The Best Food Market in London!!||March 3, 2016
Jan Y||50||From fresh oysters to artisan cheeses, you can get spices, vegetables, meats, breads, pastries. There's something here for everyone. A must when visiting in London.||March 2, 2016
Andy G||50||We visited on a Tuesday, so a few stalls were closed, but, the ones that were open made our visit worthwhile, everything from fresh veg to artisan cheeses to fresh coffee and tea stalls. If your in London, get the tube to Tottenham court rd, and just round the corner is the market!||March 1, 2016
triciaf_12||50||Despite having visited London many, many times over our lifetimes we had never before been to Borough Market - I suspect it won't be the last time. The diversity of food and drink was fabulous. Unfortunately, for us, we visited on a Friday lunch-time and it was extremely busy and we didn't fancy eating standing up and then finding a drink somewhere else so, on this occasion, we just looked and went somewhere else for lunch but next time we shall be back to partake!!||March 1, 2016
Ndeye L||30||I loved it despite the bad weather it was lively and full of discoveries. There are fruits from all over the globe. Surprising grass smoothies. I was not strong enough to try. I already drink punch of salad but need to process it before next step which is drinking grass‘s smoothie. Maybe at my next review of Borough market. I also discover different teas and the most expensive one! One cup costs £5. Just the content not the cup itself! Maybe on my next visit! It is supposed to be healthy! There were different types of fruits and desserts: like cakes, cookies.||February 29, 2016
Matt T||50||The smells wafting around are really great. So many different food stall with quite a few giving out free samples. The atmosphere is lively and it's always busy. A great way to spend time mocching around. ||February 29, 2016
Owtanabout||50||Food from all continents, some cooked some to take away and cook yourself.Loads of stalls offering cheese, craft beer, chocolate etc.The smells around the market coming from the cooked food makes your mouth water and is irresistible, but what to have ?Some bars, coffee shops etc to sit and people watch too great place to go and while away a few hours and get some great food.||February 29, 2016
Josephine2683||40||Great market with amazing food. We had a lamb burger from the burger stand which was delicious.It is very busy so prepare to be patient.||February 29, 2016
Isaslbc||40||Okay went with a friend on a weekday. It wasn't crowded and all the stalls weren't open early in the morning. What we did see and eat was amazing! had a couple veggie samosas and a peanut jam tart and that was AWESOME! Worth the trip.||February 28, 2016
gaynoroasis||50||First time visit for us and I would highly recommend to all! Loads of stalls with fishmongers, butchers, cheesemongers & florists. Brilliant vibe on a Saturday. You must try 'pieminster' - the perfect British lunch ||February 28, 2016
Daniel C||50||Been here many times trying out the different food stalls for lunch, buying fantastic Parma ham, cheeses, fresh veg and breads and cakes to die for!! Great atmosphere and never disappoints. A must for any foodie out there!||February 28, 2016
EdinburghShoegal||50||One of the best markets I've ever visited. Lots of stalls selling fruit/veg, olives, cheeses, bread, meats, truffles, chocolate and much much more. You can walk around tasting their produce before deciding what you'd like to buy. Lots of little coffee bars dotted around. Well worth a visit. ||February 28, 2016
dannyandshell||50||Always something different, Always something to see, do and experience, taste, smell, sound, sights, what more can I say. London at its best. Watch your pockets and bags, stay on the main streets. Use the Thames clippers to get the most of the river, wonderful day out.||February 27, 2016
nickpotteruk1979||50||This is the 2nd time we've visited the borough market. Each time we've loved it. The food and ingredients are an amazing standard. Great setting. A must if you're in the area. Just make sure you haven't eaten before you go!||February 27, 2016
SarahCorell||50||This market is lovely and colourful.It's good so expect your senses to be awakened by the smells and colourful displays on offerTried a bit of haggling but the venders didn't want to engage Most offered try before you buy on their produce which was appreciated.Great market ||February 27, 2016
Gaynor R||50||Borough market is well worth a visit - even if you are not intent on buying food. The variety of fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and bakery items are wonderful. There are plenty of choices for a light lunch including an opportunity to purchase Prosecco and champagne to accompany your food.||February 27, 2016
emmajade22||50||I love this place. There is so much to eat and see here! I come every time I am in London and this is one of my favorite outdoor markets in the world. Great for lunch as you can grab something and stroll. I recommend coming here with a group so you can try several things. A must see in London. My favorite is the pork belly sandwich at the Roast stall. ||February 26, 2016
abbiet2014||40||We visited Borough Market during a few days away in the City. The food stalls are great and if you like cheese, you're on to a winner!We had the famous cheese toastie, which was amazing. The Ethiopian food stall looked amazing - but the queue was just too long for us! Would definitely recommend :)||February 25, 2016
ZmixVal||40||There is a love to this place, if you really like your food and are a foodie, get to it. Station is the London Bridge Station, and you can try either sea food or nice British pub food. Some great balsamic and cheeses are there. As well as hams. All packed air sealed if you want. Nice building, great food. Take a date.||February 25, 2016
Sandip R||40||Nice famous market very close to our hotel..lotsof amazing food places around this and bit of history to it...||February 25, 2016
Lifeshouldbeaholiday||50||If you haven't been to Borough Market before or if you're visiting London and like your food then you should definitely make the effort to pop along. It's the sort of place that you could spend half an hour or 2 hours wandering around. It's like a huge deli/canteen/butchers/restaurant/ rolled into one. It's great for picking up some ingredients to take home, or pick up snacks, or have a full blown meal. It really does cater for all tastes!It's also possible to have a good nose around and not actually buy anything if you're looking to kill time at no extra cost!||February 25, 2016
GemWA||40||This market had terrific food. Lots of choice and quality was excellent. It was set up in a small street so very easy to walk from end to end looking at everything before making a choice. There was a good choice of sweet and savoury so good place to go if you are really hungry. Pricing wasn't cheap but it was a fun experience.||February 24, 2016
Matt C||50||This huge market close to London Bridge never fails to impress me. The selection of fruits, veggies and street food makes me want to come here every week. It's a good place to pick a few unusual foods to mix up the diet, Just be cautious, it's easy to leave the place with an empty wallet.||February 24, 2016
Crockern||50||I love the wandering about, finding new discoveries and getting lost in a rather small area of food delights. Worth a visit if you've never been before.||February 24, 2016
KITCHES||50||Wow this is more than the average market. It's more like a deli. Every thing you could imagine in the way of food and veg, drinks and more. We had made the mistake of eating before we went, don't ! The outside market has a wonderful selection of fast food, suckling pig, paella, fresh sandwiches, cakes and much more||February 24, 2016
LallySurrey||40||What an assault to the senses!!!! Amazing foods, smells, sights, bustling, noisy & vibrant! My children thought it was wonderful: sampling olives, Turkish Delight & watching paella being cooked in a huge pan! There were so many wonderful foods to try! ||February 24, 2016
zsoke||40||What can you say about this place....one of London's exclusivist and upscale markets full of high quality products. Unfortunately hence prices are high up towards the sky...similar to the Food Hall in Harrods-and this is why I don't rate it 5*. But! I found one thing worth going there for : the stall with exotic meats:crocodile, ostrich, kangaroo,etc. If you are something else, you must go there||February 23, 2016
boris1992||40||I was in London and I had a few hours before I had an appointment. The borough market is a very nice place to be. There are lots of different type of food courts where you can get all sorts of different snacks.Really chill place to be||February 22, 2016
ChampagneChels||50||Lovely for a stroll. Fair warning don't try to drink everywhere...we are not sure you can. Take an extra bag for your purchases and see if you can wander all of it before settling on s meal. ||February 22, 2016
Hanlor||30||I've been to Borough Market quite a few times when visiting London and on a recent visit, can't help but feel its losing its edgy and vibrant feel. Seems to be getting over commercial with more and more big operators rather than artisan producers. On recent trip, then went on to Maltby Street Market in nearby Bermondsey. It's small, but far more interesting for local producers and worth checking out||February 22, 2016
HuggyHotspur||50||One of my favourite places in London. I could spend hours eating here but I don't want to have a heart attack. The street food is superb and the specialist shops are excellent. I highly recommend the scotch eggs with sweet potato fries and one of the cake stalls does the best bread and butter pudding came. Check when you are going as I don't believe it's open every day. ||February 21, 2016
warwickl0cal||40||The market was great with so many different stalls and places to eat and drink. I guess it should be no surprise that towards lunch time it would be so busy you can barely see anything. Would definitely go back earlier in the day and purchase things to take home from many of the stalls including oils, spices, cheese, teas and much much more. Had pad Thai for lunch which was fantastic||February 21, 2016
karb62||50||Really enjoyed my visit to Borough market.Plenty of enticing fresh food from bread to an amazing range of fresh fruit and vegetables. The fresh fish was amazing and enjoyed the fresh oysters! Lots of options to try before you buy - delicious chicken pate and amazing range of cheeses. Stall holders were friendly and no pressure to buy. I did stock up on my herbs and spices. My son used the lovely mackerel- beetroot and horseradish to prepare a lovely starter with soda bread.The choice of street food is also very varied - our bbq chicken wraps were excellent value and very tasty.A great visit even if like us you are on holiday and cannot buy much of the fresh food - a lovely experience and plenty of interest and inspiration||February 21, 2016
cressettes||50||What can I say about this place? A collection of stalls serving all kinds of food both traditional British and from around the World. On this visit I went for the Chicken Shwama which was as good as I remember them being in the Middle East. Just watch out if you have small children or a push chair. This is a full on market and gets very busy so maybe not the best place if you want to avoid hustle and bustle at lunch.||February 21, 2016
KVJ166||50||What's not to love about Borough Market, fabulous fare at really reasonable prices. We visited to fuel ourselves for a busy day in the city visiting a show and then shopping. The choice of food is endless, there is something for everyone, all fresh and the smell of produce cooking is divine!||February 21, 2016
Z6385RDdawnb||50||Saturday afternoon spent wandering around the market. Tasting food looking at food drinking warm cider. This is food heaven. We went Saturday at the end of the month and the atmosphere was brilliant. Everyone so friendly and willing to talk about the food on sale. Hot food being made from kebabs to bread to muscles. A truly great experience. Called in a local pub on the edge of the market which was also buzzing. Even if you don't buy anything this market is well worth a wander. ||February 21, 2016
RexS324||50||This market is very mpressive, probably better than most I have seen in the world. You will find purveyors ranging from the finest cheese to Zebra burger patties!!! Definitely worth a visit. However it can be a little crowded, so you need time and patience to ensure you visit all the market stalls. I love the fact that most stalls offer free samples, so you can be sure you like what you buy. There are so many food options to taste / eat so you need to make sure you know what to eat in case you find something better later on your walk.||February 20, 2016
shmerlock91||50||We could have spent hours wandering around the market and still wanted to try more of what was on offer! Wonderful atmosphere, and food to die for! We visited for breakfast, it was a little (a very little!) quieter meaning we didn't struggle to move around as much!||February 20, 2016
windstarID||40||We happened upon this market accidentally, and what a find it is. All sorts of eats and drinks. Very crowded when we visited. Open air, but out of the rain. One could spend a lot of time and money at this market. ||February 20, 2016
A4610UJtonyb||40||This is something of an institution and feels it, with an air of confidence and permanence mixed with the fashionable, the ephemeral and the just passing through. The customers are a similar mixture, regulars mixed with casual visitors (like us) and tourists. Not cheap but generally authentic and real, with quality to the fore. Cheeses and charcuterie with a bias to France and Spain (artisanal), meat and fish, mulled cider and wine, fresh breads, plenty to eat on the spot: some of it more appetising-looking than other. One of the buskers had a varied repertoire and (for a while) a coterie of excited girls, which added atmosphere. We were there on a Wednesday lunchtime and it was busy: what it must be like in peak times hardly bears thinking about, but if you like the sights and smells of varied fresh foods it is well worth a visit.||February 20, 2016
mulia||40||This market is close to London Bridge. A lot of variety of foods in the market. Have to come with empty stomach to taste all the foods. Love it. Will go there again if I visit London.||February 20, 2016
Heidi L||50||Whatever foodwise takes your fancy it is here - these markets have operated for hundreds of years and they are amazing.||February 19, 2016
Lilaclady_13||40||So much to see, lots of smells and aromas wafting through the air. Lots of people.I went around 3pm on Friday and the place was heaving with people. Eating places of every sort of cuisine, every dish a treat and the spices and seasoning waft throught thewhole area. You will be spoilt for choice of what to eat.||February 19, 2016
chloe187111||50||This market is a good place to have Quick lunch, many kind of food it Was a good time ' I recommand This place !||February 19, 2016
DidiKwok||40||A great city market. If you have time, can go there enjoy the food. There are many choices. The food are all nice and the people there are very friendly. Remember prepare an empty stomach.||February 19, 2016
Adrián B||50||Borough Market is just one of those places that makes a food fall in love. It has it all, from vegetables to cheeses, fine meats, fine wines, cakes, sea-food, Spanish cuisine, organic, burgers …you name it. But take into account it's packed on Saturday! Loads of tourists and locals come here to enjoy the variety and great prices. You have to arrive early if you want to explore this amazing place in peace. There is so much to see and taste... A great market!||February 19, 2016
leannedancer||50||Great buzzing atmosphere, great for a wonder around and definitely worth grabbing a hot cider on a cold day.We picked up meat, bread, beer, brownies, veg whilst we were there but also good just to soak up the atmosphere. ||February 19, 2016
Barry W||50||The market rambles so left hand maze rule is my approach to not miss a thing. There are fantastic veg stalls where we found Japanese Artichokes (amazing little things), superb patisserie stalls where we found French caneles (truly amazing little things). Plus I bought some truffle butter and fresh cappelletti to take home (which were, you guessed it incredibly amazing little things). Lots of cooking food smells at the fast food stalls from around the world so you won't go hungry and lots of mulled wine and cider around at this time of year. V. Fun||February 19, 2016
Salma_bh||50||Everytime I visit London I make it a point to spend a morning at Boroughs market! The cheese, the tasters, olives, more cheese, fruits and veggies galore!! Its always buzzing! This time I had the spanish Paella for lunch which was so tasty and warm on such a cold day in February.. The green juices are amazing!! Don't miss it!||February 18, 2016
debbie h||50||If you love city markets then make sure you check out the Borough Market. It is packed with all sorts of great things you would expect in a market and many unexpected things as well. It was a highlight of my day in London. Warm mulled wine with a shot of whiskey and a zebra burger! Huge assortment of meats, cheeses, breads, oils, wines, flowers, sandwiches, smoothies, vegetables, etc. etc. etc. I went on a Saturday just after noon and it was crazy crazy packed. If you don't like crowds then don't do this. A local told me to go first thing when they open and the place is empty...I would try that next time. ||February 18, 2016
Sugar V||50||Decided to go for wander round and get some dinner inspiration... was here for hours - so much too see, so many tasters! So much fun but a little pricey :p Go to the spice stall!!||February 18, 2016
Catherine E||50||If you are a foodie like me DO NOT MISS the Borough food market. it is hands down, one of the best food markets I have ever been to. Imagine having this on your door step every day, I would love it! I spent hours going around it, its not just the range & choice of food, its how its displayed, meeting friends, having a drink, trying new food, picking up a snack...........take my advice & just hop on a tube & head there. You will regret it if you dont.||February 18, 2016
Christine E||50||Huge variety of tasty food, you will not be able to taste them all so go there starving! They will try to convince you to buy more take away but what matters is the live experience. Just make sure to read opening and closing hours..||February 18, 2016
4sld||50||This was my third trip to the Borough Market. Such a great place to visit, with all the food stalls of exotic fayre, Hot and cold food to eat straight away huddled in a crush of all sorts of people...tourists and locals alike. Lots of artisan breads, cheeses, olive olils, spices, you name it! Great fo food and people watching||February 17, 2016
Kokoroko||50||Being a Londoner you get kind of spoiled with the vast array of places to eat there are so many great culinary experiences to be had , the problem is often too many places not enough time..Well why not just go to the fantastic Borough Market where you can sample loads of great types of cuisine from Meats to Cheeses , sweets , cakes , Wine , Coffee the list goes on and on..I have lost track of how many times my family and I have been to Borough Market but one things for sure we LOVE IT and cant wait to go back and stock up on some amazing food..Fantastic atmosphere great choice and great value 10/10 Win.||February 17, 2016
Andy B||50||If you died of obesity and went to fat man's heaven.. This would be the place.Although the stalls mainly consist of cheese and meat there are many varieties of foods from all over the world here. I wouldn't recommend coming on an empty stomach as you may concede to the temptations of many different foods and smells, which can leave a big hole in your pocket.If you already have holey pockets and can't afford the market's food.. Fear not. There are ample amounts of free samples constantly being dished out - you may have to entertain the idea of actually buying some of the produce in order to keep the supplies coming. You consider actually buying stuff too.. These people are trying to make a living after all||February 17, 2016
myriamldr||50||Stalls shut down at 5pm so make sure you get there with more than one hr to look around as some stalls will begin shutting down earlier. It's a good place for all kinds of eats, plenty to just stare at, and a good melting pot of cultures and languages. Sellers are also friendly and happy to point you in the right direction. ||February 17, 2016
Rebecca G||40||This is a great market to buy specialised goods as well as fruit and veg. We spent an hour walking round tasting cheese, jams, pickles etc. If this market was on my doorstep I would be a regular visitor.||February 17, 2016
Happy-To-Wander||40||A cold Saturday afternoon in the winter and drizzle. Maybe we picked the wrong day. It was absolutely rammed full of people. I certainly didn't bother taking any photos until late afternoon when it started to quieten down. We really were just squeezing past people to get around.Plenty of different stall, sights & smells. Different Worldly goods. I made it my mission to eat & drink various odd/different things that I've not tried before. Eating Ostrich, Crocodile & Zebra was a first! Not that I'll be rushing back for more.If you fancy trying different things or need ingredients for an eclectic dinner party, you'll not be disappointed here!Worth a visit.||February 17, 2016
VanCan2012||50||So many choices of delicious food! It was fun way to have lunch and spend the afternoon wandering around. Plus there are lots of samples to try.It is outside, so in the cooler months you must bundle up. ||February 17, 2016
wapahapa||50||There's a great variety of food stalls here, I would recommend sampling from as many as possible. Definitely check out the Turkish delights, apple cider, cheeses and meats. Can get pretty crowded at lunchtime.||February 16, 2016
scotth931||50||This is defiantly work a visit, the vibe is great and food is even better. So many different food items to choose from. Can be very crowded on weekends but it's London!! ||February 16, 2016
kat_monty||40||Very busy but enjoyed walking around the stalls and sampling the cuisine! Would go back again! Loved the cookies and burgers!||February 16, 2016
marcovanbatty||50||Must-visit place to go to if you love food. Make sure you go when there is a full market on (check the website). Chock full of varied food stalls, many giving out free tasters - bits of cheese, spoonfulls of paella, freshly baked bread etc. A fab place to visit for lunch - I would be here every day if I worked nearby. Be warned though - it gets very busy and there isn't much room to manoeuvre and nowhere to sit down unless you come out of the market.||February 16, 2016
millyWarwickshire||40||visited borough market with friends who bought some cheese a great market for buying fresh produce fish cheese meat etc whilst some of the stalls were not open there was still a nice atmosphere there were places to get hot food and all of them allowing you to have a taster the chees stall where our friends got some speciallity chees from was very accomadating allowing you to try before you buy we had abreakfst at the little Dorrit cafe just outside the market and it was great, red hot and lovely fresh products and a great cup of tea really good value as well i have tried to review the cafe seperate but it doesnt come up on trip adviser||February 16, 2016
IroVr||40||Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the prices. Everything was overpriced in my opinion, which was the reason I didn't try as many things as I wanted.If you don't care about money, it's a great place to taste everything you've dreamed of. There are countless stands with good food and drinks.||February 15, 2016
Nathan T||50||The Borough Market is fantastic for anyone from a home cook looking for nice ingredients through to full on foodies. The range of premium provendors is truly outstanding, with butchers, charcuteries, greengrocers, bakers, fishmongers, and cheesemongers in abundance, all selling top notch products. While the products are outstanding, you do pay for that quality, this won't be a cheap shopping trip.All the vendors we interacted with were friendly and obliging, happy to provide advice on prep and cooking some of the more unique products.I would recommend a small breakfast before coming along as there are plenty of taste-testings and samples to fill you up.The only con are the crowds, I highly recommend getting there early. Last time we were there at Saturday opening (8 am) we almost had the place to ourselves, not even all the vendors were ready to go yet, but by about 10:30 am the place was packed and just moving around the market was difficult.||February 15, 2016
sacredgypsy||50||OMG. .. This place is off the scale.. everything you could possibly want and MOREEEEEE. .. cakes, slices, Danish, muffins, pies and wide variety and selection of cheeses, fruit, veg, drinks, fresh flowers, coffee, chocolate etcI walked around in about 4 hours. But I pretty much stopped at every stall..now I'm stuffed!!! YUMMO||February 15, 2016
Andyg020||50||Have been a couple of times now, and must remember not to eat before going - the variety and quality of food on offer is excellent and you could seriously kiss any diet goodbye.... whilst a small market it is good for a half day visit.... just go hungry and you wont be disappointed||February 15, 2016
Jab24||50||Went there to find something to eat for lunch and wasn't disappointed. In fact there was too much choice, this is not usually a problem as I am vegetarian and those two words don't usually go in the same positive sentence. If I was staying in London in a self catering apartment this is the place I would visit. The never ending array of fruit and veg, meat, fish, cheeses was outstanding. Definitely worth a visit at lunch time especially, but expect to queue as I think most of the London workers see to ascend there too. ||February 14, 2016
taylea||50||What a great place to see, smell and try a rich variety of foods from all different places. Wander round and savour the aromas as lots of the food is being cooked as you pass. ||February 14, 2016
rhiandaisy||40||I love this place, the food is as great as the atmosphere and I always find something I've never tried before!!I wouldn't advise it if you're not a fan of crowds but if you want to try something new in the hustle and bustle of the city then go here!||February 14, 2016
baldilocks_13||40||Nice market with free samples of bread, hams, cheese,olives and the like.had a couple of hot spiced wine.which warms you up on a cold day.good way to kill an hour,before going up the shard.||February 14, 2016
stebri||40||My wife and I visited the market on a rainy Monday in February. Some stalls were closed and that was a little disappointing. Nevertheless, there was still a nice atmosphere and just looking at and smelling the fare on offer. At one point we passed in front of a stall selling freshly-made pasta and were going to give it a miss as we live in a country where pasta is daily fare. We were however offer a taste of small ravioli with cheese and white truffle filling and were blown away. In a corner of the market you will find the smaller, mobile stalls and that is where the most eclectic choice of food gets sold. You start off from British food and visit European delicacies (the Balkan stall looked yummy), on to South America and Asia. In the end, we went for the white truffle mini ravioli and a scrumptuous stake and ale pie with mash, mushy peas and gravy. They made for a delicious lunch experience when sitting at the available common tables under the large canopy sheltering us from the rain and wind.||February 14, 2016
720hassan||40||Very good Market with huge facilities..Big number of restaurants, cafes and kiosks that serve amazing types of tasty foods..So nice and highly recommended for people visiting London ||February 13, 2016
JillConnecticut||40||Watch giant pans of paella and curry simmering as hungry shoppers draw near. Wonderful baked goods, meats, fresh fish and meats. If you live and cook around here, fine. Tourists just have to nibble what they ca. N place to sit and enjoy unless you go to the one restaurant, Fish.||February 13, 2016
185jillym||50||Don't eat before you go as there are lots and lots of street food stalls from burgers to noodles to veggie options. Loads of choice of artisan foods and special purchases. Nederland cover too which was a nice surprise||February 13, 2016
John W||40||Right by the river an interesting little bit of old London. However we got there a bit to early(10ish)and vendors were still setting up go at lunchtime. Lots of interesting artisan type foods for sale.||February 13, 2016
comet14||40||Arrived about 11 on a Weds in February.Quite quiet.Some stall ares closed . Those open mainly foreign cheese ,olives ,oils then the ones I expected ,veg and fish and take away food stalls .Went for a coffee nearby and when we came out it was much busier with people queuing for lunches .Wheatsheaf pub across road very nice .Probably better to visit on a Sat and in Spring /Summer ||February 12, 2016
Sarah M||50||Visited the market for the first time with friends on a Friday morning and loved the experience of walking round the various stalls tasting samples and talking to the stall holders about their produce. The value and quality of the food is the real selling point and it was great to pick up items that you wouldn't usually find in delis or supermarkets. It was also good to get lunch at one of the many street food stalls, again we found this to be great value and were happy to stand and watch the world go by while we tucked into some amazing dishes like roasted pork and salt beef sandwiches. Having been to many food markets in my time I think Borough holds its own against some of the more famous European offerings and I actually thought it was a lot better and had more choice than Barcelona’s La Boqueria. If you’re a fellow food lover then it’s a great way to spend a few hours and you can pick up some great treats, just make sure you pack the credit card and a cooler bag!||February 12, 2016
LukV460||50||What a surprise, so many food specialties and deli on one square. Be warned, when you go there when you are hungry .... on your own risk ...||February 11, 2016
iga0||50||If you are a foodie its the number one place to visit in London! You will find locals but as well international stands with food from all over the world, freely prepared! You get a chance to try a lot of different samples. There is a fresh seafood and fish, great spanish stands, french cheeses! Sweet and yum desserts. Pictures on the internet do not lie!||February 11, 2016
Avallach1140||50||It is very pleasant to take a stroll through Borough Market when "fully opened" (Wednesday through Saturday). Sunday it is closed, and the other days the opened shops are restricted.There are a lot of different things to see, lots of local specialties, which are always interesting to see.All in all, a very interesting stop when in London (and it is possible to eat for 2 persons for 10£ or less, see my review of Tua Pasta, a real luxury in London!).||February 10, 2016
Carol G||50||We spent an interesting morning here, so much to see. Truffles, (fungal) can be seen and sniffed, purchased also if you can afford it. Wonderful selection of cheeses.||February 10, 2016
Chloe G||50||No trip to London would be complete for me without a trip to a market. I spent many of my weekends as a teenager in Camden shopping my way through the stalls, eating and drinking tea. This time I graduated to foodie haven Borough Market.Nestled beneath the arches of London Bridge, Borough Market is a market of two personalities. On the one side, the indoor part of the market is full to the rafters of food producers, suppliers and importers. From butchers to cheesemakers, craft beer sellers to a guy claiming to make the best doughnuts in London, whatever your passion, you'll find something that takes your fancy. For me, its charcuterie and cheese.I picked up a lovely hunk of Bresaola and a wild boar salami, before moving on to one of the many cheese stalls to grab a slice of my favourite cheese, French Comte.Outside on the other side of the market, it is bustling with street food traders serving dishes from all over the world. British classics sit alongside African staples. Chinese noodle bars rub along with grilled cheese sandwich sellers. Its a cacophony of sounds, smells and temptation. On the recommendation of my cousin, who lives just around the corner from Borough Market, we went for a Scotch Egg from Scotchtails.This was a little beauty, with a thin, crispy coating, juicy pork and a soft cooked egg, served on a bed of rocket, generously seasoned with salt and cracked black pepper. The egg was enough for me, but they also come with a side of sweet potato fries for the dedicated.It is a little touristy at weekends but still definitely worth a trip for the fantastic produce. ||February 10, 2016
World_Shopper1||50||I've been visiting Borough Market for years and it really is 'London's Larder'. Sited underneath railway bridges and squeezed up against Southwark Cathedral, it's a glimpse of an artisan London which is increasingly difficult to find. It's busy, noisy, sometimes a bit shabby around the edges but full of character and a source of some of the best organic food. Other reviewers have listed what's on offer - everything from organic fruit and veg to Sicilian olive oil, Swiss cheese, home-made jams etc My favourites are 'Bread Ahead' for the freshest sourdough bread baked in workshops overlooking the nearby Southwark Cathedral (and their freshly baked salted caramel doughnuts are a must too); Wild Beef for the freshest eggs (trust me); Paul at Sussex Fish who brings the day's catch to Borough up from the south coast (plus Paul invariably has a mixed tape of 70's music blaring away as he works); the Cool Chile Company for your Mexican BBQ (chipotle paste, fresh corn tortillas, jalapeno peppers); Spice Mountain for an astonishing range of spices and peppers; The Olive Oil Co for peppery olive oil; and Monmouth Coffee for bags of beans to grind at home. It gets incredibly busy here at weekends with visitors roaming the stalls for snacks and street food, so if you are here to shop try and arrive before 10h30. This market makes you excited about food again...||February 10, 2016
Tierney M||50||Borough Market, London’s most famous food market, is a real gem. It offers a wide selection of local and international food as well as a fun and friendly atmosphere. I would recommend walking around to see your options before deciding on your meal. I personally liked Roast Hog’s roll with roast pork, apple sauce, rocket and crackling though La Tua Italia also has great fresh pasta. Tip: go on a Saturday for the best food options and atmosphere.||February 9, 2016
Stockeronholiday||40||Great lively and interesting place to experience all things foodie with all sorts of smells, tastes and sights and plenty of visitors from all around the globe.||February 9, 2016
Grethe197||50||Wery good food market near London Bridge. Shop your fresh veggies or have your lunch here. Many different foods to choose from. The whole famile found some food they wanted from different food stalls.||February 9, 2016
vcarreras2015||40||It is a bit cliche but very true in this case, Borough Market has something for everyone. You can buy your dinner for the evening, a handmade soap present for a friend, have excellent food on the go or even sit down in one of the adjoining restaurants. It is a place I often forget and regularly stumble upon. Not just for tourists, if you live in London and have not been yet, it is worth a couple of hours of your time.||February 9, 2016
Lt648||40||Having seen the market on lots of cookery shows I was really looking forward to visiting. The market was a lot smaller than expected however the produce available was varied with some very unusual products. The stalls make a great effort with their displays so it is well worth a wander around and many give free samples so you can graze as you walk around too.||February 9, 2016
lorrainer186||40||Great vibe. Amazing array of food to purchase to eat or take away. It's in a great location lots of places to visit and then pop in here for a bite to eat.||February 9, 2016
Tony J||50||Can't travel to London and not visit this market! It's just a beautiful thing, the sites, the stalls, the pubs, smells, food, wow. It's a shame there's nothing like this in Boston (Faneuil Hall the closest but no cigar, not even close) or New York (you would think so, right? Nope!). The cheeses and salamis and breads and coffee and well, everything! Enjoy.||February 9, 2016
Londirish||40||Revamped and restyled over the last 10 years this market has everything you can think off. I would advise on getting there early if you don't like crowds!! Its a place that buzzes with numerous places to eat. The stalls vary, but you will find fast food, butchers, fishmongers, wine, beer, sweets, Spanish produce, Italian produce, cheese, bread, tea... well almost anything..There are few pubs and wine bars to sit in when the feet get weary and a visit to Borough Market wouldn't be the same without popping into the Market Porter for a swift half. There are restaurants to refresh the batteries in and just sit an people watch. If you don't visit London often, then I would recommend starting here and walking along the Southbank taking in the views of London, the Tate Modern and the festival hall as you go.||February 9, 2016
videomarkw||40||A real must for all foodies. Situated about 100m from London bridge tube. There is a massive selection of stalls selling the most incredible range of domestic and world foods. Brilliant place to pick up that difficult to get item or try something that you never knew existed. Prices can be a bit on the high side and it is nearly always massively busy but if you love food you will love Borough Market||February 9, 2016
Sazood||40||Excellent quality food and drinks to suit and taste. Try the salted beef and prosecco. Also take home some great fruit and veg to continue your experience ||February 9, 2016
Yashna A||50||always excellent food and deserts :) and I treated myself to mulled wine! I'd recommend a woman that sells wild animal burgers (kangaroo, buffalo)||February 9, 2016
Megan2757||50||Fantastic food! Our first visit to London and we stumbled upon these markets. A fantastic selection of fresh fruits, breads, cheeses, olives, honey, sweets, nuts, curries etc.. Well worth a visit. Tastings available. We purchased some bread, cheeses, cured meats and fruit for our dinner, added a bottle of wine and were in heaven!||February 8, 2016
Asrar_md||40||A wonderful way to spend weekend morning or afternoon. Walk around the market and you'll find freshly prepared food, of different types. If you like to cook as well, you'll certainly find great ingredients all around you. ||February 8, 2016
CarolineSMelbourne||50||This area of London was to be avoided in my childhood, but now it is trendy, edgy, up-and-coming and it has Borough Market!! I was last here 5 years ago and it has grown in size and popularity since then. The market is wedged under a roof and railway arches next to London Bridge tube, Southwark Cathedral and Guys Hospital, just a stone's throw from the Thames. If you can spare the time walk here along the river and enjoy the scenery, Golden Hind etc along the way. If there is one thing that you need to take with you to Borough Market it is an appetite. You will find game meat, enormous wheels of cheese, vegetables, flowers, cooked food of many types [Reindeer Burgers in December!], bread, cakes, chocolates, wine, olives, more wheels of cheese and many, many take away food stalls - I feel hungry remembering it all!The market gets VERY crowded. Monday and Tuesday there is a 'Lunch Market' only. On the other days the full market is open and the best time to arrive is 10am when you can walk around before the hoards arrive.||February 8, 2016
826laura||50||a must for London visitors,amazing food stalls and mouthwatering things to try.don't rush to buy from the first stall as there is loads to see and sample!||February 8, 2016
suzy83travelabout||50||There is literally something for everyone in this fantastic market. Simply great, busy, bustling, alive! You can eat in the park or at a table. Food for all tastes... and good quality!||February 8, 2016
jch110||50||Quite a big market near to London Bridge. Mostly undercover. A massive selection of stalls sellling the usual market produce with the addition of so many stalls with takeaway food covering all areas of the world including sushi, goat curries, raclette, sausage and pork rolls, spanish,italian, indian and a whole host more. Also wine and cider stalls and a few real London pubs. Great experience for someone who doesn't visit London very often to see such a busy market with people sitting around enjoying all sorts of food.||February 8, 2016
Philip P||40||If you like good food this is definitely the market to go to you are truly spoilt for choices here. Do not go to Borough Tube though it's right opposite London Bridge so save yourself a walk. Remember to take some bags you will definitely buy more than you expect ||February 8, 2016
foody12345376||40||Wow my first time here and I loved it. Although very busy the place is amazing. It's full of very well presented stalls sellimg food with plenty of tasters to try before you buy. We sampled many different cheeses, salamis, oils before buying a sausage baguette and a glutenfree cake. Would definetly recommend IT.||February 7, 2016
emzhemzk||50||Amazing range of different food to eat or ingredients to buy from around the world. You could easily spend a few hours here if you wanted to look at everything in detail. ||February 7, 2016
LaurynM430||50||We visited here on a Saturday morning when it was already bustling and the air full of beautiful smells. The choice of food is so wide and there is something to suit everyone from fresh juices and smoothies, lots of different meats, cheeses, cakes and pastries (including gluten free), sweets, alcohol and more. We wish we had come with an empty stomach! I would love to return next time I'm in London.||February 7, 2016
mperugia||50||Wow! Phenomenal street cuisine! I tried olives, vegetarian Indian food, cheeses, and juice from the various vendors. The market was busy and buzzing with people which added to the excitement. I will go back next time I'm in London. ||February 7, 2016
macey00||40||Me and my friend went on a Saturday, it was soo busy you could barely move. The stands were good, lots to see and we got to see some veg that we've never seen before. Overall, I would go back but not on a Saturday. ||February 7, 2016
JEM1180||50||A vibrant market full of exciting food and drink; you can find anything you want there! Incredible roast baps and fish and chips found in the middle. Well worth a visit! ||February 7, 2016
Sardin A||50||This is a lovely market, where you can taste some traditional British snacks (pork specialities etc.). I recommend you eat some ice-cream at the Gelateria 3BIS afterwards (just in front of the market).||February 7, 2016
901traceyy||50||Some of the best food displays in the world, a real showcase of British cuisine. Game, seafood and vegetables from local suppliers as well as other interesting things to see. Extraordinarily busy on Saturdays when there are lots of extra stalls doing interesting cooked foods. If you love food you MUST see this place!||February 6, 2016
cristinasegar||50||Londoners are so lucky! Street food was incredible and affordable, especially when you're traveling with kids and trying not to blow your budget. There's something for everyone whether you're a meat lover or vegetarian. Go early though because it gets crowded and that can be difficult to navigate when you have young kids. Don't bother with a buggy, too crowded. ||February 6, 2016
177kristinaf||50||Amazing variety of tasty food and drink. Visited on a Saturday afternoon an it was a bit crowded but the atmosphere was great. If I lived in London I would want to go every week! ||February 6, 2016
PBMCM||50||Fantastic place, has items, food, and shops from all over. Variety of foods was spectacular. Was easy to get to via the tube.||February 6, 2016
62AndyS62||40||Surprisingly up market offering in scruffy Southwark. Well presented and good selections of many types of sausages, seafood, meats and ready cooked snacks. Personal favourite was a stall offering a huge range of spices, from which we purchased several. Enjoyable and close to Borough tube.||February 6, 2016
PeteandAly||50||Cannot believe we haven't been here before, lovely produce market selling great and high quality fruit/veg, meats, fish, cheeses, honey, jams etc plus so much choice of food and drinks - great day out. Close to The Shard, Tower of London and the river to add to the great day out.||February 5, 2016
tom_overing||50||So much good food to choose from, I could not decide! Gets busy around lunchtime but has a proper market feel. Some indoor areas and some outdoor areas. Very pleased I stumbled across this market, would definitely visit again.||February 5, 2016
Marju S||50||Market is full of food stalls. Vendors sell fresh fish, vegetables, fruits, juices, cheese, meat and also delicious street food. You should go hungry for breakfast or lunch. Food cost about 5£.||February 5, 2016
wjarma||40||A very special market with amazing fresh food from all over Britain, Europe and the World. We bought several items to take home,superb pies, meat, French cheese and a haggis. On the Saturday morning when we went it was very busy. There were endless outlets for food to eat "on the hoof" but as we have limited walking, we would have loved the chance to sit somewhere and take in the great atmosphere over a drink in the market which was not possible.||February 4, 2016
farrowp||50||It's a while since I have been here. This area has turned into a. Foodies heaven so many cheese stalls food from around both uk and world best fruit fish salad artisan breads and meats, topped with lots of eateries and bars to suit every pocket. Even as a tourist you should take a visit as the history of how this area was once the major markets of London is great, did you know also that one of the Bridget Jones movies was filmed here too . Close by to many tourist attractions also such as the link museum and the go,den hind so combine the visit. Have fun ||February 4, 2016
MYDOGISFINN||40||Borough Market is about as far removed from the dismal street markets of small town Britain as you can get. It is even several ranks above the average Farmers Market. It reminded me of markets in France with its emphasis on well displayed local produce, freshness and vast choice. There seemed to be a 50/50 split between street food stalls of every nationality and food and drink outlets ranging from Swiss cheese to Croatian charcuterie. The food outlets are not cheap but you are getting quality and in many cases uniqueness. It was not as big as I imagined and does tend to sprawl around various streets rather than being contained in a central hall. Well worth a visit but don't expect any bargains.||February 4, 2016
Lee R||50||My fiancée introduced me to this foodie heaven, and I am so pleased that she did.Fresh artisan food at every turn, this hub of culinary excellence must be on your todo list if you like food. Like many places of this pedigree, the food is a little on the high end of average, but certainly worth every penny. The basil olive oil I bought is now a firm favourite of mine, and I'd certainly give the venison burgers another chomp!||February 3, 2016
138lyndat||50||When in London, we always make sure to head to Borough Market. Open every day from 8am - 5pm, closed on Sundays. Nearest Station is London Bridge (literally leaves you across the street).Here's a market that is full of wonderful foods and a vast variety of items you can eat on the spot. Our favorites are the wonderful toasted cheese sandwiches and fresh hot pasta dishes! YUM! London really is an international city so you can find almost any type of food there - lots of gluten free/vegetarian/vegan/meat options. This is not a market with handcrafted souvenirs - although you can find shops surrounding the market with those items. This is truly a food market in the best sense!||February 3, 2016
poppitshelby||50||WOW what an experience!The sights, smells and sounds of this market are fantastic - The tastes even better!A must go place to grab a bite to eat and experience a proper London market!||February 2, 2016
gauravs09||50||A whole lot of eating options .. hand-made fudge, pastries - especially the ones without flour .. greek wraps .. Indian fare .. fresh juices .. etc. A must-visit place when in London.||February 1, 2016
ritchie20142015||50||Was surprised at the size of the market and range of products. All the food stalls looked and smelled amazing. You have to be prepared to queue but will find it worth the wait. We had fantastic burgers. The range of meats , fish, and veg is excellent as well as spice, alcohol and healthy option stalls. Will definitely go back next time I'm in London and eat my way around the market||February 1, 2016
brockster43||50||Visited the market on Sat 30/01/16 me and my wife are foodies and this was perfect , lots of fresh veg to buy and other stalls that sold quality cheese , olive oil,bread,wine,mushrooms just about anything you want,good takeaway food stalls too which we sampled ||February 1, 2016
GuyJohannesburg||50||Borough market is somewhere you go when you have no idea what you would like to eat, drink or cook. It is a market teaming with food and drinks from a multitude of countries ranging from Latin America to Europe and beyond. From the Dutch raclette to the Scottish Haggis, you can find pretty much most delicacies here. I can strongly recommend getting to the market, grab an delicious coffee and then stroll around whilst your eyes start to take in the many delicious dishes on offer. Try the cheeses, taste the cured meats and then start making up your mind as to what you would like to eat. Look out for the homemade black truffle pasta, the handmade gins and many other delicious treats. If you are looking for a deal consider visiting the market about an hour before it closes when often many of the stores start running specials as they need to get rid of their fresh produce. A great place to spend a few hours.||February 1, 2016
jennydroitwich||50||We enjoyed our visit to the market and it lived up to expectations. Make sure you visit the outside market, lots of stalls and a wide variety of food.||February 1, 2016
Arch B||50||I love this Market, I go here very often, the atmosphere is great particularly around the festive season. The workers are very friendly, offering great food such as burgers, sausages and paella. It is very cosmopolitan with many cuisines such as Thai, Indian Turkish, Italian, Spanish and French and German.||February 1, 2016
PBDavid||50||Give me a chair and table and I would be in heaven. This place is everything I expected and more. OK some things were not at good (Egyptian street food) but others were (Oysters, cheese, spices, wine........... I could go on).We have heard of people travelling from the Midlands to this place and thought WHY! Now I know why and would make the journey myself without hesitation a true 5 out of 5.||February 1, 2016
Alexia Z||50||We loved visiting Borough Market. It doesn't feel much like a market, but rather somewhere you can get quality food, drink and ingredients. You could easily spend half a day there having breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert and coffee. We would definitely go to the market again. ||February 1, 2016
180Stef||40||Went there 2 times with my wife, we love this place, gets pretty crowded after 1pm but you find very good food there, from ethiiopian to indian, to burgers or seafood, everything there is extremely well done and you will leave stuffed !!! ||February 1, 2016
TripMember073020151||50||Stumbled across the market whilst walking around Southwark. An amazing range of foods that has helped us to decide that when next in London we will rent a flat and buy our goods from the Borough Market - they looked that nice!! (Avoid the nearby patisserie though, 4 pounds for a cup of coffee was a rip off).||January 31, 2016
254dcg||50||Could have walked round for hours if I had bottomless pockets. A little pricy for the tourist population, but well worth a visit. A lot of quirky stall and quality goods. Stalls are full of interesting produce and many are keen to temp you with samples tasters and a potted history. Very impressed. Even a few well positioned taverns assist the experience. We will go again.||January 31, 2016
ishouldcocouk||50||Lots of yummy food and produce vendors - expect to pay over the odds for many things though - this is London!||January 31, 2016
RachelPenarth||40||Great fun to wander around though predictably busy and not brilliant with a buggy! A real visual treat, a bit pricey for snacking but also some good prices for ingredients if you scout them out. Try Roma Express in the tunnel leading down to the market for super friendly service & a big plate of tasty Moroccan kebab style grill - brilliant value lunch if the market's a bit out of your price range!||January 31, 2016
simply-peregrinating||50||Easily accessed close to the Thames, Southwark Cathedral and London Bridge underground with plenty of bus stops nearby. This compact, tidy food market sells produce not only from the UK but also from abroad. Lots of gourmet food and fresh produce to buy. Wednesday to Saturday is the full market, Mondays and Tuesdays there's lots of food outlets alongside fruit and vegetables. Note well it's closed Sundays. Lots of tasty snacks or takeaways to pick up or stop by in one of the several eateries. Like all the best places worth visiting it gets very busy especially around lunchtime.||January 31, 2016
mikelindley||30||Visited Borough Market as it is on my list of must do's. I work in London regularly but have never managed to find the time to go along before. The market was certainly busy on a Saturday. However I was disappointed with the selection of food on offer. Despite the artisan bread and cheese stalls there was little evidence of good British food. Where are the pork pies, black pudding, stilton and British cheeses etc.Great if you want anything not British with the exception of some organic fruit and veg. Didn't see one jellied eel or any pie and mash. ||January 30, 2016
32jenny||50||i have allways wanted to visit borough market,and so yesterday I did,what an amazing place,the sights the smells the numerous tastings,and the most diverse food all under one roof .for lunch we had an artisan soft scotch egg with rocket and sweet potatoe fries,superb is the only word needed,it was my first visit but defiantly won't be my last.||January 30, 2016
Joanna O||50||You can find any food you want and it's fresh and amazing. Fresh press juice, oysters, olives and anything else you would think of.||January 30, 2016
K-Dizzle18||30||I was really looking forward to coming here after reading the positive reviews. Unfortunately we ended up here at lunch time. It was soooo busy. Unpleasantly so. If this is being marketed as a tourist attraction then they need to sort out how busy it gets. Though I do think this is not its usual position. The food looks amazing but the queues are so long you can not be bothered to wait. People are sitting on the road side eating. It doesn't feel very special. ||January 30, 2016
vamckisna||30||Good place to try out different street foods .We had a nice lunch trying different kinds from almost shops.......,,,,,||January 30, 2016
smailfamilyadventure||50||Food was amazing. If you Don't want to walk and eat, the upstairs of the pub serves outstanding food, excellent service and tons of charm in this landmark building overlooking borough market. The chef, Luke, truly has a passion for cooking and it is obvious in the menu.||January 30, 2016
907philt||40||If you like food and coffee then this is a must for any traveller visiting London. I make sure I visit the market every time I'm in London and if you do the same you won't go wrong.||January 30, 2016
MRUNAL P||40||Borough market is worth visiting once...it is one of famous attraction in London...they have lots of verity of food stalls from different countries..so its a feast for foodies..turkish delight is awesome..||January 30, 2016
Dana T||50||If you are into food and love walking around trying lots of different flavors this is the place for you! the market is inspiring, with something new to taste at every corner!||January 28, 2016
Sjjjmm||50||We went to the borough market two years ago and dreamed of returning ! Last week we ran to get there !!! The food was better than we remembered .. It was hard to find the potatoes with the melted cheese but we did ! Check out all the awesome dishes but I would not miss this one. It is in the same booth as the cheese sandwiches. The coconut pancakes are to die for . But you can not go wrong here . Even for the pickiest eater . ||January 28, 2016
MrMrsHill||40||I visited this Market twice in a few weeks - once with my husband and once for work. The food on sale is amazing and when I visited with my hubby we stocked up on the delicious pasta and had an amazing mozzarella and rocket lightly toasted sandwich.When I visited with work it was to see an event at the Market and it was a wine and cheese evening. The cheeses were spectacular and I ended up buying several of them. Also chef Theo Randall was there doing a live cookery demo and whilst this looked amazing I wasnt able to try what he cooked as I dont eat meat and both dishes had meat in them! There was also a chance to see large parmesan cheeses being cut and to try different aged parmesans. Really informative as well as able to try delicious cheeses! A must do if you like food and enjoy visiting markets||January 28, 2016
Eileen R||50||Only a relatively small market but dedicated to great, artisan food. Various cultural fast food stalls in the market (and just outside the market itself) plus artisan bread (delish!), cheeses, fudge...and not a cheap, tatty garment stall in sight - hooray!||January 27, 2016
Matt T||50||One of best Markets I have been shopping at. On 2 weeks vacations, stayed in nearby Borough. place recommended by friends, no matter of weather, with the organic and healthy food. Our favourite spots are now Monmouth Coffee place and Roast restaurant as a crown jewel which we visited on Saturday late night.Looking forward to come back to the market in near future We home now - vacations are over ;(||January 27, 2016
AimeeBell||50||Love the weird and wonderful food here and the great chilled out atmosphere. Went here with my mum on my birthday and we got massive scotch eggs with sweet potatoe fries, strange mixture but worked so well! The food never fails to satisfy!||January 27, 2016
Benamard||50||What a lovely market with a great variety of stands - cheeses, meats, fruit, sea food, cider, chocolate, juices, many other gastronomic treats. Be sure to stop by the balsamic vinegar stand and try the truffle oil balsamic vinegar!||January 27, 2016
Mike D||30||Unfortunately most of the stalls were not open. Some opened at 1p.m. the whole area is a typical market that warrants a good deep clean and reminds me of the night market in Chiang Mai Northern Thailand. Although some of the ingredients were excellent like the variety of olives, fish and cheeses which were unwrapped and added to the natural flavours. Most food can be sampled and go for the venison, paella and chicken in the open cooking area.||January 26, 2016
philiusfogg||50||Foody heaven under the arches.A great tourist destination but equally serving locals. Well worth an hour or two- take cash as many stalls dont take cards||January 26, 2016
himsh||50||Borough market has food stalls and have all type of food...British, European, Chinese, Indian...Very cosmopolitan. Worth visiting.||January 26, 2016
740cristinl||50||Love love love.Cheese, so much cheese. But it's more than cheese. Yummy food abounds here at Borough Market.The first part we wandered around seemed to be food to eat on the spot. I sampled a sausage, but the highlight was the scotch egg with sweet potato fries from a stand called Scotchtails. The second section, under the more permanent structure, seemed to be more cheese and artisan groceries. It all looked fantastic. If we didn't have some plans to meet people for some schnitzel, I would have eaten more here. And cheese. I'll definitely be back.||January 26, 2016
suebD3058ZE||50||Want to buy from local growers/suppliers? Want fresh, delicious food? The Borough Market has hundreds of stalls that offer tastes to suit every palate. Fresh fruit and vegetable, baked goods, fresh juices, cold meats, cooked meat, dairy - so much to choose from and well pricedWe had the most delicious grilled haloumi burger that I still dream about every lunch break!||January 26, 2016
MarinaRyan||50||This is a must visit for anyone coming to London. It is just an unique experience with great quality of foods and spices, local vendors (cheese, breads, juices, meats, honey, you name it). There is also an area only with food, which makes it a great lunch stop option.||January 26, 2016
HayleyGarner1982||40||Visited as part of a team day out when we found ourselves with a bit of time to kill before our evening meal on the south bank.The market was lovely to wonder around, although don't visit when you're hungry, so many delicious smells in the air, and if you are a fan of cheese and olives you will be in heaven.The stalls of fresh fruit and vegetable were good too as were their prices.Will definitely visit again when on a more leisurely trip to London.||January 25, 2016
anthony h||50||I was not keen on this place at first, my daughter wanted to go so off i went. So glad i did, the smells as you approach hit the senses and the mouth starts to water. The first thing i noticed was how clean it was for a market. Then the next thing was the cheese shops. Holy hell people there are some quality cheeses. Monmouth Coffee?? in think it was called was a standout, some of the best coffee i have had in a while, neals yard dairy was awesome as well. In the outdoor market is a stall which does an awesome toasted sandwich, if i could remember its name i would give it a ten star review, apparently some famous food magazine has stated it is the worlds best toast, not sure about that, either way it was damn good. ||January 25, 2016
martin-chambers1942||40||The Borough Market offers the most amazing choice of food - fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese from all over Europe, wine, olive oils and food to eat from stalls. We had a fresh (being cooked while we waited) paella from Spain - delicious!||January 25, 2016
Jill H||50||I love markets and this market has so many options for food everyone should find something to eat, drink and take away! The prices are fantastic, the vendors are generous and go early so the crowds are slim. The crowds on a Saturday afternoon are crazy. Go, eat, love! ||January 25, 2016

We saw this happen a lot when we were there. We would recommend visiting just don't go on a Saturday as it gets incredibly busy.||January 24, 2016
Darren066_11||50||We come to Borough Market a few times a year. The vibe, produce and street food are always good. Would recommend it to anyone visiting the area and they have a midweek and Saturday market which is always popular.||January 24, 2016
Ana Laura G||40||Located just steps from London Bridge, the Borough Market is a good food market with a reasonable variety of cuisines. You can also enjoy a hot sangria... As there are stalls, it is more for eat standing or on the go.||January 24, 2016
David S||50||Borough market is easily reached form London Bridge tube/rail. It is full of stalls selling fresh produce and some with ceramics. You can eat oysters, nibble cheese, have fantastic Spanish Tapas or any other cuisine from around the world Or buy a single farm's cheese. It is what markets should be and it is fascinating to wander round. Don't eat before you go - there is much to tempt and to enjoy.||January 24, 2016
Andyt2120||50||Coming down to London from a small northern town is always an experience. At borough market we found something that cannot be found anywhere near where we live. Extremely busy on a Saturday lunch time but a fantastic mix of stalls selling an exotic Mix of foods and products. So many choices for a quick lunch. It was a brilliant way to spend an hour or so in London and it was free except for the cost of our delicious takeaway lunch.||January 24, 2016
Manc-Holidays||50||This place gets better and better. Full of really good market stalls and an excellent range of produce from all over the world. Wander at your leisure, but be warned, it's busy/||January 24, 2016
HaimDorinPrivado||40||If you want to see an Authentic Market in the heart of London, just go to the Borough one. The main issue here is the fruits, vegetables and principal the food ! Recommended !||January 24, 2016
charlotteq1||40||We came on a Friday and the market wasn't too crowded. It looked and smelled really nice. Food isn't cheap but my friend tried the pulled pork bun, and I had the donut at the "bread and school" stand. Jummy! :)||January 23, 2016
AlvinRaditya||50||Never thought that a market would be this fun! You have this wide arrays of groceries and ready to eat food. All freshly prepared. So it's whether your picking up groceries or stopping by for a meal and snack stocks. Florist, and other things. This place got it all. You won't believe it, but you'll be easily get caught in the market and spend half of your day there.It's also Surprisingly clean for a market. Behind the market there's another interesting spot, the southwark cathedral. Do pay it a visit after a walk in the market, looks even prettier by the twilight sky ||January 23, 2016
Caroline M||30||I suspect you either love or hate Borough Market... It can get extremely crowded at lunchtime, both with people walking round looking at the stalls, and queuing for actual food and drink. The produce generally looks fantastic but can be pricey so it's worth shopping around if you have the energy. I tend to stick to a treat or two that I don't mind splurging on... often chocolate-related...||January 23, 2016
janchan18||40||My only regret with this experience was eating a big breakfast before we went! I was devastated when I realised the extent of the market. I could have spend hours pottering around trying all the different foods available. We probably spent upwards of an hour here anyway. I settled for some pork dumplings and a chai tea, while my partner for a hog roast burger. The food was tasty and reasonably priced. This place is a foodies heaven!||January 23, 2016
stephanieb389||40||Great little spot for a wander round and a bite for eat - lots of variety of cuisine on offer, and lovely fresh produce. Worth a visit, make sure you go around lunchtime (weekdays are best as its a bit quieter) ||January 22, 2016
Phu C||50||Despite claims that this market has become a tourist trap, our local friends insist this is still a local favorite. This remains one of the city's best places for food, and the best among the myriad of choices are the chorizo roll from Brindisa and the duck confit from La Marche du Quartier. Both cost 5 pounds and are located near the main entrance at the intersection of Stoney St and Park St. To get to the market, the nearest metro (tube) station is London Bridge on the black and gray line. If you plan on using public transportation more than twice per day, buy an Oyster Card (not a Visitor Oyster Card) for 5 pounds, then add 6.40 pounds per day since this is the daily cap for unlimited public transit use in Zones 1-2 (these zones encompass almost all tourist sights like Big Ben, Buckingham, Kensington, London Eye, etc). The 5 pound deposit is refundable if you go to a counter at any tube station before returning home (otherwise you'll have to request a refund by mail).||January 22, 2016
Spiralarm||30||Visited on a late Saturday afternoon, first impression it was packed with 20-30 somethings who appeared to be drinking not shopping, not knocking that, but I wanted to get to the food and often had to wade through selfie taking, paper cup holding, alcohol guzzling hordes. When I did get to the food got to say it was all pretty good, particular faves would be meat pipes from the Ginger Pig, really top quality produce, then the Flour Station, good people, good produce, good olive bread and then Chocolicious, big thank you to Hayleigh for supplying me with two nights of wonderful chocolate sampling. Sadly did not get to many other stalls due it being very crowded and simply could not get people to move by being polite, next time we will pick a quieter day or bring a cattle prod. One other thing that maybe a one off, but a couple of places the smell of human urine was a bit much to take.Will certainly give it another go, but maybe on a weekday. ||January 22, 2016
christakis a||50||Very nice.there are lots of things to do.i ate a burger and it was very good.it is a type of fast food and it is perfect||January 22, 2016
barcel0nacitizen||50||The market is not the sort of place where you find only edibles but you can also taste real food well cooked there.Spectacular "fish and chips" we tasted there. The fried hake was perfect!Tradition and market trends togheter in a singular place. Highly recomended!||January 22, 2016
Abigail M||50||This place is awesome - definitely go here. the food is way cheaper than most places in London. We went twice because we loved it so much. The Seafood Paella is seriously good!||January 21, 2016
RobMinPortland||50||I really enjoyed the Borough Market! It has so much to offer. Go to the champagne booth, take a sample, and then buy a bottle to drink (10 pounds plus one pound for two plastic champagne glasses) while you walk the market. I had great food, found amazing balsamic vinegar and white truffle oil as well as other amazing artisanal food items, and loved the energy of the place. It's always so fun when you expect to like a place and end up loving it and the experience. This is a must see/do while in London.||January 20, 2016

Javiera A||50||We went in a large group with a couple of babies. It was a little bit crowded but totally worth it. A wide variety of food for every taste. ||January 20, 2016
Jean O||50||This market is great all different foods to buy really great atmosphere.very friendly and helpfull. Lots of things to try really nice place to visit||January 20, 2016
MrsPope9212||50||I absolutely loved this market. It is very eclectic and vibrant. I loved seeing all the various vendors with their local dishes. I tried veggie dumplings with a hot chili sauce that were amazing. My mom tried a warm cheesey bread stick that she said was delicious. We purchased some other goodies to take home as gifts for people. And finally, I had a vegetarian Egyptian dish that I still dream about! It had rice, macaroni, a spicy tomato sauce and fried onions on top. And mostly everything we saw was reasonably priced. It is a great place for people to expand their culinary horizons. I can't wait to go back!||January 20, 2016
USCKaboom||50||I came here based on friend's recommendation but definitely regret having eaten a few hours earlier. There are so many food options that all looked amazing. Lots of samples to try as well. ||January 20, 2016
MIRJAMSAYS||50||Go here and remember your joie-de-vivre. Foodies eat your heart out, actually : foodies eat. Just eat and smell and enjoy! Great hotdogs, mushroom musthaves, piling pumpkins. Sandwiches galore. Hell yeah! We want more! Go get it, at burough market.||January 20, 2016

It was an enjoyable walk around the market exploring the different kinds of food there, from bread to cheese to truffles to cookies to hot food! Seeing a shop selling seafood, we promptly bought 3 scallops with bacon and vegetables for 6 pounds, which I felt was quite worth it as the scallops were fresh and big. Then we got duck confit burger, which certainly lived up to expectations! (all our friends told us that duck confit is a must-try at Borough Market!) I also went for Boston Sausages, where I got a sausage burger with 2 sausages in it for 4 pounds, which was quite worth it too. We also got cookies and brownies which were amazing. I would say that it was a really enjoyable experience for someone who loves food and wants to try a variety of food. The food is quite worth the money and it is definitely worth a visit.||January 19, 2016
Nora220||30||It is a shame that my first impression of going to Borough Market is not a good one. The place is really, really busy and for me a tad claustrophobic and too jostley... I got separated from my husband a lot because of it.. basically the other people there are too selfish to allow for people who find it difficult to walk to keep together in a crowd. The place was smelly and in a walk-through' area it smelt of urine (probably from the pub crowd in the evenings) but it didn't seem to bother the people were sitting in it and eating... We could not find anywhere selling a simple cup of tea or coffee .. there was smoothies, fruit juice, spiced apple juice, chai and coffee (in very small waxed cups for a lot of money) .. However we did buy chocolates, bread and meat pies, which we took home and they were both very, very good. the pies were from Ginger Pig and we would like to get some more if we go up to London and the same with the chocolate from Chocoliscious, the bread from the Flour Factory was excellent and tbh the produce we bought was excellent and very good value. If there was a little more space to sit and get a coffee and maybe some kind of system to walk around it would improve things... it's not that I don't get it is a market in London.. grew up in London during the 60's and 70's but for someone who has limited mobility due to rheumatism in ankles/knees and hips and so walks slowing and needs a sit down it wasn't easy.||January 19, 2016
Ruben R||40||I am not sure if I can make this review since the day we went, we were not lucky... most the stores were closed. I know... we did not research properly and loose a lot of time going so far. The "food court" was open and quite good. I figure out that when is full open it is an amazing place.Check which day you are going to avoid the same mistake as our.||January 18, 2016
LKR65||40||We went for lunch on a Tuesday just before Christmas and 99% of stalls and restaurants were open. The market itself is really interesting with lots of different foods to taste, purchase or just look at! It had a great vibe. There are plenty of stalls to buy lunch from, of which we happily sampled from 3. The only issue is that there is nowhere to sit or a table to lean on whilst eating.||January 18, 2016
Debsndean2013||50||Really good experience lots of different food to try. We arrived about 3 pm on Friday afternoon and the atmosphere was good. ||January 17, 2016
Dencroft||50||This is a must if visiting London.Saturday's are the best day to go, stalls full of every type of food you can think of from every country!Lots of cooking demonstrations going on, so interesting and the smells are amazing!Easy walk from London Bridge Totally recommend.Nice vibe.||January 17, 2016
twoadults_2kids||50||Great attraction with good quality fresh produce, a large variety of food stalls especially the cheese. Great cooked food stalls as well - we had Ethiopian, freshly made pasta and pies. ||January 17, 2016
mgkmarkr||50||it's vendors upon vendors, food stalls and samples galore. A covered indoor/outdoor bordered by a cobblestone street that will satisfy the most sophisticated palates. Fresh fruits and vegetables abound. More cheese & fish mongers than you've seen in a lifetime, all fresh and willing to delight your tastebuds with samples. And wait, there's more; homemade chocolate & sweets you never seen or tasted.....ever! Then there's the freshly made soups, sandwiches and other European & Asian delights. Oh, I forgot to mention the fresh made coffees, cappuccino, espresso and of course fresh, homemade pastries. A meandering stroll up & down the aisles of this "foodie playground" and you could forget lunch or dinner, "calories be dammed". And to no one's surprise, there are lots more markets like this throughout London.......so enjoy!||January 17, 2016
chrissyM87||40||Always go nearly every weekend . Feels very London all the markets loads of noise and lovely smells of food . I recommend this to anyone even in winter . The fish and chips is amazing I'm not from London and always wanted real fish and ships and found a place . Brilliant ||January 17, 2016
pookala||50||Crowded as all get-out, this would be a tough place to visit with toddlers/large group but wow what a market! If you are serious about eating, cooking, regional food products and ingredients, people watching and visiting a true urban gem - this site must be put on your list.Check website for market times etc. and expect peak crowds during weekend lunch hours||January 17, 2016
LindaPrice||30||We arrived at 11am about one week before Christmas. Very few people dining. Service was very slow. My choice of hot food finally arrived cold on a cold plate. Scrambled egg on toast was in fact cold egg on uncooked toast. On what planet is toast uncooked bread? To be fair they offered a replacement but it had taken so long the first time round that I just wanted to leave. I am a fan of this chain but this was way below standard. I would not go to this branch again. Very disappointing. ||January 17, 2016
cjd_uk||40||This is an on-trend, street food and special food market opposite London Bridge Station, next to Southwark Bridge. If you like walking and eating - this is the place for you.Well worth dropping in on whilst walking along the Thames or going to Tate Modern, London Dungeon, Shakespeare Theatre etc all just 5 minutes away.||January 17, 2016
nna78||40||this is my first time visiting London, went to Borough Market and i looovvee this place. i can find fresh sweet berries and lots of delicious homemade food. i tried deer's burger and it's so yummy... assorted bread with lots of choices, any kind of cheese.||January 16, 2016
JAMCANBUDGET||50||Spent an entire morning at the Borough market and ate/nibbled my way through some outstanding food. Started with the best English muffin I have ever tasted, nibbled samples of cheese, downed 3 fresh oysters with tabasco and lemon then finished off with a steak and kidney pie, mash and gravy .... heavenly. There were other free morsels of cured meats, etc. Then I made purchases to take back to my quarters. Catch the 133 bus from Elephant & Castle to London Bridge then follow the crowds ... this place is a must visit. ||January 16, 2016
MrsBradders||50||A free Saturday always results in a train ride to London Bridge to visit Borough Market.we love the hustle and bustle, the tasters, the smells, the sounds, the people. Enjoyed burgers and pasta for lunch, and brownies and cookies for afters.Highly recommended. ||January 16, 2016
jetCavershamReading||50||Great market with lots of stalls. Really lovely atmosphere. There is so much choice where the food stalls are concerned. Many different nationalities. Great fruit and vegetable, fish and meat stalls too||January 16, 2016
Louie-MaeB||50||I absolutely love this place. Over the years it has seen 1st Dates, family get togethers, friend's parties and general "mooching". There is an atmosphere here that I have yet to feel at any other place in London. The goods you can buy here are of the highest quality and sometimes very random! There is a buzz about the place that makes you want to just re-walk around it again and again. The is a perfect prelude to a evening drinks or dinner along the Thames.||January 16, 2016
gerdada||50||Located few minutes walk from London Bridge, Borough market sell a great variety of cooked food from Europe...they also sell cheese, vegetables, seafood, meat, sausages, ham, salamis.. If you love Oysters, must go Richard Haward for their oysters and Cherry stone clams. Suggesting you go early as some big oysters and clams were sold out. There was a small line up however the wait wasn't too long. We also tried cockles and pan fried giant scallops which were delicious. ||January 16, 2016
VisKat||50||Don't miss it! Its a little food neighbourhood by Thames next to London Bridge.. You can taste any food you can imagine (multicultural food) and drink hot wine or beer.. You can either buy your food and go or have a seat whereever you like.. Have in mind that it closes at about 5 or 6o clock in the evening so its not for dinner!||January 16, 2016
617debbieh||50||This place is buzzing! Crammed with stalls selling fresh produce and confectionery of all kinds. Loads of street food stalls of all kinds to suit every taste bud. All artisan producers. Mulled wine and cider delicious on a cold January day ( presume this changes to something more summery later in the year?). My husband had a hair cut in the barbers (Hobbs) which had been voted in top 3 in Time Out magazine. It was a great haircut! Easy to get to as across the road from London Bridge tube station (unless you come out of the other entrance by the London Dungeon in which case take a left and walk up the road- it is signposted). Not far from the Shard ( you get a good view of it from outside the market).||January 16, 2016
Lou1959Perth||50||A chilly winters day wandering around this amazing market with lots of fab British produce. Yummy eats together with tastings from cheese to meat to gin! A must visit when in London. ||January 15, 2016
Madeleine S||50||You need to go on a Friday or Saturday. It is busier near lunchtime. Food of all types from ordinary fruit and vedge to exotic meats, fish and more. Certainly not cheap but very interesting to walk round. Many stalls with interesting food for lunch. ||January 15, 2016
Chestnutmash||50||Where else can you find drunken cheeses and find out what real truffles smell like? We visited both Spitalfied Market and Covent Gardens and were sorely disappointed - both were just modern shopping malls. Then we found Boroughs market on our last day in London (after their Christmas shut down). Now this is a market! Anything food related, and you'll be able to find here (cheeses, cured meats, breads/bakery, veg, meats), and there were plenty of hot food stalls as well. Very much a must visit if you're interested in food at all!||January 14, 2016
Avis67||50||A feast for the eyes and your belly! We had hard cider from the barrel and walked among all the shops selling cheese, meats, oils, truffles, vegetables and baked goods. Should not me missed.||January 14, 2016
Stephanie P||50||I went to the Borough Market expecting a nice little local thing as one does, whether it be in Bali, Fiji, Sydney or San Francisco, or other spots around the globe but was completely blown away by the quality and kind of market that I found here. My favourite places were JUMI cheese and the blue brain and - truffle looking (no actual truffle involved, just pepper, milk and love) cheese which melts in your mouth like the cheese/pepper version of fairy floss and the next big thing on my steak and pasta.... oops, hang on, can't buy it in Australia. :-(. Apart from all the other great things happening including a venison burger that I usually would not eat (venison in Oz is a bit like Kangaroo - VERY strong), it melted in my mouth. Finally, Richard Haward's RARE COLCHESTER OYSTERS - yep, they are a cut above my home town Sydney Rock Oysters BUT, the other ones (local Rock Oysters?) have nothing on our TASMANIAN NW and St.Helens OYSTERS. All things being equal - this spot is a MUST for any food appreciative person. I am in a perpetual state of wonder as to why this earth of mankind has problems health, obesity, disease and allergies when this tiny spot in inner-city London is a showcase to healthy, tasty and great living. By the way - if you don't drink coffee the lovely staff at Monmouth Coffee recommended Rabat, just at the back of the market and I wasn't disappointed here either. PHOTO TO COME!||January 14, 2016
Jon T||30||Everything is so expensive, and not really worth as well. the food stalls sell tiny portions and the food is not that delicious as well. You go get hispters running independent shops, but thats about it. Makes for great eyecandy and photos.||January 14, 2016
Baronsucio||50||An exciting market with a bustling atmosphere. A mix of tourists and locals with a really great variety of food on offer at the pleasantly staffed stalls.||January 14, 2016
Reynard999||50||A wonderfully cosmopolitan place to visit and soak up the atmosphere. The range of stall from around the world sell a wide variety of foods and drink. We visited early in the morning and it was easy to make our way around. It does get much busier later we were told. Well worth a visit to soak up the ambience.||January 14, 2016
Legallez||50||My friend had never been to Borough Market before so thought this would be a wonderful way to spend a few hours especially when raining as most of it is under cover. You can sample foods from around the world the experience is truly phenomenal. You must try smelling the truffles and the mushrooms are beautiful. Try the hot salt beef sandwiches or Maria's cafe for a traditional breakfast the bubble and squeak is to die for as is the liver. Don't miss this experience it's also close to so many attractions ||January 14, 2016
AilishDavis||50||Borough Market is food heaven. If you only have a couple of days in London it is well worth a stop for lunch. You can get everything here: Egyptian street food, to baklava, to truffle oil to brownies. I have spent many a Saturday morning (despite the crowds) dawdling around this market taking as many free samples as I could get my hands on and eating a load of freshly made food.||January 13, 2016
Bischa||50||As food lovers, this was our favorite attraction in London! We spent hours there, tasting fantastic cheese, amazing baklava, and magnificent sandwich together with a great coffee. Will come again for sure!!||January 13, 2016
878oles||50||Arriving by underground we enheter the marked just before noon on a saturday. Lots of possibilites to tast and experience many differensiert kinds of food. It is also possible to buy newly baked bread, Parma ham, and glasses of sparkling wine. There Are also area with chairs an tables if you want to sit down. Lots of specialitys In the different shops at the marked. ||January 13, 2016
rlemon||40||We had our freshest fish & chips at a vendor who provided just that and nothing more. By the time we had a modest table, the food had cooled enough to eat. Good food, good timing and good price. In addition we bought a roast from a wonderful butcher who trimmed, rolled and tied it properly--an artist at work. The roast was organically grown at their farm and providedthe perfect main dish that evening. The sights, sounds and smells of the market are great fun and the only thing that could have been better was the weather (of course).||January 12, 2016
Moose2016||50||Absolutely amazing collection of food from the world over as well as local fresh produce, including vegetables, cheeses and a host pies and other delicacies. Loads of international dishes and treats, a must for foodies.||January 11, 2016
theharrogatelady||50||Lovely traditional market surrounded by up market food shops and delis. The stalls are bright and colourful and the whole area has a great vibrancy. Lots of stalls doing great street food.||January 11, 2016
OhY56||50||Since my hotel was near by this market, I always stopped by on the way to Tube. Loved the atmosphere and food there. Every dish I tired such as pasta, burger, etc. was tasty and fresh. You should try it, too!||January 11, 2016
Stephen R||50||Don't let the fact that it's a food market scare you away. It's a great place to stroll, sample all types of foods, get lunch from a street vendor, and just enjoy. We sampled many cheeses and even purchased some to bring back to the states. We had a delicious lunch at Pieminister and Khanom Krok, even if we had to stand while eating it. For dessert we shared a brownie from Olivier's Bakery. Made a few other purchases from the various vendors as well. I do think it's important to say that even though it is an outdoor market, it is not a discount market. But that's usually the case when it comes to anything regarding quality. Definitely go there. It's worth the trip.||January 10, 2016
rebecca9196||50||I Could have easily eaten my way around the world. This market had amazing cheeses, paella, oysters, ciders,organic foods and wonderful teas. A shout out to tea for two where i learned so much.||January 10, 2016
Jilly B||50||Well worth a visit to experience the sights, sounds and the smell. Fascinating, colourful and enjoyable soo much to see||January 10, 2016
431SarahE||40||Nestled under the arches is Borough Market. Such a choice of wonderful stalls, from Artisan bread to beautiful fresh fish. There is something for everyone. It's difficult not to try samples of olive oil, cheese, bread, cakes and delicious balsamic vinegar but if you do then you'll never manage lunch, for which there is an abundance of options. And don't forget the warming hot mulled wine or cider. But then you may prefer a beer from the local pubs. Always go on an empty tummy to get the very best this market has to offer. ||January 10, 2016
Gavin W||40||This was an amazing visit, with unexpected gems. Stalls were beautifully presented, from charming French ladies selling delicious preserves, to cheese stalls and meat, vegetables etc. the food to go was excellent, so much so that we went back for a second visit. The place was buzzing!||January 10, 2016
Sodapop12||50||All sorts of cuisine, veg, fruit, drinks, seafood, cheeses, meats, cooked to eat, or fresh to buy. A superb experience. Lovely chutneys with new and exciting flavours, wonderful selection of fresh produce, different types of cheeses and meats, pies,European, Indian, African freshly cooked foods and all mostly undercover, but it is cold so you will have to eat and drink to keep warm. Shame! No loos that we saw and nowhere to sit. ||January 10, 2016
rony s||40||great fund for foodies..wonderful variety and interesting tastes from all over...cheeses, sausages, burgers, fruits and many more...very crowded on weekdays too but more fun..anxiety builds while waiting in line...full satisfaction guaranteed...||January 10, 2016
NurmasFam||50||If you love markets, you will love Borough Market. If you don't, you will still enjoy Borough Market. Plenty to see, plenty of food to eat and many types of drinks. We had a cheese dish consisting of cheese and potatoes from one of the cheese stall and it was delicious!||January 9, 2016
keith l||50||Excellent fresh food, bread, cakes, including gluten free. Cheese, Vegetables, spices, and all types of meat.Fish direct from the boat.Part of the market is dedicated to cooked food, from ostrich burger, to French cuisine, all smells delicious ||January 9, 2016
Kasper N||40||You will find this a reality interesting place to spend a weekend morning and have breakfast. Farmers and distributors sell a wide variety of continental foods, at the highest of qualities. But they cost more in the capital. ||January 9, 2016
TPietscher||40||This market is great, it seems I always missed the right times to visit, but on a Saturday rainy morning I could finally visit it. There are so many options to choose from that it is almost overwhelming. I got which I believe was the best Cookie ever, not to mention a spicy hot cider and a very tasty sandwich. Worth the visit for sure.||January 9, 2016
fabmc||40||Vary nice indoor market with specialties from different countries. Try the fresh Oysters offered at various spots and choose a good wine. Too bad the full-market is not opened everyday, but only wed-sat form 10am to 5pm||January 9, 2016
557ritaf||50||It was an experience....entering the market it begins to smell sooooooo good!!! There were very good food, with a lot of variety (for all tastes) and for a great price (aprox 6-8 pounds)||January 9, 2016

BecMelbs||50||Borough has some wonderful food stalls -- it's lovely wandering around sampling and buying bits and bobs. Worth a stop to put together a picnic.||January 7, 2016
FLgirl74||50||Allow plenty of time for this spot. Good shopping but go to the spots toward the back. It was very crowded on our summer visit. Street performances and lots of eateries too. Good souvenir spot.||January 7, 2016
stevehB3641ZN||50||Time is the only prerequisite for this 'foodies' delight. Both visits have been impressive and still would like to spend more time with the many sights, smells and tastes that these market stalls have to offer including wines, cheeses, olives, truffles et cetera. We ate from the many dishes on offer and enjoyed a coffee while we visited many of the stalls.We must return to do justice to a rich market||January 7, 2016
Ishtiyaq M||50||this place is foodie heaven, they have it all, bakeries, chocolatiers, gourmet coffee, butchers, sea food the list can go on and majority of the produce is amazing. this place never fails to please.||January 7, 2016
Tenorman41||40||We last visited the Borough Market 2 or 3 years ago on a previous visit, and note some changes which however do not detract from it. Many of the food stalls have been collected into a food court on a disused carpark, - a wide variety of wonderful ethnic tastes and smells. The other stalls selling cheeses, meats, vegetables etc remain as good as ever. A must for anyone visiting, as well as locals.||January 7, 2016
hlughod||40||This is the kind of place foodies should not miss. A place to find the best fresh produce, the widest variety of cheeses and cold cuts and a whole lot of yummy local and imported stuff. Make sure you go hungry cause you will definitely be doing a lot of tasting ;)||January 7, 2016
Alison R||50||Smells and sights memorable. The food is out of this world. Veggies I have never even seen before. I purchased a variety of curry spices ready to experiment with. I highly recommend a visit.||January 6, 2016
Laxiaozi08200912||50||Love this market! You can practically find anything that you need here! Reminds me of the Pearl and Silk Markets in Beijing! ||January 6, 2016
Michelle1309||50||My first day in London and went straight to Borough Market. What a great surprise!! Although it was crowded, I loved the place, the food, everything! Had some oysters, pulled beef sandwich and mulled wine, hmmmm! My mouth is watering already, lol!||January 6, 2016
noeliao656||50||When you are away from home and you go to somewhere like borough market you will definitely feel like home again...in our case cheese, wines, honey, empanadas, etc made the perfect time combination with the new, the local, the good vibe around...really a must in london!! Check schedules, we missed it once and had to check open/close times to come back!||January 6, 2016
sueB2498EU||50||Four Aussie foodies visited market to shop for dinner suppliesFantastic Market try the local fish and chips the best I have ever tasted Cheese selections amazing Try pulled pork and sausages Atmosphere great Fun fun easy to get thereWe booked a food tour then went back on our own A must visit in London even if you are not a foodie ||January 6, 2016
exnavynightflier||50||Fabulous open-air market with everything you could want to eat on site or take home. Breads, bakery items, fudge, veggies, wine . . . it's all there in a beautiful setting. Plan on at least 1.5 hours if you like this sort of thing.||January 6, 2016
House_of_Gourmet||50||A trip to London is incomplete without visiting Borough Market near London Bridge. I personally feel this is one of the best markets in London if not Europe. You will find some of the best home grown British produce here. A perfect gift to take back instead of tacky souvenirs. Also around Borough Market there are some great small chops and restaurants. Must stop is Monmouth Coffee for elevenses, one of the best rated coffee in London. Also nearby is the Tate modern Museum which is also fabulous or a trip up the Shard.||January 6, 2016
ChrisandDavid2016||50||Our second visit in just over a year and we weren't disappointed second time around. the food outlets are amazing offering tasty fresh food. The shopping for fresh fruit, vegies and meat is second to none. It is well worth a visit when you are a tourist in London!||January 5, 2016
Samphire67||50||Fantastic place to shop, browse, take photos, eat, drink and soak up atmosphere. If you like cheese, balsamic vinegar, fudge, breads, fish, farmers markets then this is the place to go. You can feed yourself all the way round with tasters or buy a lunch and sit back and watch the world go by. Just be aware there is no Sunday market.||January 5, 2016
Eviltwin62||50||Visited the market twice in the last year and it remains one of my favorite day trips. The food on offer is simply mind blowing and you never have enough space to eat all you want, hence multiple visits required. The best thing about the market is the atmosphere while you shop and eat your way around. A definite visit for any foodie and the like.||January 5, 2016
643sw1||50||The market is close to London Bridge Tube station, and is primarily covered. Ideal on a wet day!The selection of fine foods on display and for sale, is quite unbelievable. Something to suit everybody's taste, whether sweet or saviour.Prices are extremely good, particularly when many items can be found in Harrod's food hall||January 4, 2016
RMZK11||50||Spoiled with choices. You have westerns, asians and eastern cuisines that you can find there. I honestly had trouble choosing which one to try first but ended up trying the grilled cheese first (a must try). A must visit in London. Best time to go is on Saturday where all (if not most) of the stalls are open. If you are thinking of coming here, try not to eat anything before you leave your accomodation as you will not be able to try most of the food.||January 4, 2016
MartinConboy||50||Food to go from all over the world. Brilliant selection of tastes for all palettes. Not many places to sit and eat the food as its more a place to try the London version of street food. Worth a visit.||January 3, 2016
wishwellingtons||50||A great little market that we happened upon by chance. They obit sell food but lots of it and of great quality! Try a few things few lunch or as a snack. Be prepared to push past people. ||January 3, 2016
www877||50||Many modern niche stalls coexist happily with old favourites in this timeless invaluable jewel of Southwark||January 3, 2016
Degrees||40||This is a neat marketplace to stroll through near the River Thames. You can pick up various food products if you are staying somewhere with a kitchen or just pastries for the morning. It is surrounded by pubs and restaurants which are both good and bad. We found Black & Blue to be a good, but expensive steak restaurant with a good wine list.||January 2, 2016
Sarah071181||50||We first discovered this market last Easter when we wandered past on our way to our hotel. So the first thing we did when we went to London for the new year was go straight back. We highly recommend getting a salted beef sandwich. It's excellent value for money & something well worth treating yourself to. Although if there's 2 of you I would suggest you share one as they're very filling. There's such an atmosphere when you're there. A real old fashioned market full of food & smells to excite. None of this bric-a-brac stalls that you find at markets nowadays. ||January 2, 2016
AndreaGambacorta||50||a must see !! multiethnic .we took the fresh fruit and sweets exceptional. the exceptional environment, full of people available.||January 2, 2016
thefastwalker||40||Accidentally wandered into this market and what a great place it is! If only we had found this place earlier as some of it was already closing down in preparation for the New Year Eve celebrations. Would put this on a to do list for next time and would recommend despite not seeing all the market open at the time :(||January 2, 2016
MrsTinckles||50||Pass through at lunchtime and give yourself the opportunity to enjoy streetfood lunch! So much choice, all freshly prepared. There is something for everyone and then some||January 2, 2016
EmmieLouH||50||Went here twice in the same day - first on my own and then with the family to show them what I had found. I could not believe this place! A foodie heaven! Every piece of fruit, every vegetable (more varieties of mushroom than you could shake a stick at) wonderful meat and cheese and street food and mulled wine and fresh fish - yummy freshly shucked oysters! I am salivating! Fabulous!! ||January 1, 2016
Antoinette15||50||I could kick myself for not spending more time for this place, but when you are a tourist on a time-table (even a self imposed one) you gots to keep moving. Just SO many things to explore and eat... and to eat and to take photos of... and to eat.||January 1, 2016
LWF2014||50||This was my first proper visit to the market and plan to return. Absolutely amazing variety of produce and must be seen to be appreciated. Stalls with fantastic displays of many varieties of mushrooms and the truffle stall where you are invited to take the lid off the jars of truffles and soak up one of the most amazing and decadent aromas in the world . To have to choose what to have for lunch is so difficult with freshly cooked foods from around the world and home with the pie stall with more varieties of pies than I have ever seen on one stall. My son-in-law decided on a vegetarian Indian curry while my daughter and I have vegetarian Pad Thai which was my first experience of this pleasing dish and all reasonable priced. I started eating it with chop sticks but even with a fork is was difficult to eat elegantly when you have to stand to do so. I bought a lovely small Christmas tree from the outside florist for £10 which I feel was a bargain and with white cherry lights and gold wire stars and angel on top looks wonderful. Cannot wait until my next visit and local people are so lucky. The massive wreath decorations hanging from the ceiling added to the experience.||January 1, 2016
robmcchlery||40||Night or day this market is busy. It sits next to the London Bridge tube stop. During the day food stalls smell fantastic and offer a very large variety of delicious foods. Fresh meats, cheeses, produce and bread are available. Spice shop is my favorite (can't get enough Vietnam peppercorns!). Expect crowds on the weekend.At night the pubs are busy and spill out into the market.||December 31, 2015
td2traveller||40||You can find interesting things to see and buy. You get interest and entertainment from watching the dynamics of the market. Be prepared for the crowds. Well worth the visit.||December 30, 2015
Marc K||40||Crossing over London Bridge and a few short blocks away is a well-known street market to the locals. Hot food and drinks are in one section and the butcher and cheese stalls are in another area. The lines are long especially around lunch and dinner. My colleague and I grabbed a steaming hot bratwurst at one of the stalls before heading over to the pub one night. The next day I returned and found the roasts to go stall. You had me at beef rib sandwich with horseradish cream. What a crispy, fatty, meaty goodness on a roll example of sandwich perfection. They have other sandwiches, but this seemed to be the sandwich of the day. If I were local I would have picked up some local cheese at one of the stalls. Worth a visit when exploring the other side of the river.||December 30, 2015
terptravels||40||We took a long stroll through the market on a misty day - we sampled everything from truffle oil to bread to cheese and more... Picked up a few take homes and got some really great pics. Don't miss this on your trip to London... The Globe Theatre is close by so do both!||December 30, 2015
Rodrigo W||40||Nice and friendly place, full of people from all around the globe of all ages. There is a huge variety of food in a huge variety of prices, there are available free toilets and some places to sit. Amazing place to visit in London, a must go.||December 30, 2015
RPRBBR||50||Borough Market and environs is great for foodies and all. A cozy neighborhood and a great place to nosh on food from the U.K. and elsewhere during your South Bank walk. This is real food prepared and sold by vendors who clearly love what they do and do everything to sate hungry visitors. Bring your appetite and sample a wide range and samples of delicious.||December 29, 2015
Beverley J||50||Love Borough Market, but it is heaving, just go and pick at all the delicious stalls. You won't want for lunch. Great produce from local Artisans, Good Pubs.||December 29, 2015
Spencer_Voakes||50||My parents visited and told me to visit with my daughter due to the selection of cooked food but also all the other things available there. Getting to Borough Market is easy enough, use the underground and go to London Bridge station; when you exit the tube station they have signs telling you which way to go.Once in to the main part of the market you will see so many different products available; fresh produce - meat, fish, vegetables - made produce - cheese, chocolate, olive oils, wine, fudge etc. There was such a selection of different things you could buy to take home and being just before Christmas there were quite a few places selling tasty mulled wine.In the Green part of the market you have a lot of stalls cooking fresh food; the selection is great - Pad Thai, Indian Vegetable curries, Scotch eggs, salt beef sandwiches etc. The smells were fantastic as were the queues for nearly every seller in the area.My daughter and I had already decided we were having pork sandwiches and we got them from Hobbs but we descended on Khanom Krok for our coconut dessert. A little pricey compared to Thailand, £3.50 for 8 - but they were delicious and got eaten very quickly.We bought a selection of different bits, fudge, some fresh brussel sprouts for Christmas lunch and some cheeses. In all it was a great visit and we will be going back to try some of the other stalls and restaurants in the area. I love the fact that a lot of the sellers have small samples out so you can try their produce before buying it, but it does tempt you to buy far more than you need.If you are foodie, or not, I would suggest a visit to the market just for its business and all the things being sold. We had a great time and will be going back soon.||December 27, 2015
yuls_c||30||This is a must visit to cross out an item on your checklist, but the food was average. Perhaps we should have visited on a weekend where more stalls are open. ||December 27, 2015
DeeRayT||50||My husband is British and used to work in London, whenever we visit we now always try to visit Borough Market. Great selection of local cheese, meats, olives, and lunchy food. Mulled wine, and local beer can also round out a nice lunch. Can get very busy during peak tourist times but still worth a visit, get a selection of treats to take to a local park. Don't miss the Market Porter pub at the back of the Market, across the street - a very old pub serving a large selection of "real ale" on handpump. Best place for great cheese and interesting people watching. ||December 27, 2015
mwooduk||30||Wonderful food market with loads of great choices but nowhere to stand and eat or sit and eat! This is the only reason I am not giving it four stars. Fish! Kitchen was where we got a huge portion of chips but almost impossible to stand and eat there unless you put your chips down in top of a wheelie bin! Lots of Pubs around plus close to the Shard and Southwark cathedral - London Bridge tube station. Bring cash - not all the stall owners took credit cards although fish! Kitchen did :-)||December 27, 2015
Adam H||50||This market is a must see for anyone visiting or living in London. The stalls, fresh food, cheeses, charcuterie, cakes, breads, chocolate....so much stuff, the people that work there are always friendly and you can just wander through and taste some freebies. The freshly cooked lunch and meals bit is great, that paella and curries from the fishmongers is amazing. There are a couple of pubs the line market and the walk up or down from either London Bridge or Waterloo is one of the nicest areas to walk through in London, from an old school history perspective anyway. ||December 26, 2015
Lordflashman||40||Borough Market is London's oldest food market....It has won this accolade through selling produce of the utmost quality and provenance, moving with the times and generally being able to interpret what its customers want.....Herein lies the crux, many of its customers have money to spend, are food snobs, and think of nothing if paying £5 for a sausage roll or Scotch egg; and consider such a cheap eat! So if going to Borough Market, do be prepared to pay premium prices....Afterall, the place is continuously name-checked and championed by style magazines, top chefs and Guardianista types.. And hipsters-yuck!On my recent visit, I was overwhelmed by the varied cuisines on offer, the delightful smells and presention of the food as well as the magical ambience! It is worth noting that top-notch non-food establishments also exist within the market area (Hobbs barbers) and on the periphery of the market (The Wheatsheaf and Market Porter).....A visit is bound to cheer you up no end, even if window shopping...||December 25, 2015
Mark M||50||We went to Borough Market one Saturday and had a great time. What's good about it? It's really popular and there's a real buzz to the place. Also a good place to head for during the week - nice pubs like the Market Porter and the Anchor are nearby, as well as a famous ship (the Golden Hind?) and the Globe Theatre. Also Vinopolis and numerous decent restaurants.The downside? So many people around, it's sometimes hard to get through the crowds! Lots of interesting stalls selling all manner of food: meats of all sorts, cheese, tea, ready-copked curries etc, vegetables, fruit, wine. You name it, it's there.To really do it justice, you need to set aside at least four hours. None of it is truly indoors, so dress appropriately and bear in mind that you could get wet if it rains.||December 25, 2015
AndrewDNZ||40||We stopped in to the markets on Christmas Eve. It was quite busy but still well worth the visit. A great aray of food from different cultures. We had Egyptian followed by a brownie. Cheers!||December 24, 2015
GwendaNL||50||Omg this is paradice for anyone who loves food. The style, type of foods, quality of food are all good. I would go here each day if I would live here. Really something you just have to experience.||December 24, 2015
goodguyjas||40||If you love your food and love a great atmosphere of a busy market then this place is worth a visit. So many tempting foods and good place for a lunch or filling snacks. Also great for cakes and pastries. Went to the cheese shop which has quite selection. Near some good pubs too.||December 24, 2015
chhand_bhatakanti||40||its a big over priced market of vegetables, fruits, cheese, varieties of meat and what not. It has many food stalls of different countries run by the people of their respected countries. Some of the food stalls are really good.||December 24, 2015
irwin1985||40||Nice place to walk around and eat. Very affordable and unique items available.They close around 5pm ( starting to ).Very clean||December 23, 2015
Louise N||50||Known as the place for "foodies", but even we amateurs can have a great time in this festive market. Pleasantly noisy with enthusiastic shoppers. Bought truffle olive oils as gifts to bring home to Chicago, but the possibilities are endless if you had room in your suitcase. Other nearby landmarks besides this historical market make it a very worthwhile destination any time of year.||December 23, 2015
Melomoiselle||50||Visited borough market just today and my friends and I loved it! there were varieties of food, seafood were fresh ! Lot of choices for Pastries and fruit juices. it was bustling when we dropped by on a Wednesday afternoon at 2pm z||December 23, 2015
mario g||50||If browsing thru food stalls , looking at weird vegetables , smelling new spices , nibbling smelly cheeses , sampling tasty bits and bites is your thing - don't miss this !||December 23, 2015
oscarpetispas||50||This is a great market to wander around. Local produce is being sold here. Not the cheapest place to buy, but what a great assortment of vegtables, cheeses, cider, honey, fresh vegetarianfood, cookies and lots more. All in a great old market environment. Well worth a visit!||December 23, 2015
Thais I||50||I could go there over and over again. I just love going there, trying different foods, buying spices and sweets, eating my favourite paella with my friends...||December 22, 2015
Bri B||50||There is everything you could ever want at this market from fruit to fish, from juice to flowers. Great prices. We had Raclette (long queue but worth it). We visited on a weekday, so it was less busy, but still crazy busy. Absolutely have to go here!!!||December 22, 2015
02040508BW||50||I recommend visiting on an empty stomach. There is so much cheese , oils, chutneys, jams, meats, sweets to try you will leave waddling.It also a great place to visit if you are a keen amateur photographer with different colours and textures. ||December 22, 2015
Ms_Need_A_Vacation||40||I love the range of products you could find in Borough Market. It is such a great place for a foodie like myself to view, to taste and to buy. Do go early (before 11 am) on a weekend to avoid the crowds. Take in the sights, smells and the taste of the market. Have a coffee and breakfast. There are still many products you can bring home with you.||December 21, 2015
murrayathome||50||If your visiting London then you really must visit Borough market. It's not cheap but it's excellent quality and a visual and tasting feast. ||December 21, 2015
582christenet||50||Great stop for lunch or dinner. I shop here for fresh veg, fruit, meats and cheese. Stop by Bread Ahead for some of the best donuts ever! Don't forget to stop in shops around the market. This place is a foodies dream come true!||December 21, 2015
Anngie22||50||We walked through here for a few hours on a Saturday morning and even though it was rainy, we still had a blast. I definitely recommend going hungry. Great sandwiches, but also fun taste testing for anything from cheese to wine to meat to fruit to olive oil... you get the picture. Lots of fun pubs in the local area as well. Great to pair with a walk along the south bank of the Thames. ||December 21, 2015
alwayspositiveJJ||50||Always enjoy a browse around this area on the South Bank. A wide variety of 'street food' is available. There is a great barber too which I have used seversl times. Some good pubs close by and as it situated under the elvated trainlines it has an 'edgy' feel to it. As I say, a great attraction, free except for the food and beverage you choose to consume. For overseas visitors or Brits this is a great area. ||December 21, 2015
hannahd806||50||Just go there. That's all I can say. It's amazing. So much choice. From food you can eat there, to fresh product you can take away. Mhmm!||December 21, 2015
donbon85||50||I love Borough Market, always visit when I am peckish so I have an excuse to over indulge while there. Such a brilliant atmosphere too. Will always try and visit every time I am in London. Very easy to get too - I always get the tube to Waterloo and have a nice stroll along the Thames towards London Bridge.||December 21, 2015
levelhead2004||50||when i was a grass hopper i used to go to borough market with me brother to buy fruit and veg for his shops now the place has been transformed to a retail market with restruants and bars not like the old days when i used to be there at 5am and run around to collect the produce and load it on the lorry..............went there a few weeks ago the place is really nice to take your family for a day out||December 21, 2015
PoorLittleGarf||40||Went there yesterday, was great to feel the atmosphere of this old tradition. Lovely food & drink to choose from, not all at low prices but then you expect to pay higher, not that I feel it's right to do so. But nevertheless it is well worth a visit.||December 20, 2015
chaperon-rose||50||We spend several hours in the market, drinking and eating. Really cozy. One of my favourite spot in London.||December 20, 2015
shamonac2018||40||Yes, we know Borough market is a must visit for all foodies. You get everything from kangaroo burgers to deer hotdogs! Brave the mad hungry crowds and relentless rain (it is a semi outdoors market) and discover hidden gems!||December 20, 2015
Tony C||50||what an amazing busy market, so much food to choose from, the aroma of the different foods,very busy on a saturday was packed could hardly move, friendly traders great atmosphere could spend a fortune here wait i did lol , wish had something like this in norfolk||December 20, 2015
Boyzdungood||50||What a fabulous place to visit even on a Saturday the only thing to remember is it will be "busy " well it was the last Saturday before Christmas. All that aside there was more food than you can shake a stick at forget all those Southbank Xmas food stalls this is where it's at!!Ps it's great any time of year.||December 20, 2015
ScreenSaverWoking||40||We had a great Sunday afternoon trying different cheeses, sausages and other culinary delights. We bought a few treats and had a few drinks too.You can haggle with the vendors (a little) but the best thinks is trying new foods and tastes. Feel free to ask the stall holders if there's something you'd like to try they always be happy to help.||December 20, 2015
X3316RWmichaelf||50||It was so nice they have so much stuff to eat and some of the market stalls let you try food you should definately go here you wont regret it||December 20, 2015
Tuffino||40||This is a foodie heaven, lots of variety with some excellent produce on sale. You will always find something that you just can't live without! ||December 20, 2015
Lawrencebaker||50||Well worth a visit, we had Tapas which was very nice, but the vibe of the place was great. There is so much variety, the stalls sold artisan style products, which are tricky to source, like wild boar, or venison, cheeses etc. Then there is pretty much every cuisine you thought of. A london must.||December 19, 2015
WoodyEssex_UK||50||Never knew this was here & how great it was! The different food & drinks is amazing. Especially loving the cheese stalls & couldn't resist the melted cheese sandwiches or duck wrap along with a hot cider or mulled wine. If I lived closer, this would be my local supermarket & I would have constant visits to slimmers world. Great with Christmas decs as well.||December 19, 2015
Tampagirl1956||30||Finally got to visit borough market. I made the mistake of going on a Saturday, it was the only day i could fit it in to be honest. Yes there is a great variety of food if you can get to it. It was absolutely jam packed. There were so many people you could not get to the stalls. If you really want to try a week day.||December 19, 2015
Debbie O||50||In London at Christmas time and we decided to visit the Borough market as it was recommended to us by locals. Well worth the effort because although it was very busy..the atmosphere, the people and the shops were worth it.There were many different types of stalls..gluten- free and vegan options included.Our favourite stall was a cheese one that had fabulous blue vein and brie cheese from France.All around us were people buying different foods to eat or to take back home to cook later. During the week it is less busy but despite the crowds well worth the visit anytime of the week.||December 19, 2015
Michael E||50||many shops and stalls selling foods from all over the world. Right opposite London Bridge station. You will not go home hungry with many free samples. Although open most week days and Saturday the best day is Friday. The best place in London to buy food.||December 19, 2015
PierreR1200GS||50||Lots to choose from everything you would desire for a nice snack lunchanything you desire didn't stop at a local bar grab yourself a beer dinner or just wonder around and see people shop. Stop at a local bar and grab yourself a career or hotline perfect afternoon||December 19, 2015
418claren||50||Such a variety of stalls around Borough Market. Even though I didn't intend to buy anything many stalls offered small samples which were great to try and were all lovely with no pressure of final purchase.I did end up buying some sea salted fudge which was delicious, and it's great to support some local businesses that create such great and unique products.||December 18, 2015
Aman C||40||You can spend hours in borough market enjoying the food stalls. Lots of gluten free options eg cakes and street food! Would recommend on a Saturday afternoon! ||December 18, 2015
Dazzafromrussia||50||Borough market was the very first market I visited when I arrived in London and it has become my favourite. There is always great food to try and fresh produce to purchase. There are plenty of bar or restaurants to visit either for lunch or dinner. I love wondering through on a weekday afternoon (best time to visit). It's a great place to people watch or purchase high end, excellent quality produce. I particularly love the fresh fruit and veg stands, pasta stand and the exotic meat guys, if you are craving a little kangaroo steak, it's a go to. ||December 18, 2015
Jellygo||50||Never been here before. Very very busy on a Saturday afternoon but worth it.It's a great place. You can get all types of cuisine from the stalls and sampled some before going over to The Anchor.||December 18, 2015
Vickyw789||50||Wonderful place to visit lots of different foods to sample very busy and not far from the golden hind||December 18, 2015
Shalab_Agra||50||Had heard about Borough market as we were in London, we decided to visit. It's a very lively and busy place. It has ROAD side shops, fruit, fish, vegetables for sale. Delicatessen goods of which you could sample. The various salamis, cheeses and olives, which we sampled were excellent. There are food stall too which offer a wide range of delicious meals. I had bratwurst and sauerkraut, which was tasty. The artisan breads were excellent too. Well worth a visit.||December 18, 2015
miken898||40||It's a fantastic place to eat at. I went with my girlfriend who works in the area for lunch, and it was evident that it's a favourite place for locals in suits grabbing a bite to eat and for tourists stopping in for some street grub. Shopkeepers are all friendly. There's something for everyone - vegans, meat lovers, a shop for cheese, another for beers of the world. ||December 17, 2015
FlysAroundtheWorld||50||I'm very partial to places like the Borough Market and was thrilled to stop in with my husband. We enjoyed some samples and made purchases, there was so much to try and more to see. Skip lunch and make a nosh of it! We will be back when in London again.||December 17, 2015
191dannyd||50||Been there in the afternoon, December. It only operates Thursday to Saturday. Great food market with unique food stands and shops. Great oysters place, cheese shops, hot and spicy cider etc. A must while in London!||December 17, 2015
Londoner1710||50||I have lived all my life in London but only been twice at this market and it is incredible. There is so much choice and everything you take is divine and not overpriced. Unfortunately it is far from my home but if it wasn't i would go every week! Definitely try the raclette with potatoes and the pork belly sandwich!! ||December 17, 2015
615danielled||50||Great experiences, the choices and variety of this place is fantastic, from the moment you enter the Market you get the smell of fish, cheese, truffles, cooked meats and lots more. All the street food is great and would strongly recommend a visit||December 17, 2015
FurryFroggy||50||This market exceeded my expectations. The only disappointing part was that I couldn't eat everything and I went on my own, so I couldn't share / try a lot of different foods / snacks with other people. If I lived in London, I would just come back until I tried everything. Went on a Friday during lunch time - lots of people, but great fun. You can get a good lunch here for around 5 pounds (which I think is less than McDonalds in London...crazy). There's a free restroom (just one toilet each for males and females) and some benches to sit (if you're lucky to find a spot) in a covered area...sometimes this is all you're looking for after sightseeing in London for a week.||December 17, 2015
iann691||50||Paid a quick visit here during a recent visit to London and really enjoyed the market and surrounding areas.. If you are a foodie this place is a must. ||December 17, 2015
Ally_P22||50||I loved going to the Borough market. I love markets in general, but this one is especially lovely. The area is neat - cobblestone streets, busy restaurants, etc. There are plenty of prepared food stalls, fresh food, and a few souvenir/gift stalls (eg. award winning olive oil). Go during lunch (I believe it shuts down by 5). There are many stalls - Pieminister is great if you want to try traditional pies in London!||December 16, 2015
Marilyn H||40||I simple love markets. They have loads of variety. Get the train to london bridge underground station and walk down. Try camden market too if you like market food!||December 16, 2015
Lampard1966||50||I had heard of this place, but it was not a priority. I was on the bus passing by the Market. When several people stood up to get off, and then I noticed the smell, or should I say smells...thought screw it...Nothing ventured....nothing gained. Within minutes I was literally drooling (yes drooling and grinning) by the Pad Thai stall. Blown away by all kinds of cooking, got a mulled wine and wandered. Had a steak and "sydney" pie from pieminister. It was delicious! There were burgers and paella and cheese and sausages and I obviously knew nothing about this place but it's obviously the place for lunch! Don't read my ramblings just go!!!||December 16, 2015
andydC8824DI||50||Work not too far from borough market and whether it is a lunchtime stroll through the different stalls or visiting one of the many pubs or restaurants time spent at borough market is never time wasted. Always a visit to Neil's Yard cheeseburgers never fails to delight.||December 16, 2015
DerbyGrandad||40||On the south bank near London Bridge station so it easy to get to but its not your usual tourist market. For a start it housed under the railway arched with glazed Victorian roofing to fill the gaps and huge cast iron columns and bridge supports. It was probably a genuine food and veg market in the past and there is a till a lot of fresh and exotic food on sale. There are also lots of home made food products and hot food stalls selling all manner of British and foreign dished, and all mad keen to give you taste. it's also busy and noisy with the odd train rumbling overhead. It's an amazing sensory experience.If the market is not enough to interest you, next door is Southwark cathedral, an oasis of calm, and other tourist attractions on the river frontage. I recommend ending you visit with a walk over the Millennium bridge for a good view of the river.||December 16, 2015
bobbyanna||50||Yes, it seems that everything you could ever think of in the world relating to food can be had at Borough Market. On the weekend it's especially crowded but well work a visit. You won't leave hungry. This is a combination Farmer's market and food court, but that doesn't begin to describe it. Be prepared to stay a while. It's worth every minute! I was impressed wit h the quality of the feed offerings and with how knowledgeable each vendor was about their speciality including detailed cooking instructions, or which wines to use with which cheeses. This is a wonderful, not to be missed experience.||December 16, 2015
traveltheworld449||40||This place has a good vibe to it and there is a very good selection of food and drink here. The cost of things here can be very expensive though but if you have the money and want to enjoy yourself why not. Just as a general tip there is also a small pub called the rake here which is good as well. So if you fancy trying some beers from all over the world then you can. But that is expensive also. Enjoy.||December 16, 2015
libraschild||50||I've divided my observations into pros, cons and tips to enjoy the market.The reasons the market is great:- The vendors as generally very friendly and enthusiastic about their products and you can feast on so many samples of great ingredients, you may not have space for food- It is a great place to pick up gifts for any foodies in your life, produce and products are often British or otherwise 'artisan' or rare- Great seasonal offerings to enjoy on the day, like mulled wine or hot cider in the winter, fresh fruit juices in the summer- Probably an amateur photographers dream - visions of rabbit and fowl with fur and feathers still on them hang from one stall, a bounty of mushrooms at another, a rainbow of fruit at another- Long history as a food marketThe reasons I am sometimes dubious:- You get what you pay for. This is not a bargain farmers market. It has a lot of very specialist items and the fresh produce has become pricey to match the rental price and location. Foreigners on a weak currency may find it pricey - Brits from outside London will find it pricey - Londoners often find it pricey. You could be paying about the same for a burger as if you sat down somewhere while now you have collected a burger from a stall and are hovering in the cold, standing to eat it- If you go in the weekend, it is VERY crowded, VERY. If you go midweek, it is a lot better but the atmosphere is not as good- It has become increasingly commercial- Not a good place for a quiet chat and catch up due to the fact you will spend a lot of time walking behind each other- If you don't have access to a kitchen, unfortunately you will see a lot of produce you want to buy but can't cook or eatTips:- The market is liveliest on a Saturday. But if you brave Saturday, do so by 9am at the latest which will give you about 2 hours before it gets really crowded and the people with prams who want their kids to stare at other people's bums while running over your toes turn up. Otherwise just go in the week, slightly less vendors but slightly less people too. Note: this is a Saturday market, not a Sunday one - Keep your bag close to your body and closed, it is crowded at any time so a pick pocket dream- If you go as friends, try get the vendors to cut sandwiches etc for you so you can share, try as many things as possible. Personal recommendation would be the chorizo and pepper rolls, the bacon and scallops, the brownies from the Flour Factory and the grilled cheese sandwiches- Do a quick tour before picking what you want to eat or you may regret not having the stomach space or the budget to get what you really wanted but saw too late- Get what a stall seems to specialise in, the best items are by stalls that do only a few things. I once got a very overpriced (over double what I usually pay) pastei de nata from a bakery stall and it was phenomenally disappointing but they had too many elements to do everything well- There are some good bars and restaurants in the area in general. If it is a nice day, it's great to do the river walk from Borough Market, stopping at the Tate Modern, the Globe theatre and the National Theatre (which often has outdoor events in the summer for free), possibly picnicking off what you bought at the market to Waterloo- Dress warm in the winter, it's sheltered from rain but still exposed- Not really suitable for prams or wheelchairs - not so much because you can't navigate but you have limited space to do so- At the risk of sounding obvious, draw some cash from an ATM (there are loads) nearby or come with some ready cash before shopping - not all stall holders will take card!||December 16, 2015
Michelle M||40||If you're not from the country then be prepared for traditional English foods on sale. I'm pretty picky myself but it was nice to just walk around. Great atmosphere.||December 15, 2015
Dave D||50||I have never been let down at Borough Market.It always makes me smile all the time I am there.Quality food sold by helpful people. Don't go to this market if you have already eaten!Enjoy as much of the food as you can. I do! Once you have been here, you will always want to go back.Final question "Would I return?"Of course. I always try and fit a trip in every time I'm in London now||December 15, 2015
Michelle E||20||First impressions were good, great location, fab views of the market place until we were shown to our table. Initially we had to endure the very noisy leftover lunchtime Christmas party goers, but as it was the season to be jolly we excepted this in good spirit until it became a battle of song between a table of males v's females, chanting names and attempting carols !! We were seated very near to the air conditioning unit, which was blowing out streams of cold air. We asked on several occasions for it to be turned off as it was extremely cold, we also pointed to another guest on the other table who ate her entire meal with her coat on, she was clearly feeling it too !! It was not attend too. I asked for the cocktail menu, I was given one between 4, we asked the waiter if her could recommend any long or virgin cocktail's and he just looked at us with a blank expression. He clearly had no idea about the drinks. I then asked him about the items on the main menu, his knowledge was extremely limited, I also asked for the vegetarian menu, which did not appear for,some 15 minutes and then that was after several reminders. We ordered our wine which promptly arrived and was poured but we were not asked to try first. Our starters arrived, I order Stilton with beetroot, I know it is called fine dining but my plate seemed to be missing both Stilton and beetroot, however I had plenty of green leaves with a delicious dressing. Our mains arrived, but no vegetables or side dishes and at no stage were we asked to order any, and as this was our first visit I presumed they would arrive with something other than four slices of beef and a Yorkshire pudding! My overall experience was extremely disappointing, I felt the staff had very limited knowledge of the menu and overall contents. Their English language and understanding was very sparse. Sadly a very disappointing experience, extremely expensive and one we sadly will not be repeating.||December 15, 2015
LuccaQ||40||I was happy that my hotel was near this wonderful market. Visited each day of the three I spent in London. Was amazed by the banner hanging from the ceiling that said, Celebrating 1000 years of Borough Market in this location. Is a must if you are in the London Bridge area.||December 15, 2015
Russell k||50||A great place to visit with loads of stalls offering different foods, drinks and eateries. A lot of history surrounds this place and the atmosphere is electric. Can take in the Shard as close buy.||December 15, 2015
PhoebeGreeen||40||The market is full of life, of colors and flavors: a feast to the eyes, nose and taste buds! All kind of finger-foods (burgers, sausages, wraps, sandwiches), cooked foods, delis (cheese, salamis, honeys, chutneys, exotic meats- ostrich or crocodile salamis), homemade breads, beautifully arranged vegetables, fresh fruits and made on the spot juices. Even if you don't need to buy anything specifically, it's a pleasure to spend some time in the area, tasting samples or asking vendors about their products. Useless to say that I advise you to visit the market on empty stomach, so you can taste this, and that, and that, and that too!||December 15, 2015
Persillerod||50||We went there on friday at midday and it was very busy. Despite of this we had an amazing time walking around the market! We spend a few hours there and got to taste and buy a lot of wonderful food and drinks of all kinds. There is everything there, and all we tasted was delicious. I can recommend to buy plates to share, to save space to taste more stuff.||December 15, 2015
Karen S||40||Went to market on sat,what a interesting place,different food,eating places,wines,ciders,sample before you buy.will go again.||December 15, 2015
John H||50||Love the market, great vibe and great variety and the market food is to die for. Especially go and have all the free tasters you can and then fill your mouth with the pork sandwiches on offer. Hands down best pig in town!!||December 15, 2015
Moni558||50||If you like food then you can't miss Borough market. Everything you could possibly want you will find. You could spend an entire day there and not eat everything, and leave wanting more. A fun atmosphere with unique goods and eclectic tastes. Every cheese you could want, smoked meats, pastries, and every kind of street food you could ask for. Trust me if you can only go to one market and you like food, this is the place! ||December 15, 2015
RAP6||40||We met friends at Waterloo and headed across to Borough Market.Busy, buzzing, fabulous.Great produce.Oyster, prawns and prosecco pre-lunch.They now let dogs in (we left ours at home) but it is too busy and, after all, it is a food market.||December 15, 2015
picture_of_innocence||50||Great market, good selection of fresh goods, perhaps a couple more cheese shops than I would have liked but each to their own.||December 15, 2015
Simon T||50||I really miss the variety of the old food markets and Borough Market really delivers with lots of choice. If you like Duck eggs or even Quail eggs this is the place, all types of mushrooms and a great French wine merchants!||December 14, 2015
TamzUK||50||So we rocked up on a Saturday morning, had a beer in the pub and perused the market stalls and tasted the wares! Absolutely lovely and deceptive bigger than you think. A great way to start the day for 'brunch' and then head off into London to see the sights!||December 14, 2015
Andrew W||50||Always loved this place. Straight out of London Bridge tube station, 1 min walk.Not the best place to go when you're hungry as there is so much to choose from from all over the world. Actually its not a good place to go when you turn up and have just eaten too as you are missing out on all this wonderfully looking food and drink. Very busy and lots to see. Was a bit surprised in the lack of Christmas stalls. Great looking cheese, bread, butchers etc||December 14, 2015
cazbatt||50||This market is awesome - a food lovers dream! You can but absolutely any food here and it's really good. There are stalls selling a whole host of delicious ingredients plus a very wide range of cooked food to eat there and then. Lots of the stalks have tasters and the stall holders can tell you lots about what they are selling. I came away with truffle sauce from Croatia and the most divine mushroom pate - but I could quite easily have bought much more! ||December 13, 2015
emma1913||50||If you love food markets, be sure to put this top notch market on your schedule. Spent hours there and had a great time.||December 13, 2015
519arthura||50||Been here many times....great butchers, fish and lot of hot food options when you get hungry. A 'must visit' for any foodies or just those who like cooking with high quality fresh and unusual ingredients||December 13, 2015
jane l||40||Visited the market last Saturday and although very busy there was so much lovely food that you didn't mind because round each corner was another stall selling something else! There were 4 of us and we got 2 of burgers etc and shared them so we had enough room to try different foods! ||December 13, 2015
Par S||50||Lunch time? Skip the shopping street restaurant and go to the market! Taste and buy bits and pieces from the variety of outlets. ||December 12, 2015
Hamxa321||40||The whole market is full of cheap and expensive stalls of every part of life. It is usually crowded.||December 12, 2015
claudiacV2345LD||50||Very good market where you can buy something for your snack when you walking around. There is a great atmosphere. I really reccomend this while you visiting London||December 12, 2015
dafona||50||Visited on a Friday,always busy .Fantastic array of stalls and sellers.Top quality fruit/veg(mostly organic or free range),Meat ,Spices and Herbs,WInes,Cider,Oils etc Everything well laid out and presented.Products not cheap but many unusual foods to buy,great for that special occasion.||December 11, 2015
Orcaorca||40||It is quite honestly possible to get almost any type of food you may desire here, and in a traditional setting of one of london so oldest market areasThis is enhanced by the variety of pubs, wine bars, and restaurants which totally surround the market properHighlights include the salt beef sandwiches and a small sausage grill outlet in the railway arches, so a sandwich and a glass of local beer from the Wheatsheaf pub next door works pretty wellBut just the ambience of the place is worth the visit ||December 11, 2015
mikek794||40||Mecca for foodies with offerings from around the world. Offerings are artisanal and reasonably priced. We settled on brilliant pot pies, Turkish coffee and Baklava. Could be a little cheerier.||December 11, 2015
joyful93||50||I love going to Borough Market - usually during the week before the crowds. So much good, fresh food to either eat as you walk around, or bring home to enjoy! Each time I go I discover something new! If you are visiting London for the first time, Borough is a must! And if you live here like I do, I visit Borough weekly!||December 11, 2015
SevenoaksSinjun||40||Close to London Bridge rail station, the River Thames embankment path and the Shard Tower, this is a very popular semi covered market full of stalls selling mainly artisan foods. All sorts of nice stuff for sale - hams, spices, fish, lots of cheese stalls etc. There are also stalls selling food to ready to eat that you can take away and enjoy while perhaps sitting in the adjacent Cathedral grounds. There are also a couple of nice pubs there too. Very good.||December 10, 2015
JoieAV||50||It's a community of artisan food vendors that offer unique & delicious food. Super busy during lunch times. Take note of the market hours as the shops have irregular schedules. Flat Cap Coffee Co is a coffee cart in the heart of the market serves very smooth coffee that's better than Monmouth. I recommend venison burger from Furness Gourmet Grill and cheese from Bath Soft Cheese Co.||December 10, 2015
Woodie0||40||Had heard about Borough market as we were in London, we decided to visit. It's a very lively and busy place. It has fruit, fish, vegetables for sale. Delicatessen goods of which you could sample. The various salamis, cheeses and olives, which we sampled were excellent. There are food stall too which offer a wide range of delicious meals. I had bratwurst and sauerkraut, which was tasty. The artisan breads were excellent too. Well worth a visit.||December 10, 2015
Taxidevil||50||I love visiting Borough Market when I am in London as it is full of hustle and bustle. Lots of different food to try.I stopped by my favourite chocolate stall and bought mis-shapes for 31.50 a bag. A bargain!||December 10, 2015
ToTheWanderers||50||Borough Markets are a must for all visits to London. The food options are amazing. Lots of delicious samples and the vendors are more than happy to chat about their food||December 10, 2015
kwchuchu||50||Walking to there from other attractions. Buy many delicious food with cheaper price. The atmosphere is great||December 10, 2015
John R||50||A foodies delight, buy or eat there it's one of Londons best sights. Combind with a walk along the South Bank to soak up 1000 years of history.||December 10, 2015
Margot M||50||I have been to Borough Market so often but still always find it to be a fascinating place. In the summer you can sit in the yard of the cathedral and eat your food/drink your coffee and in the winter you can sit in the glass extension. The selection of types of food is just great, something for everyone: Tasty Asian, Afro/Car./ European food, something for Vegetarians, the list is vast. There is a nice pub right in the centre of the market and you can sit under cover to have your drink. The atmosphere is great and buzzing. Combine this with a visit to the nearby Shard for an interesting morning/afternoon London trip. Yes, it gets busy but that has never deterred me from returning over and over again.||December 10, 2015
gulzeynepgenc||50||This is far away the best and utmost food market that I have ever been!Amazing variaties from all over the world in an atmosphere where you can lose yourself easily.Try to go there with some friends in order to many different types of food and taste all!You can even go there and buy some stuff for your home- like fresh pasta, olive oil, cheese, ham...Definitely one of the top to-do's in London!Have fun and bon appetit!||December 10, 2015
Вера В||40||A very nice place to visit, if you are a London tourist. But definitely only once. It's overcrowded. People sell there very tasty food, but it's impossible to move around or even eat an ordered meal.||December 9, 2015
Drew1962_10||50||An absolute must see if you are at all into food. We saw it on a well known TV cook's show but they must have cleared it for her as it was packed when we were there. Huge variety of stalls selling premium fruit and veg, game, butchermeat, fowl fish and cheeses plus spices and herbs. There are also stalls selling paella curries and other street food to go and lots were. Worth a trip. There are also lots of neighbouring pubs and restaurants for lunch||December 8, 2015
P m||50||Great atmosphere and plenty of food stalls so spoiled for choice. I had a chicken combo from the Ethiopian stall and it was amazing. They had something for everyone and plenty to see. Close to the globe theater too.||December 8, 2015
118lucyh||50||Wonderful Market. Foodie Heaven. One stall after another mainly at one end of the market. But what a big end. All sorts of different cuisines on offer from Pizza to Paella. Stir Fry to German Frankfurters. The problem was where to begin. You can literally eat your way around the world in one day if you are REALLY hungry.At the other end of the market are lovely clothes stalls and leather, jewellery and anything else you woukd normally expect in a market.Very very busy and buzzy! LOVE it and we will and are going again.||December 8, 2015
Cruvinel A||40||Heaps of fresh fruit and vegetables, platters of seafood, huge speciality cheese wheels, crisp organic breads and just about anything else a food obsessive could be tempted by is available at this ancient and enduringly popular market. The ingredients are of the highest quality, but also often with prices to match, so if you're looking for an affordable meal it's best to join the queues for one of the burrito, burger, hog roast, falafel, raclette or other hot and delicious lunch stalls.The market gets so full as to be no fun at all on Saturday lunchtimes. Go on a Friday or get there early so you can actually get near the food, rather than be pushed past it.||December 8, 2015
HatterWilko||40||Visited early on a Saturday at the recommendation of family. Interesting market, but you need to be hungry and with someone else willing to try interesting food. Unfortunately, we had just eaten and my daughter is very fussy.||December 7, 2015
SuzyQScotlandUk||40||If ever we wished we hadn't had breakfast this was it the best food staffs and variety we have ever seen we could have spend the day nibbling here. Good location near London bridge tube||December 7, 2015
Bill H||50||Visit even if closed. There are plenty of restaurants open and you can still walk around to see the sights. Don't let it discourage you.||December 7, 2015
lauryng298||50||Aboslutely great experience. you have a wide range of variety of food you can choose. Vegetarian, juices, oisters, italian, great paninis. It is a great choice for a saturday, if you don't mind eating while walking, no tables avaiable. Do not miss the hot wine, so worth it in the cold winter days :)||December 7, 2015
Martin R||50||No foodie trip to London will be complete without visiting Borough Market. just get off the london bridge tube station and it is right there! with a lot of food stalls to choose from, it was a feast for the senses too. they sell fresh seafood, meats, cheese, cakes, pastries, you name it they have it. most excellent coffee too. ||December 6, 2015
Jcpg45||40||have been many times, weekends are mad, too busy so best try very early or weekdays. lots to entice all pallets, have a go !||December 6, 2015
PKRV||50||Borough Market is world famous for the level and variety of food that it sells. And if you really want to experience it in all its glory then the later in the week, the better to see all the stalls open and get caught up in the atmosphere, sights, and especially smells.Wander round and marvel at everything that is available, and make sure you sample a few things too - there is something here to tickle and delight the taste buds of everyone.A real foodie heaven and always a great place to visit for locals, tourists, and everyone else.||December 6, 2015
Mick B||40||When I am in Southwark I always make the effort to call in on Borough Market. Here the past and present seem to have little difficulty in rubbing along with each other. There are plenty of food stalls in the enclosed area for every taste bud, but if you want to sit in relative comfort there are a number of excellent restaurants to chose from. I tend to use 'Fish' which nestles below Southwark Cathedral, and is always fairly busy when I visit. The lunchtime menu is not that expansive but what's on offer is more than sufficient. The fish dishes never disappoint and there is wine and local bottled real ale to choose from. If you have the time it is worth dropping into one of the nearby public houses. With glass in hand you can almost imagine you have travelled back in time.||December 6, 2015
dvsawafta||50||The place is so warm and you feel natural. The food was fantastic. Shops are viewing in old traditional way, but very clean and organised. You enjoy wondering there for hours and you don't feel time passing||December 6, 2015
Hannah jelly-gr... S||40||100% buy a GIANT white chocolate cookie, you can't miss them! And please get scotch tails!! I think they're there Mon-Wed :) You can walk there from any central location .. 2o mins wish from waterloo and its right next to the Shard and London Bridge.||December 6, 2015
Matkat_61||50||Made a bee line for this and not disappointed. Superb place to shop, really fresh and massive choice of foods. You can buy food to cook a banquet here. Also some great street food available. The market was buzzing and not to be missed||December 6, 2015
SandraIanTia||50||What a delight -- lovely range of food available lots of tasters too Buzzing , exciting and lots of characters Enjoyed our visit and will certainly go again next visit to London||December 5, 2015
Yolande G||40||This was my second visit to the Borough Market. So many different food experiences to be had here. There are many stalls selling food to eat right there (chorizo, lamb burgers, paella...) but there are also many stalls that are selling fresh produce, cheeses, meats, fresh fish, chocolate and much much more. It's very busy but the people are friendly.||December 5, 2015
jayyen93||50||Borough Market may not get the aerial pan like London Eye or Tower Bridge on TV shows or movies when the setting moves to London, but this is yet another must-go destination for all London tourists!Showing the hipster side of London, Borough Market is an open-air market under the London Bridge railway. Here, you will find not only the traditional market vendors like produce or butcher stands but also exotic unique goods that you may not see often elsewhere such as venison dogs and Egyptian street food. You don't have to buy anything to be intrigue by this terrific market, but at the same time, can you really resist the alluring aroma from everywhere if you aren't full?I highly recommend coming here as a lunch break between Tower Hill and Westminster. Keep in mind though that most food vendors accept cash only and each order is generally £5. However, there is an ATM on site, and some vendors that charge higher prices do accept credit cards so don't fret if you forgot to bring cash.Whether you are hungry or full, definitely make your way to visit Borough Market!---TIPS TO GET THE MAX:1) The best way is to simply wander around but grab a map for information2) Take a walk around before committing to a food choice: the vendors won't go away on the same day!3) Bring cash4) General seating area with information and restroom is on the intersection of Southwark and Cathedral Streets---tl;dr version:1) Awesome open-air market near London Bridge2) Classic market vendors along with exotic unique choices3) Perfect lunch spot but a must-go destination at anytime!||December 5, 2015
Cavershamroyals||50||The sights; the smells; the atmosphere; the choie; the unusual; the different; the quality;the location - I could go on. It is a brilliant experience and must be one of the best food markets anywehere. I reckon you could buy just about any food here and if you couldn't then I guess they would find it for you. Great for just wandering around but I'll bet you cannot leave with buying something from one of the many stalls. There are also quite a few good pubs around the market and the whole area is just so alive and vibrant! Don't miss it.||December 5, 2015
Daniellav4552||50||What an Awesome market .. Make sure you go there hungry stunning stalls and food markets . We had a Ciabatta sandwich from an Italian stall.. Absolutely delicious||December 4, 2015
Tom_Jerry_London||50||To eat indeed the choice is yours.The place is so full of beautiful food and ever so friendly people.Just wander around taking in the myriad of sights and the wonderful aromas that you don't need to eat.All this and just under the Shard as well.We bought some duck breasts,courgettes and winter squash and served them with hassleback potatoes. Just look at the images each says a thousand wordsEnjoy life...visit this place||December 4, 2015
hikeg||40||Search GOLD7778T in youtube for my travel Vlog worldwide and Asia to get more dinning experience on street food and low budget.It was a great place to hang around in London. Food, beer, cider, cheese,game meat, oyster, dessert, spice. Almost everything you want to eat in low budget.Remember to walk open area of food stall. More street food that I found cheaper. Hotdog in cold air outside is awesome.||December 4, 2015
KarenCCC2013||50||The place was great with a big fresh market and also hot food provided. Would recommend to visit earlier to avoid crowd. Tried a burger breakfast in the market and it was great!||December 4, 2015
Tricia115||50||I am a frequent visitor to the market, today was very special, as shared the experience with a group of 5 friends, the market is such a buzz with such friendly stalls and array of food out of this world. Every foodie should visit, so easy to get too.||December 3, 2015
Ioanna_A323||50||Borough market was a great gem that we were told about and (somehow) managed to find. The food display was wonderful and they have everything from fresh vegetables to cured meats, wines and much more! It's a food-focused market. Come hungry because you will want to try everything. ||December 3, 2015
IvaF225||50||We were walking around and just by accident found this gem. It was pretty early in the morning, so all the shops were not open yet. But, we looked around, had nice breakfast and a coffee. You can find food from all around the world on one place, and you can try local specialities made in front of you. When you get tired, you can yit on a nice bench or a table under the tree, with the view on the rush of the London streets. ||December 2, 2015
Wanderlust63CA||50||Stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel for the past 2 years and found this amazing market on our 1st day while waiting for our room to be ready... From Monmouth coffee, the food stalls during lunch, to Rabots 1745 for any chocolate drink you could imagine... Every food style, taste or craving will be met! Go spend an hour or even a day, this place should not be missed!||December 2, 2015
Welshiejo||50||When ever we are in London we always make sure we come here to experience different foods and buy the amazing cakes, cheeses, meats and everything that is on offer. The Egyptian street food was exceptional and a great portion size for the price. Amazing paella and sangria us also on offer here.||December 2, 2015
Heather S||50||A fantastic spot to stop for your next lunch or snack. Tons of incredible, local, street food vendors. Something for everyone!||December 2, 2015
CharlotteF013||40||There's a place that opens fresh oysters in the market - must try. Comes in different sizes - I don't normally eat raw oysters but this place sells really fresh ones for about 2-3GBP each.The market has a great vibe and lots of places to sample good ham and wines. Food stalls also serve a variety of delicious food.||December 2, 2015
WendyMartin1972||40||I work just round the corner and it is easy to forget just how lucky I am to have this on my doorstep ! Huge choice of amazing foods from independent suppliers - sticking up for Christmas is easy :-) love it ||December 2, 2015
paul w||50||Always a great place to good if you want fresh food or a bite to eat if your passing or close to London Bridge station .Various stalls selling fresh products ranging from bread, pies ,cakes ,curries ,pasties ,cheese drinks etc etc etc I could go on ! Let's say. something for everyone.A stall that does very different burgers ,these include zebra ,crocodile ,camel ,Kangaroo reindeer, and others I brought one of each I've tried others but can't wIt to try these in the coming month. Great for foodies and surrounded by local pubs so after you have eaten wash it down with a drink in a local bar , pub or wine bar.Tip ...at the bottom end you can get to the edge of the Thames and on a good day sit outside and have a drink and some food from thelocal pubs||December 1, 2015
elizabethd600||40||Can just wander taking in the aromas of street food and the beautifully presented fruit, vegetables, cheese, bread, flowers etc etc.Went to Roast for lunch situated above, and overlooking the market. Superb fish pie special. Spotless white linen tablecloths.Busy so best to book.Felt the authenticity of the market.Loved the Xmas wreath decorations - very in keeping.||December 1, 2015
CarmelaTan||50||very very good place to look for new produce. as you enter. different smells of food is there. very cool place to learn new dishes, ingredients new experience. although its a bit expensive. location is accessible by the tube.||November 30, 2015
Preston88||50||Love it here but God does it get busy at weekends. Tourist heaven. Go as soon as it opens to make most of it & then hang around if you enjoy hustle & bustle. Lovely fresh different food available ||November 30, 2015
Clare W||50||So much to see and smell.Had the most amazing burrito from a stall called soul food.I will definately go again.||November 30, 2015
RyRN||30||Place was very lively with many stalls selling an assortment of goods. Loved the fact that there are many food options which looked very yummy! ||November 30, 2015
AgataPawlowska||50||If coming back from Tower Bridge and heading to Tate Modern stop at Borough Market or cross London just to pay it a visit. Located under an old bridge with its vintage look Borough offers best culinary and shopping experience. Everything from burgers, paella, Indonesian curry, champagne and wine bars to sausages, fresh juices and French cheese or honey. Closed on Sunday and bustling with life on Saturday afternoon is not to be missed! Pay attention when walking next to it, as u may miss the garden located bit down from the road! Real treat for home-grown chefs ||November 29, 2015
FollowingFinney||50||Holy crap, such amazing food! I wish I was more hungry. If I lived in London I would be here regularly to pick up items to make at home. As it was-I grabbed a great Greek spinach thing and wandered around in awe admiring the veggies, meats, deserts, breads, oils, wines......oh so much food!I think only open on weekdays, most (all?) stalls were closed when we walked through again on Sunday.||November 29, 2015
yorkshireterrier18||50||I had often heard about Borough Market on TV programs and on a visit to London, decided to make this a priority. I'm so glad I did. I often say why can't we have markets in England like those in Europe (I'm thinking of Barcelona and Madeira) However this was fabulous with such a range of foodstuffs that I was sad I couldn't take more things away with me. (next time I'll go just before we get the train home) All in all it was well worth a visit and very convenient for the Shard, The Globe Theatre and The Tate Modern.||November 29, 2015
Marcia G||50||Great place to go with friends and try some of the various delicious street foods. The only drawback is that there is no place to sit and enjoy.||November 29, 2015
tonyrG7870BA||50||What a fantastic market, loads to see and great range of different foods, it was buzzing,Not open on a Sunday though||November 29, 2015
Keneff||50||A great collection of food orientated stalls. Fruit and veg, fish, meat, cheeses, pies, confectionary are all here. If you get peckish admiring all that food, a variety of hot and cold food and drink stalls and a number of restaurants in the surrounding streets provide all you could wish for. Worth a visit.||November 28, 2015
AmyAileen||50||My Great-Nan used to shop here, so it was important to me to visit here on my trip to London. It was more than I could have hoped for. Get there early on a Friday to beat the rush. Incredible diversity of food, I can't imagine leaving the market feeling anything but happy. We bought a fresh loaf of ciabatta bread, 10 pounds worth of Comte cheese, fresh grapes, a couple of treats and then settled into our hotel room with a bottle of wine and ate it all of dinner. Can get expensive if you want to try everything (which you will, but its a matter if you do it or not).||November 28, 2015
Nick W||50||This is a large collection of street food outlets of almost all types from the humble hot dog to exotic wraps all cooked fresh in front of you. Once your food is purchased there is ample outdoor (but covered) seating for you to sit and eat in comfort. Reminds me of the Biscuit Factory in Cape town actually. There are some cheese stalls and artisan bread stalls also. Unfortunately staying as we are at the Shangri-La at the Shard we had had a monstrous breakfast so were to full to eat here - maybe tomorrow!!!||November 28, 2015
Koughti1||50||We went here after a Saturday in London to get some tea. We all had something different from a different stand as there was simply so much choice and everything smelled delicious. I had a scotch egg and salad. The others had and grilled cheese, a burger and a Thai veggie noodle varied but would definitely go again if we fancied fast but good food. We arrived as it was finishing up for the day and so I would love to go along in the day time when all the stands are open. Probably some lovely Xmas gifts available here. ||November 28, 2015
Alistaire2001||40||Perhaps on a Saturday lunchtime we should have expected it to be so busy, but who cares, the 'rush and push' just made it more interesting. Queues at all hot foodstalls and such a variety, and then on to buy the freshest meat and such a variety of vege for tonight's meal (I mean amazing varieties of mushrooms, aubergines, tomatoes and any colour of beetroot!). Need a rest then nip round to Monmouth's for a coffee. But, beware time has a habit of evaporating here... And don't forget to choose your cheeses before you leave, If you can tear yourself away. It's not cheap but it's good!||November 26, 2015
lyz-the-activist||50||The aroma tantalises you before you see the food. Welcome to Borough market, one of the oldest and largest food markets in London. Open Monday to Saturday, this foodie's delight offers international cuisine as well as fresh produce. How is this market awesome? An independent panel ensures that the high quality is fulfilled and maintained.Highly recommended for lunch. ||November 25, 2015
AlfonsoMF||50||It was some time since the last time I visited it. It has been rebuilt in many areas, cleaned and "polished". Now it looks even more beautiful than before. The constant bustle of people and shopkeepers on Fridays, the colors, the high range of all kind of food, the different environments..., all make you feel you went back in the time. When visiting London this place is a MUST.||November 25, 2015
HoustonJoe88||50||We vacation in London every year and one of the must stops for us is the Borough Market just off London Bridge. It is a great market to just wander around although we usually make a point of having lunch there, especially the Salted Beef Sandwich from Northfield Kitchen.||November 25, 2015
JRCSF||50||I've been a couple of times before, usually at the weekend and never really been that impressed. Visited a couple of weeks ago on a Friday and it was a totally different experience. Loads of vendors offering food and drink to satisfy anyone. A separate semi-covered hall with street food vendors covered us off for lunch.I'd suggest anyone visiting London check this out. London Bridge tube is just around the corner and it allows for a nice walk along south bank.||November 25, 2015
VodkaHelen||50||This place is just buzzing full of life with lots of fab food stalls and lots of gift ideas. The value is fantastic, I only wish I had a booked a bag onto the plane home to allow me buy lots more goodies. Definitely worth a visit. ||November 24, 2015
Kimbolulu||50||The smells of all the different food is fantastic.i bet you can not go through the market without eating something?..They is a lots of things to do in the local area.eg golden hind ,Shard And Tower of London.||November 24, 2015
daffynee||40||The place are made up of many mini stores, from ice cream, cold brew coffee, refreshing ice tea, pasta, burger and more. Remember to come with an empty stomach to try all the food. :) If you are tea lover, do try the tea from "Greenfield Farm, Organic LIFE". Their ice tea (£2.50) is awesome! If you are a beef lover, do try the steak burger from "Wild Highland Venison" @ £7||November 24, 2015
Laurie R||40||We walked through this very large market and enjoyed seeing all the different types of food served. As Americans, its nice to see what people in other countries eat and buy. Some places were very crowded, and some offered samples. I think you could buy anything you wanted in this market! (And nearby is a beautiful cathedral, and the London Bridge tube station)||November 24, 2015
Donna L||40||I'd seen a picture of Borough Market in a guide book and wanted to be sure we saw it! Be sure to plan your bus route to get here and back because we did a lot of extra walking to get back to our hotel. The market itself was fascinating and we loved looking at all the food, flowers & cheese !||November 24, 2015
Wouter G||50||Borough Market is one of those places that makes a city an interesting place. It offers great food stalls, both for takeaway as eating on the go as well as great place to have breakfast and lunch.||November 23, 2015
EndaTravel||40||If Whole Foods and a local farmers' market had a baby, it would produce Borough Market. It offers the best of the best such as old world cheeses from Paris and mushroom pate and black truffle oil from the countryside of England. It is a place to get lost and let your foodie dreams take hold. Half of the market is enclosed and the other half is open air. So, don't be deterred if it is a rainy day. The market has almost anything that you could want. My colleague had chicken curry while I was tasting French cheese at a stand nearby. My favorite booth was the Raclette served Swiss style. We ordered broiled raclette scraped and served over new potatoes with cornichons. So very good. We also found mulled cider, mulled coffee, white truffle honey along with Nutella-filled donuts. We even found Grenadian nutmeg syrup at one of the vendors. Overall, a great place to get lost in a foodie paradise for two to three hours. Tip: Located near the Shard building which has amazing views of central London.||November 23, 2015
AlexandriaSion||40||This is where you go for unadulterated great food. The meat is from animals who live in fresh air, take exercise and eat green grass. The fish have bright eyes. The vegetables are maybe sometimes mis-shapen, but have colour and robustness. The pies look like pies should. Lots of stalls have foreign goodies, from salamis to cheeses to wines. Shopping here is a delight, always you can find everything you want to buy, and things you want but didnt come out to buy.||November 23, 2015
LmDalton||50||We almost didn't make it to Borough Market, thinking it wasn't going to be anything to write home about--and it ended up being one of our favorite London experiences. We ate some delicious food and wanted to eat more. The wonderful smells and sights and sounds of this quaint market make it a complete sensory experience.||November 22, 2015
Anny T||50||Wow wow wow best to eat before you go shopping there, or go on an empty stomach but take your time to decide what to feast on. Incredible selection of the finest of everything - including truffles, venison burgers...||November 22, 2015
sue h||40||Love this market, it's so lively and buzzing. Amazing food selections from around the world, could have spent a fortune but had to think how we would get it all home ---- great fun to be had for all age groups ---especially us foodies.||November 22, 2015
yabbienutter||40||This is a really cool market I stubled upon with great food choices from around the world. Whilst it gets very busy and hard to make your way to the front of some food queues, this is obviously the sign of a very good setup. Worth a visit and to grab some lunch and market fresh food.||November 22, 2015
thesammigirl||40||you can always choose to have breakfast or Lunch over here and end with Commonman coffee. the sandwich or some dish that only here is available. then start walking to London bridge. it is not a super far walk but a long walk with nice weather. take picture now and every then. never get bored about it ||November 21, 2015
007pallavim||50||I absolutely fell in love with this place.. there is so much of food and buzz around. You can eat from oysters to fresh seafood to best dishes from around the world. I am definitely going to come here again very soon!||November 21, 2015
CKY281||40||My wife and I have been visiting this market annually for the past few years whenever we get into London. A visit to London isn't complete without coming here. Saturday is the best day with all stalls open and peak crowds comprising as many races /nationalities as the variety of food from all corners of the world. Most stalls do offer free tasting samples to showcase their merchandise. The street food stalls draw the most crowds but the quality do vary a lot. Many stalls sell fresh ingredients like fresh fruits & vegetables and raw seafood and meat. For me, a feast of fresh raw oysters makes my day. ||November 21, 2015
Itsthesmallthings||50||I LOVE Borough Market...it's a foodies dream. Diverse range of street foods from Ethiopian, Japanese, salt beef bagels to traditional English foods like pie & mash. Amazing baked goods too. Worth a visit, any out of town visitors will be very happy ....go hungry! ||November 21, 2015
Kicki1969||50||One of the oldest - and the best markets! Especially for foodies. The most amazing cheeses and other produce can be bought here - as well as sweeter stuff! Lots of places to stop and have a coffee or a delicious lunch. Set within one of the most fascinating parts of London. Visit the view from the Shard while you are here and walk past The Globe. Fantastic in all weathers!||November 21, 2015
Hawk470||50||On a cold, blustery day the crowds, enclosure, and diverse sights and scents of Borough Market were just what we needed. Fantastic array of global foods ready to indulge, mulled wine and cider, and glorious fresh produce, meats, fish, olives, sweets, and cheese were a gustatory and visual delight. If you don't like crowds, go earlier or later, but if you don't mind them or find people in all their variety energizing, by all means go in mid-day. With incredibly diverse food stalls, you can have a month of lunches with more to spare||November 21, 2015
Cartertravels15||50||We were up in London yesterday waiting to get into Vinopolis and decided to explore the market.What a gem and judging by the amount of people very popular.Friendly stall holders and very tasty food to buy .We were here at lunchtime and the smells of food were amazing.Next time in London will visit here again.||November 21, 2015
F2398WXkarenr||50||First stop the champagne stall. Glass in hand now wander around these fantastic food stalls. The aromas of spices, the colourful fruit and vegetables. Then try and decide which food to have for lunch. This is a truly fabulous place to spend some time.||November 20, 2015
sausuetw||50||I was there on a rainy morning and I was so glad to have many hot food at the market. The stall owners were really nice and love to chat with you about their handmade products. I really like the handmade jams that I tasted but so regret that I didn't buy one!! I will definitely go again. ||November 19, 2015
gooner350350||50||Visit Borough Market, it is an extraordinary market catering for food lovers from all over the world. The variety of fresh produce available to try and buy is exceptional. The buzz of the market from both tourists and stall holders lends itself to a great atmosphere, the only down side is that you can't quite buy it all !||November 19, 2015
LHsiang||40||I always like to visit various local market when I travel. I read that Borough Market is the market which you shouldn't miss when visiting London. The market is closed to the London bridge which you can access by either tube, bus, or any other transportation. We stepped into the market, the first stand comes to my eyes was the Oyster booth. It was just the right season for this delicacy and people were waiting in line ( good sign). The oysters were super fresh and immediately as for the second dishes. After that, we walked into the market, you can see various stand with cheese, bread, olive ,and many more! You just don't know where to focus on. Be honest, if I could, I would love wrap pack the whole market away!!Later, we went to the other section with the instant deli where they served German, Greek, Chinese, Ethiopian food , and many more. Shame that I have one stomach only. Overall, it's good place for you to spend a half day where you can enjoy the fresh good,purchase some groceries, and have good time with friends. Highly recommend to visit!||November 19, 2015
TheGoodFoodBoy||50||A wonderful array lf sights, sounds and importantly smells. The food market is off the charts good. Something for everyone from everywhere. Go take your taste buds on an adventure! ! ||November 18, 2015
Kernow99||30||Despite the market being advertised as open on a Monday lunchtime, very few stalls were and it was very quiet so no atmosphere which was disappointing. ||November 18, 2015
Felix L||50||This is a large and old food market selling raw ingredients as well as ready to eat food. It cells everything from the usual fruits, to homemade jams, cheese, as well as unusual meat such as boar and crocodile, as well as different seafood. Definitely go on an empty stomach to try its variety of stalls selling delicious burgers, wraps, paellas and much more! The food isn't exactly cheap, with a burger costing around 6 pounds, although food in London isn't exactly cheap anyway. It is open between Thursday to Sunday for lunch hours||November 18, 2015
winningpost51||50||A wonderful place to spend a Saturday morning, cannot think of a bad word, other than its toooo busy!! ;-)Highly recommended!||November 18, 2015
Paul M||50||Brilliant for trying many different foods such as cheese, oils and chutneys. Also a great range of street food - favourites include the salt beef sandwich, fish finger sandwich, the borough market burger, Indian street food. You need to be hungry if you visit here and are best to go early or late on a Saturday as it gets very busy and can be quite difficult to find some space to eat. In winter it is also cold so take a coat.||November 18, 2015
hiba A||50||the full market opens from Wednesday till Saturday from 8:00am, a great place for fresh food (cheese, cold cuts, etc.) fresh vegetables and of course international cuisine. If you are going for vegetables and fruit shopping i suggest you go early (preferably Wednesday or Thursday as it is less busy), also make sure you have checked all vegetable/fruits stalls in order to see all the offers available and to get the best one for you. ||November 18, 2015
slods79||50||Wow, this market next to the London Bridge is absolutely foodie heaven. You can find a huge variety of fresh produce and food to eat, it would be impossible to walk away hungry....just amazing and very much worth a visit if you love food. ||November 18, 2015
yellowhaus||50||A friend told me about this market. It is a great place to have lunch on a budget. There were so many choices it was hard to pick just one. All the vendors were very nice and many gave out free samples (fudge, cheese, tea, etc). It is a bit out of the way but worth a visit. ||November 18, 2015
662harryb||50||Loads of great street food and everything from seafood to fine chocolates we loved borough market and will visit every time we go to the capital!||November 18, 2015
Wong D||50||You will not regret coming here. The only regret is not having a bigger stomach. It is like having breakfast, lunch and dinner altogether at one go. We were here for breakfast and coming soon for lunch. Try the hot wine on a cold weather. Yummy!||November 18, 2015
Linda M||40||Wonderful market with an array of cultures, flavours and smells. an attack on the senses. Not to to be missed.||November 17, 2015
Kevin J||50||Loved Borough Market. So much to say, so many different food types, atmosphere amazing.Make are hungry before you visit, you will not be disappointed||November 17, 2015
MargaretW2223||40||Visited on a Tuesday very quiet which was suprising. Street food is popular and good price - extremely tasty; cheese and fish stalls expensive so didn't tryVery clean market Would visit again on a non rainy day!! ||November 17, 2015
cliveyyym||40||Never heard of this before I visited recetly on a Uni trip, we called at Borough Market for lunch and all split off to find our own preference. I went to a chinese stand and had a Duck Wrap which was delicious and only £7 and it was pretty big and filling. Also great for treats such as various flavoured fudge, many choices of cakes, cookies, chocolates etc. A really nice place to visit for lunch if you're in the area.||November 17, 2015
Jannerbloke||50||Anyone who has come down the steps from London Bridge Road around the corner of the Cathedral hoping to catch the bustle and delights if this great Market only to discover too late that it is closed on Sunday needs to be reminded that we are less than three weeks away from Christmas opening. You could also follow the link to the Market website to whet your appetite and check the times.||November 16, 2015
Quevivalavida||50||Visit all the corners of the world at this bustling stop! The smells alone will make you want to crave a little bit of everything. My duck confit sandwich was so simple yet so delicious! Warm toasted buns and the confit was just the right amount of fat to keep me warm on that windy day!||November 16, 2015
AJVaughnDOTcom||40||I could have honestly spent the whole day here nibbling on just about everything they had. I would have spend a ton of cash and gained 100 pounds in a day, but I would have been smiling. There is so much to see and experience. Just about every type of food stall and touristy thing you could imagine. If I lived close by, I'd buy all my veg, fruit and meats here and some prepared foods also. There are tons of baked goods. Lots of meat pies and Scotch Eggs and sweets to go. Some looked wonderful and others not so great. Pick you stall carefully.  If your wanting sweets, you need look no further. I had to cup my hand around my eyes like blinders on a horse, just so my waist wouldn't expand from the sight of all that delicious, sugary perfection. There are some great fast food type of stall cooking everything under the sun. The aromas were tantalizing.  One of the best things was the people watching. A large number are obviously tourists looking just as fascinated as you will be. Stroll, don't run and have a very pleasant time.||November 16, 2015
amyj1020||40||I'd suggest going early. We were there at lunchtime and by the time we left you could barely walk. So much food though! Delicious stands, lots of vegetarian options as well. ||November 15, 2015
WorJeff266||50||Amazing collection of stalls selling every imaginable food from all corners of the world. We had a very reasonably priced lunch and a pitcher of Pimms to wash it down with. A must must location to visit when near The Shard. ||November 15, 2015
jarmwr40||40||stopped here on the #10 bus from our great aribnb condo on the river thames. wandered about trying to decide on a choice, so many. quite a crowd, obviously a popular spot. we shared a chicken dish. we had things to do so didn't spend much time here, but one could easily!||November 15, 2015
NAS1954||50||If you could go somewhere everyday to get your fix of vibrancy, then this is it. It is full of young and old and is definitely the place to be. The food is outstanding as is the variety and having travelled the world can say this meets anywhere I've been before.||November 15, 2015
Laurens D||50||Great atmosphere and super tasty food highly recommend for people who are only staying a few days. Right near the beautiful shard tower. ||November 15, 2015
Marian c||50||We were entranced by the variety of foodstuffs and by the street food stalls. We loved sampling the various foods. This is a place to tempt the taste buds!||November 15, 2015
awayaday||50||Close to the attractions of the Shard, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre and Southwark Cathedral, this is a 'must do ' for visitors to the South Bank area. A fantastic selection of fruit and vegetables and hot and cold food stalls with an amazing array of tastes from all around the world. I found the stall holders to be friendly and fun, easy to spend lots of money here !!||November 14, 2015
dmbfan7716||50||My 9 year old daughter and I spent 2 hours in this market just looking around and eating everything in sight. There is so much variety and it allows you to go outside your comfort zone. She sampled goat milk ice cream, which she loved. Love this place!!!||November 14, 2015

The fruit and vegetable stalls had things I had never seen before and the stall holders were happy to answers questions even though they were busy. so glad we came across this jewel of a market.||November 14, 2015
maaagick||50||A perfect place for family visit hovewer I found out a lot of people dressed up like in middle ages which is sooo sutable for this old market. Also you can easily find strange foods here. All in all I liked to watch people and try different things here. Great look on Halloween and Christmas||November 14, 2015
Rubyann40||50||What a fabulous market. What a great improvement from years ago, Food from the four corners of the World, freshly cooked and served. Of course, U.K. vegetables, etc. as well. Even if you aren't hungry, take a camera and enjoy the colours of the displays, fish, roast pig, cheeses, wine and so on. Don't eat before you go as you will miss out! Eat on "the hoof" or at restaurants or bistros. Only five minutes walk from The Shard.||November 14, 2015
Leodwain||40||A really colourful market with vegetables and fruit, smoothies and food. I would highly recommend the roast hog rolls.||November 13, 2015
Phayao13||40||Here you find foodies, ordinary tourists and Londoners who buy ingredients for dinner Not so many decades ago, London has something of a gastronomic desert and now met by this amazing abundance of wonderful commodities.If you are unable to shop for home, there are lots of places offer amazing taste samples of what is best for the day.||November 13, 2015
KMiller17||50||Stopped by the market for lunch and was not disappointed. We went from stall to stall eating various dishes. I think our favorite food was a vegetable curry. The atmosphere is lovely. Wish we had time to go into the cathedral next to the market. Maybe next time.||November 13, 2015
PapaYM||50||On a busy Saturday it's a brilliant place to visit, the choice & standard of food to go & to take home is amazing. You just don't know what to choose as you are spoilt for choice & could spend a fortune. It's not buzzing on other days as we found out on a previous visit during the week.||November 13, 2015
sadunalp||40||Very interesting area,it is not a big place and did not cover my expectations.I walked around and finished the market in couple of minutes.But later on I went on very carefully and understood the importance of this market.Mostly you can find all kind of cheese from anywhere of the orld,prices are depends on the country and the quality ofcourse.Also you can taste a lot of things and I strongly admire you that before you decide to go you must be hungry.You can also see lots of selected vines.Market area is not crowded so that you can spend sometime there.You can meet good dishes also if you go around.Enjoy it.Nice and interesting place to see.||November 13, 2015

Sarah-Louise_mary||50||Loads of stalls, loads of samples, friendly and helpful staff except one. I wanted to buy a cup of mulled wine and he shouted over "I'm placing a very important order I will be with you in 5 minutes". I went to the stall next door and got it there instead where the woman was attentive and checked the temperature and talked me through the options. Great way to spend an hour or so ||November 11, 2015
Joanne B||40||My husband and I visited Borough Market late October after a recommendation from a family member. It's a lovely foody market with everything from cheese, to biscuits, to ostrich burgers, to veg etc Loads of samples, which were fab, I recommend the venison burger! The smells in the street food section were amazing, hog roasts, burgers etc and the toasted cheese sandwiches smelt absolutely divine (so disappointed that we weren't hungry!!). Nice to see the stalls with their little halloween touches to! Would be nice to see at christmas!||November 11, 2015
Christian M||40||We arrived on a saturday, and the market was crowded, alot. But nonetheless people in the booths were smiling handing us samples and tastes of everything. Can recommend going 1-2 hours. Grab some food and enjoy the place under the rail.||November 11, 2015

Rim D||50||If you are looking for quality products and spice up your food you have to go to Borouh Market, you will find all kind of fruits, vegetables, spices... It offers a wide choice of products coming from worldwide. Perfect place to have a quick and very tasty lunch, you can find several stalls offering all kind of food, indian, ethiopian, jamaican, delicious bagels.... everything is so mouthwatering and I tasted most of them and I have never been disapointed. Then you can carry on your stroll around London Bridge to reach to Tower Bridge, a perfect program which would last an entire day.||November 11, 2015
SHARMAND3R||50||Thoroughly enjoyed walking through this market. There is a variety of different food options from all over the world, and this would be a prime place to find 'groceries' not seen in chain stores. Great selection, great atmosphere, especially for foodies.||November 11, 2015
georgiasing||50||This food market is a great way to experience a variety of cuisines. They have so much on offer, and heaps of taste testers, which you can fill your stomach on alone. There's a variety of fresh produce, and they make all food orders in front of you. I would try to avoid going on a weekend, as it's almost impossible to move. All the sellers are welcoming and happy for you to try anything. Bring your family or friends and have a sangria, paella finished off with a decadent dessert. ||November 10, 2015
poneal410||50||Great family oriented place to visit with shops, plenty of different types of food, a great view of the Thames and restaurants.Worth a visit if you are staying in one of the hotels nearby, and just a short walk from London Bridge Underground.||November 10, 2015
932kevl||50||We had the fortune to visit the market at the end of October on a lovely autumn day. The food, fruit and veg is multi-national as is the street food which is competitively priced and decent value. I went for a spicy malaysian chicken curry which was spot on with fragrant rice. There is lots to do, see and buy with loads of tasters on offer. The market is surrounded by top notch eateries, restaurants and trendy bars - truly spoilt for choice. A must see on the south bank of the Thames.||November 9, 2015
McAnnie1||50||You cannot visit London without a trip to Borough market. Fantastic cheese stalls, amazing breads & delicious street food. Can't resist a sausage roll & prosecco rose every visit.||November 9, 2015
opal91086||40||We were doing a walk from the Tower of London to the Tate Museum and stumbled upon this fabulous little market! Options were like going to Epcot!!! Everything from breads, pizza, sausages, Egyptian, Indian, Greek, German...deserts. Great stop for an on the go lunch or snack.||November 9, 2015
krezie23||40||It is worth a visit even if you are simply going to try the street food so best not to have eaten for a few hours before because there is so much to try. Don't forget to check the schedule for the busiest days and great place to buy food ingredients for back home too.||November 9, 2015
Vera0802||40||Visited with family, loads to see, thoroughly enjoyed the abundance of smells from the various food stalls. Definitely a place to visit if in London, loved the umbrellas.||November 9, 2015

PMitch59||50||Love visiting the market whenever we are in London, so much quality produce. wish there were more places like this outside of London||November 9, 2015
GarethSW||50||This really is a must place to visit when in London. So much to do and so much to eat! Give yourself time and plan your route through the market. Do check on line to make sure the full market is open as it is not open everyday of the week. There is such a great atmosphere and you can try some wonderful food! ||November 8, 2015
Jason F||50||Loads to see, an abundance of sellers enthusiastic about the quality and provenance of their produce. There's a great buzz around the market, plenty of samples to entice your tastebuds and many places to enjoy a drink and something to eat whilst watching the world go by. Richard Hayward's oysters is a great example. What could be better than half a dozen oysters and a glass of Prosecco on a Saturday afternoon? Well worth a good couple of hours of your time to meander round, soak up the atmosphere and enjoy a drink and bite to eat.||November 8, 2015
LizzyLizburger||50||Our family had a great morning here wandering around the amazing food stalls, and tasting all sorts of things. There are no obvious tourists here, just locals buying yummy treats for themselves. I thoroughly enjoyed feeling the buzz of the surrounds and it was nice to do something a bit different||November 8, 2015
jameselee2016||50||Plenty to look at in here and the smell of the food is so nice. Also if you want special cheeses and special foods such as nuts and spices then you will not be disappointed always pop in here when visiting London and there are some lovely pubs and restaurants within a few minutes walk. Get here early to avoid the rush||November 8, 2015
kevinsO7464EO||50||Been visiting for past 15 years. Although it has undergone major refurbishment still is such a great place to visit . Great fresh veg, meat, pasta, and soon many heath food stores, and even a bar for champers||November 7, 2015

Zoe S||50||So I stumbled on this market after visiting the Shard. What a find! Fresh food that makes you want to get in the kitchen. Truffles to smell, appreciate & purchase. Cheese heaven. Hot food street style, fresh oysters, OMG the list is sooo long. Plus that fabulous cockney welcome. Also spotted the property used for Bridget Jones films. Market manager spotted us photographing it and came over to tell us filming crews were coming back that Sunday! Had a great visit, definitely recommend a browse if your in the area!||November 6, 2015
sazgirl||50||I have now been here on 2 occasions (1 a busy Saturday, 1 a quite Sunday) Amazing place and food EVERYWHERE. So many different things to choice from and free samples everywhere. I had previously never visited this side of the Thames but I will make sure I visit the markets at every opportunity I can.Its a must see and you get a lovely view of The Shard. Tip: Prob no the best place to bring a child or prams as there are lots of crowds||November 6, 2015
jalebibai2015||40||Oh this is foodie heaven! And what amazing stuff is available as merchandise - ostrich eggs for sale! Loved, loved loved it - go on a weekend, it's crowded, but its more fun that way! Very good restaurants too nearby and a great pub, right near the entrance.||November 5, 2015
Treepa_Island||50||Fantastic market! Bustling & energetic it's everything you'd expect a London market to me!A vast range of street food (including a number of vegan, vegiterian and international dishes) to try as well as everything else from fresh veg and milkshakes to chocolate and smoothies!Well worth a visit. Me and my girlfriend enjoyed the famous 'salt beef sandwich' - underestimating portion sizes we bought one each! She ended up giving her second piece to a homeless guy across the road who was over the moon! (The sandwich was lovely by the way, the vendor wasn't shy with the meat either!)Quickly little place to visit, and convenient for a pint on the Thames afterwards!||November 5, 2015
AllyLogan77||40||I have read so much about the Borough Market, and it certainly didn't let me down. I actually went twice during my stay in London. During the weekend, it was extremely fill, however during the week it is nice and quite. The produce, cheese, meat and fish they sell it top class. I tried so delicious English cheese, and I was seriously impressed. ScotchTails have a stand there and I had the best scotch egg I have ever had, and coupled with crispy sweet potato fries, you have a winner. I also tried a pie (with all the extras such as mash, mushy peas and crispy shallots) which also delivered. There is a stall that roasts a whole pig on a spit, and you can get a great sandwich from this. Definitely worth a try!||November 4, 2015
Edward068||40||We made the mistake of going to Borough Market on a sunny Saturday – we were joined with the rest of London – or at least it felt that way! Next time we visit Borough Market on a weekday morning soon after it opens. We were able to see something through the crowds and what we saw was wonderful both for shopping, eating as you wonder or just taking in the beauty and energy of the Market. ||November 4, 2015
LVagabond2014||50||Maybe because it was Saturday, but it was jampacked with people, as well as vendors with a variety of things and food to offer. A delight to senses! We didn't linger here due to the congestion. Instead, we went to the Wright's Brothers restaurant. Review coming up.||November 4, 2015
Lori_b_20||50||I went here on a Saturday afternoon. It was a lot of fun especially if you like variety. There are many samples to try to (some I love and some I hated). I ended up getting a salami, cheese, bread, olives, and wine (all from different places) and had lunch on a bench. ||November 4, 2015
ruben h||50||The borough market is fresh, tasty and very friendly. I would suggest you look for shops and restaurants in the surrounding blocks that utilize these fresh ingredients in their dishes. There is a deli/meat store very close that serves meat pies and other traditional goodies that takes advantage of these fresh ingredients.||November 4, 2015
WhereU2||40||Have visited on numerous occasions and still love it. So many food stalls to taste and purchase items. I agree with other reviews that it is usually very busy on a Saturday and not all stalls are open. The full market is better and in my experience quieter so easier to look around, taste test and purchase. Can be very crowded around the hot food stalls but worth the queue. I particularly like the Bratwurst with everything!||November 4, 2015
4Andos||50||we have been a few times now and love going back. Lots of bustle and great smells. Fabulous range of food to try and then there's the wonderful ingredients to make it yourself. Cuisine from around the UK and the globe. Tapas, oysters and champagne bars ! You can spend hours here if you are a goodie. Our girls (age 10 and 11) loved it but I would have liked to take them as younger children or in a pram due to how busy it is.||November 3, 2015
rickyspa1||40||If you like food (and you are ready to spend over the odds) this is a great place to be, the food selection, the quality, the variety, the sights, the smells, everything is brilliant if you are a gourmet or like nice food or you are just curious about world cuisine. All of this comes at a price, that in my experience is worth paying. If in South London pay it a visit||November 2, 2015
stig l||20||This market is rated number 5 in the world. No 1 is some place in Hong Kong, best in Europe is in Barcelona. But Bourough nothing special. Bad restaurants. Few places to sit down inside market. Not many choices food wise. If you come to Europe go to Stockholm and Ostermalmshallen. Best market||November 1, 2015
Marmatjj||50||Loved it...had a great time and could easily spend a few hours here. Lots of food to sample and buy. Visited on a Wednesday mid-morning as the full market is open (Mon/Tues open for lunch only) and we were advised it would be less crowded than weekends. It still got pretty busy by lunchtime at the food stalls though. Great atmosphere, vendors were very friendly and called you over to sample their food. Everything was so enticing. Try it all!! Definitely a must see place for foodies....so sad I can't bring most of the goodies back home on the plane!! Drop by the guest services office to sign up for newsletter and recipes and check out their website before going to see if any special events.||November 1, 2015
Andyf64a||50||Have been to Borough market on a number of occasions and have always been impressed with the selection of food on offer! Cooks paradise!||November 1, 2015
bobbysumarkho||40||Very busy in the weekend when we came here. Many stalls selling so many different types of food from different country. I tried the roast duck wrap, very good especially with the special made extremely spicy chili sauce. My wife bought hummus and warm pita bread. We also tried grill fresh scallops which I think was just okay. There were several stalls that sold similar dish but I guess I didn't pick the right one. I also bought some dried mushrooms to bring home for cooking. We had a good couple of hours here. The location was very convinient just a few hundreds yards away from tube station.||November 1, 2015
maclauk||30||This is possibly the best collection of food stalls in the entire UK. We had a lunch booking nearby and it was all I could not not to buy any one of 10's of delicious ready to eat food options here. The array of ingredients for your own cooking is unrivalled anywhere else in Britain. This would be a 5 star attraction except for the crowds. It is staggeringly busy. It was often hard to get to the counter to buy the food for the tourists standing there picturing it. Moving round it was a case of inserting oneself in the very slow flow of people heading roughly in that direction.Next time I'll try to time it to avoid the crowds.||November 1, 2015
Quinster||50||Don't miss this if you are a foodie - it is a foodie's paradise. Go for lunch or buy all the goodies for a feast at home. ||October 31, 2015
rmwso||50||Go early if you'd like to get attentive service from vendors when it is less crowded The market gets very busy by lunch time. So many good & exotic food to experience.||October 31, 2015
RuthHale1980||50||This market excites me every time I visit, the sights snd smells blow my mind. Everywhere you look there is food being cooked from around the world, people munching on said food and soaking up the atmosphere. The bread and cheese stalls always grab me, I literally can't resist them so why should I? I come home with lots of goodies. My son and I visited yesterday, I was my sons first visit, he ate a sausage bap, it was the best sausage bap he'd ever eaten. This market is a must for any foodie, from meat to bread to cheese to spices, this market has it all and never disappoints me. Plus, I love how friendly the traders are. I look forward to my next visit ||October 31, 2015
cherrybomb55||40||This is a must visit for all foodies - come just before lunchtime to avoid the crowd. Lots of delicious food, sights and smells - take your time to walk through the market and enjoy the wafts of deliciousness permeating the air every turn. Tried the fish and chip - it was really nice!||October 31, 2015
Semih A||50||Bridget jones diary movie location. A covered fresh food bazaar. First time i saw yellow tomato here. You may find a remarkable cheese and bread assortment here. And we saw a Turkish delight market here. Its easy to have cooked fresh food as takeaway meal at reasonable price.||October 31, 2015
ToucheTurtles||50||Lots of delicious food. So much variety. All the stall holders we spoke to were friendly and informative. A great way to learn about food and get free samples at the same time.||October 31, 2015
Midoriya||30||Since it's Halloween time, the place looked amazing with lots of carved pumpkins and many tourists were taking pictures. However after initial excitement I have soon realised there are so many similar stalls of cheese, olive oil, sausage and meats... Even big vegetable stalls carry similar ranges lacking oriental, Asian, African variety. Maybe people say there are Chinatown, Walthamstow etc, catering those variety, but why only sell apples and berries etc, ready available from supermarkets? My biggest disappointment was in bread, cakes, etc. Yes there are bakeries selling huge roaves and French and Italian breads, but I wanted see more traditional cakes like lemon drizzle, carrot cakes, etc, not just doughnuts and brownies! ||October 30, 2015
geroffmicloud||50||For foodies a must . Lots of eateries of all persuasions crammed in a small area . With market stalls selling all King of food stuffs from still swimming lobsters to Welsh cheese . Great throbbing atmosphere . Close to Shard . Worth a visit for atmosphere food and shopping||October 30, 2015
RoseKD||50||I've been waiting to go to this market. I had bbq chicken wrap and it was delicious. I loved it anand would sure love to visit again. ||October 29, 2015
sharnz1||40||Spent a couple weeks working near Borough Market and spent a few lunchtimes walking around.Very busy at lunchtime...a lot of people.Great fresh food stalls with lots to choose from.Love the fresh fruit and fresh juices that you can buy.Will definitely go back again when I am in that part of town. ||October 29, 2015
Cathy20155280||50||Lots of people, lots of noise - fresh food stalls, fruits, vegetables, meats, cheese, bread, flowers - you name it, they have it! Plus lots of different food vendors. Great fun!||October 29, 2015
mturnbull||50||Love this place. A bit pricy but lovely food. Well worth a visit. Try some samples and spend spend spend. Never seen so many different types of mushrooms ha ha||October 29, 2015
charlottemH1147IN||50||A great place to go and munch the afternoon away! Lots of variation in cuisines and types of food. Also good for a general mooching. Thoroughly enjoyed. ||October 29, 2015
Gadd3||40||An atmospheric food market with a wide variety of stalls. Mushroom and rabbit pâté or traditional fish and chips, whatever you are looking for you can find it here. Many of the stalls and shops offer free trials of their products. Highly recommended for food lovers!||October 28, 2015
Collin C||40||Had a really good time when visiting the market. We may have chosen a bad time of year (October) as much of it wasn't open, but what we were able to experience was excellent.||October 28, 2015
PipVickery||50||We first went a couple but this time took our 10 and 9 year olds. They loved looking at all the different foods and trying some of the tasters. There are so many different varieties of food and drink to try and buy that you could spend all day there. Easily accesible toilets at the venue too.||October 28, 2015
MinnesotaRobin||50||I thought the market in Florence Italy was spectacular and regretted visiting only once. So having enjoyed the tastes, flavors and amazing variety in the Borough Market today I'll be headed back for lunch on my last day in London.Food from all over the world to try. I particularly like the small items priced about £3 so you're not filled up and unable to try something else. Argentine wrap with cheese and carmelized onion, many cheese makers, fresh oysters, breads. Also it's conveniently located near the London Bridge station so access is easy.||October 28, 2015
billy_boy1001||50||Borough Market is London’s most renowned food market and a source of exceptional British and international produce. This place is a haven for anybody who cares about the quality and source of the food they eat. It’s not just the quality of the food on offer that makes Borough Market special it is also about the people and the place itself. The market has a rich history spanning a thousand years (there is a tour available) and with all it’s traders and aromas and vibrant colours it really is a special place. There is so much to see and to taste – so visit on an empty stomach! If you’re in the London Bridge area you should make time to visit.||October 28, 2015
Janneke B||50||As expected this market is crazy busy! Nevertheless we loved it, all the smells and noises are a real joy for everyone who loves food. And is all looks incredible. It is a market for every budget, you can go real cheap, and go for the luxury food like truffels. If we are back in London again we will visit. And the pork belly sandwich from roast is a recommendation! ||October 28, 2015
reicao||40||Have been here twice for lunch whilst exploring the city. It is very central to other attractions and has a wide variety of delicious foods ranging from vegetarian Indian to roasts. You can go during the week (less stalls but still good) or in the weekend when there is a lot more to see. There is also a lot of nice bakery stalls and others with cheeses, meats etc to take home. Recommend visiting when hungry! ||October 28, 2015
Tonycpfc1||50||Plenty of hassle and bustle going on .it was obviously very busy being half term . So many things going on plenty to taste as well the food stalls are awesome. ||October 28, 2015
229markj||40||Came here following a recommendation from a foodie friend, and was pleased we did. Visited on a Monday lunchtime, so wasn't surprised that some stalls/stores were closed, particularly on the Jubilee Place side, but still plenty to see and sample in the Green Market area. As you'd expect for any decent food market there are a wide range of international cuisines catered for including some I'd never tried before including Egyptian. This is in addition to numerous stalls selling artisan breads, charcuterie, cakes, chocolates and fudge etc.The queues for some stalls were quite long, but it was almost lunchtime. However, the longest queues were for the toilets, so be prepared to wait if busy. After browsing most of the street food stalls I headed back to the stall for Scotchtails for their runny scotch eggs with sweet potato fries for £7 (recommended by a friend), which were very tasty. My wife and I were fortunate to find a couple of chairs, as seating here is limited.This is a nice food only market to visit, well worth adding to your itinerary if spending the day in South London.||October 27, 2015
thedopefiend||50||Out of all the weekend markets I've been to around the world this is definitely up there with the very best ones. Quality and variety of the offerings, as well as the overall atmosphere was just unbelievable||October 27, 2015
Maddie W||50||It was everything that we expected and more. Lots of food from all around the world (and everything was delicious)! ||October 27, 2015
The_Cheshireset133||50||We visited mid week with the family and were very impressed. The choice of food and variety was brilliant. It does feel a bit like London's beat kept secret. A must visit venue. ||October 27, 2015
rbkburke||50||This is a really great way to spend an afternoon. We went for the lunchtime rush on a Monday and the atmosphere was just fantastic. Lots of wonderful food to choose from, amazing smells of cooking and coffee, mountains of fresh produce at the vegetable stalls, a really nice vibe to the place overall and of course endless people watching!||October 27, 2015
DoctorVonCueBall||30||Well having been to many markets like Pike in Seattle, Reading Terminal in Philly, Viktalenmarkt in Munich, Fanueil Hall in Boston, and other City markets this one is interesting but in my opinion average and way overpriced.I would say for London this is their version of the best in the world but comparing to the aforementioned others I can take it or leave it frankly. A place to kill time, people watch but keep your wallet in your pocket.Oh yeh it is cash only no CCs accepted.the Doctor||October 27, 2015
Lucy V||40||Best visited before 11.00 to avoid too many crowds.Really interesting food stalls, from cheese to organic veg to home made pies!If the weather is good, lunch at the stalls too.||October 26, 2015
349lynnr||50||Amazing pie and mash. Moo and blue purchased and steak and kidney, both with mash and gravy.... £11 for an amazing lunch and friendly service. Please can you arrange a seating area, only fault! Lovely friendly service from guys on Turkish Delight / coated raisins stall. Noodles with chicken were really nice. Great market experience, family friendly and not too pushy. Thanks x ||October 26, 2015
Timotraveler||40||We walked across the Tower Bridge to the south bank and the market was not too far from there. It is pretty interesting with a lot of small food booths and small cafes with some pretty interesting food to buy and eat. It is very colorful and some great photo opportunities. Go there toward lunch or afternoon, some of the places do not seem to open early - you should check because there are some special events and plan to go then - but if there are not it is ok to check out anyway.||October 26, 2015
anneh605||40||An excellent food market to just watch and sample dishes. Very busy around meal times, but worth a visit. Food maybe a little pricy, but enjoyed the atmosphere. ||October 26, 2015
295SD||40||If you like outdoor markets and if you can prepare food at home and if you love various kinds of food, this is a place not to miss. We went on a Saturday afternoon about 2:00-3:30. If you love crowds, a great time to go. If not, I'd recommend a week day and earlier. And if eating, look at everything before ordering, the choices are amazing. We settled for the empanadas which were fantastic but ruled out other food because the lines were so long.||October 26, 2015
PeeVeeEe||50||A little gem of a food market that will definetly give you a big smile next to anything you will eat from the specialist shops. Give it a Go!||October 26, 2015
mattw489||50||From the moment you enter Borough Market you will be hit by the fantastic sights and smells. There is so much to see and try here it worth taking your time to look around. The people at the market are usually friendly and always really knowledgable. There are some great restaurants and pubs which surround the Market which are worth a try. ||October 26, 2015
paul c||40||Got off london bridge as no trains into charing cross, so decided to have a walk ended up walking through the market, or is that trying to walk through, very very busy, but no wonder the smell of food hitting you from all direction, if going with young children keep a tight hold of them as very crowded there so much food to try, great if out for a spot of lunch, do find the prices are a bit high for a market, but sure you won't be disappointed as the food looked great and alot of vegetarian food on offer aswell and cakes, cookies, cheese, or pop into one of the many places for a drink...have fun and enjoy your surroundings and the environment.....happy eating..||October 25, 2015
sazb_80||40||We visited on a Friday lunch in October. We spent a good hour wandering round the stalls. There was a cookery demo on too. We shared a few things to eat - scotch egg and sweet potato fries, salt n pepper squid, and my favourite- a Boston burger! Queues for food were quite big, all about £6 each. Not quite the day out others have suggested! There's only so much watching food on stalls you can do when you aren't buying. This is probably somewhere to avoid on a Saturday There's only 3 toilets ||October 25, 2015
RirinCen||50||Borough Market, An awesome food-market! Lil bit pricy but fantastic quality. All types of British and international products. Great street food, great coffee, exotic meats and great value too. Perfect place to discover something new. Tips: Don't come on weekend, too crowded and long queue. Or you can come very early.||October 25, 2015
eddie100857||50||I went through this market by chance and couldn't believe the amount of food stalls, spent at least an hour there and will Deffo be going back.||October 25, 2015
Kate927||30||I love the idea of Borough Market, and the food I have eaten has been delicious, although ridiculously over priced. However it's so very busy that it's absolutely impossible to browse whats there. When you eventually get food people are so rude that half of it ends up on the floor. I don't really think there's much that can be done to improve on this point, but I'd honestly say its much easier to get food somewhere where you can actually sit and eat it, rather than whilst being continually shoved and pushed.||October 25, 2015
CG101010||40||A great market for all things to do with food - fresh produce, speciality ingredients, and also take away hot and cold food. This market is at its height on Fridays and Saturdays. It can be incredibly busy at lunchtimes on these days and some stalls are very popular, so you may need to queue. The market is particularly lively and interesting in the run up to Christmas.If you buy food to take away, it is a short walk to the River Thames, where you can enjoy the view. People also sit in the churchyard of Southwark Cathedral, next to the market.||October 25, 2015
Nicky C||40||We briefly wandered through this packed market having already eaten lunch- what a mistake !! There are dishes from all over the world on display, and the cornucopia of smells as we moved around the different stalls was amazing. It is fantastic to see the food being prepared and cooked in front of your eyes, and there were queues everywhere depending on peoples individual taste. Noisy, busy, exotic... next time we will visit when we are hungry!||October 25, 2015
NorthumberlandNomad||50||Foodie heaven, the artisan delights within the market simply made for a choice overkill experience. Having to make a decision as to what to but, taste and eat was a nightmare as all the stalls offered high class, tasty options. Definitely will be back ||October 25, 2015
Niknboo||50||Visit on an empty stomach as you can quite easily eat and drink your way round this market. Its spotlessly clean and the amazing variety of different stalls is breath taking!! Look out for the fish and cheese stalls.||October 25, 2015
Kmtift||30||Good food but really just an outdoor food court. Many different food options but unfortunately not much seating. Much ado about food...||October 24, 2015
787emmam||50||After hearing many good things from colleagues, I decided to give this market a try and was not disappointed.There are a large variety of stalls, with hot food from around the world on offer. There were also many produce stalls, with the fresh fruit and vegetable stalls looking particularly fresh and appealing. There was food to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. I had a scotch egg with sweet potato fries. Both were absolutely gorgeous. I will most certainly be back to try more!||October 24, 2015
IanAinsworth||50||A very enjoyable visit to the market. Lots of different food stalls available from local dishes to far east cuisine etc.Well worth the visit and also good for buying gifts.||October 24, 2015
chantimi||50||I travel around the world and I always enjoy visiting food markets. Ohmicho market in Kanazawa, Japan, Tsukiji in Tokyo, Nishiki Market in Kyoto, Kuromon Market in Osaka, Condamine market in Monaco, Paris can boast its fantastic Marche here and there, Frankfurt has Kleinmarkthalle and this list can go on. I visited Borough Market for the first time in September and I totally enjoyed my trip. If you are a foodie or a food blogger, you can spend DAYS here in this market. It is crowded here, better to visit here as soon as the market opens.||October 24, 2015
DoubleC2011||50||Whether you are from here or a visitor this is a must. Make sure you do it on a Friday or Saturday so you can enjoy the crowds, Friday is busy and Saturday is just manic. We always start our regular Saturday visit by going straight to Cartwright Wines in the centre of the Market where we get our prosseco to help us fight the crowds. It features some of the best veggies, cheeses, meats and olives in the world but reality is it is an experience everyone should try. Then while you are there you can pop in to the Southwark Catherdral across the street which is free and amazing as well.||October 24, 2015
Kyaku||40||We spent a very happy couple of hours here over a Saturday lunchtime. Even though it was absolutely packed with people, we managed to get round most of the market stalls. There were some locals shopping for fresh food at the attractively set out fish, meat, vegetable and bread stalls, but there were also throngs of tourists who seemed more keen on photographing food rather than buying it. Despite that, the stall holders all seemed cheerful, enthusiastic, helpful and knowledgeable, encouraging us to sample before purchasing. We had a delicious, fresh, hot pulled pork and kimchi baguette from a stall for lunch, followed by a cold beer and a welcome sit down at one of the many handy bars around the periphery of the market. I bought some great specialist cooking ingredients too.||October 23, 2015
Lionel L||40||Had a good time at the Borough Market. There's a nice coffee place called Monmouth nearby which is a great place to start. We had the famous Brindisa Chorizo sandwich which was very tasty. Also had oysters had Richard Haward and a duck confit sandwich which were decent. Less mentioned in reviews which we really enjoyed was the pasta at La Tua pasta. Lots to eat and a nice place to stroll around. ||October 23, 2015
Carlabnk123||50||Awesome variety of foods, come hungry and try items from around the world. After having some bison burgers in one of the stands we sat in a lovely wine place to drink relax. After that we stopped at other stands to get cheese, fruits and desserts for a later snack. We had a great time. ||October 23, 2015
timjoe333||50||If you are ever near London Bridge, then a visit to Borough Market is a must. There is food on sale from all four corners of the globe & also food to eat on the spot.Too difficult to highlight any particular part of the market, just go & enjoy it for yourself. It is also very close to The Shard too.||October 23, 2015
ParcyWiltshire||50||There are loads of different foods to try, both to eat there and to take home. It does get crowded on a Saturday but the stall holders organise little queues so no stress if you don't mind a bit of a wait.....well this is Britain! There are some sit down places to eat if you would prefer.||October 22, 2015
Hillburyboy||40||Borough Market has a huge areay of stalls offering artisan food from around the world. There's a great bakery, Bread Ahead, which runs courses. Several restaurants provide seating, and many stalls offer street food. If you're looking for ingredients for a particular recipe, you'll find top class meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, cheese and more. If you're more adventurous and take your cooking inspiration from seasonal produce, Borough Market is a great place to get inspired.||October 22, 2015
vittalyte||50||Actually my favourite market and one of the favourite places in London.. always tryin' to visit it while being in London. Easy to find, easy to reach via public transport. You can feel a good mood and atmosphere just in the air here! All the smells of fresh cheeses, meats, vegetables, cookies, sweets and spices and many other stuff - just caughting the nose and eyes to taste everything and decide to buy :D many people comes here to have a lunch - there are many options to have a perfect&delicious meal for that! You can choose from pork to beef, from falafel to tasty bagel sandwich! By the way, seems that prices becomes higher and higher due to popularity of this place :)Also amazing at X-mas time - many handcrafted stuff you can find here||October 22, 2015
guym862019||50||Having only heard good things about Borough Market I decided to go and see for myself and was astounded.The food market caters for those who want to try something different (Ethopian curry for example) or more standard European or American fare. If confectionary or cheeses are more your thing, you'll not be disappointed either. Only a short, 3-5 minute walk from London Bridge tube station.It will get REALLY busy on a saturday. Makes me wish I lived closer to London.||October 21, 2015
Crashman B||40||We have been here a lot of times, and it is always fun. Saturday is the best day, as all the stalls are open, but you have to get there very early. Great people watching. Saturday lunchtime is crazy crowded, so plan accordingly. Make sure to go early, get a coffee, walk around, eat samples, then hit the Cheese Man. Get one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches in the world, or his raclettes. Those are potatoes with melted cheese and gherkins. If you are there late, vendors will make you some swinging deals to unload their goods. Pastries and breads can be half price or less. Don't forget to hit Neal's Dairy around the corner, if you want to be amazed in a virtual world of cheese.||October 21, 2015
Alberta83||50||This place is great! Full of unique and delicious things - everything from cured meat, cheese, bread and pastries to wine, freshly caught seafood and game to exotic meats like ostrich, zebra and crocodile. Fun way to spend an hour or two. Also has lots of delicious and affordable food vendors. ||October 21, 2015
Anne M||50||This is an amazing place so many different types of food.Ingredients to buy or buy some lovely eat on the go foods all prepared as You wait. Would recommend it for foodies and non foodies.it's a multicultural food haven !||October 21, 2015
places2seeplaces2go||50||We visit London fairly frequently and were looking for something different this time. Wow, so pleased we thought of Borough Market. It is so interesting. Full of speciality foods, wines etc...., In fact anything food related. Plenty of foods to try/sample. Perfect place to stop for lunch. Really vibrant & fun. ||October 21, 2015
Philippa0793||50||Top end foods from all around the world to be tasted, bought and eaten for lunch. So much to choose from, you could spend hours here eating your way around. Can get very busy! ||October 21, 2015

Lisasummer||50||Visit this market at least twice a month, amazing food stalls, perfect for lunch & lots of choice - I am a vegetarian & never stuck. Would highly recommend especially on a Saturday lunch! ||October 20, 2015
lisC_al||40||love the market. we come back every time we are in london. its very near to London bridge station so very easy access. They have a variety of interesting street food and it's always buzzing with life. you can also pick up some cheese, fruits and vegetables while you are there. ||October 19, 2015
scott m||50||i visited these markets and i must say there is some fine looking and interesting food for sale here. meats, cheeses, breads and such, my nephew in law and i indulged in our love of salami's and meats, my partner and her brother and his daughter indulged in a spot of cheese tasting.i did find one shop that sold things like kangaroo, crocodile, ostrich etc to be the real eye opener, i didn't try the zebra burgers unfortunately.there are a selection of cafe's surrounding it that also have good food. i thoroughly recommend it to anyone foodie and non foodie.||October 19, 2015
BarPerz||50||Borough Market is an incredible place to visit for a work lunch or to pickup provisions to have later.A vast array of food stalls makes it difficult to decide exactly what to eat! There are a lot of butchers, fruit and vegetable, wine/beer and speciality stalls to find special ingredients to take home. Monmouth Coffee just outside the market completes the experience.I am lucky to be working within walking distance of Borough Market and will be visiting at least once each week.||October 19, 2015
EmilyC544||50||Your senses will truly be awake walking through this market. You're torn between the beautiful falafel wraps, juicy pies, sizzling hotdogs, halloumi burgers, veggie curries, brownies, fudge, cakes, bread, sweets, cider, cheese, veg *takes a deep breath* oh the list goes on. What do I eat? !I want it all! Great stop for grabbing a delicious bite to eat, hanging out with friends, or doing your gourmet food shop. Culturally interesting and an absolute dream for any foodie! ||October 19, 2015
dkshun||50||The market is super easy to get to and the food is delicious. Most of the places have samples, so you can just wander around tasting everything before you decide what to buy. An interesting mixture of different foods, all of which seems to be of great quality.||October 19, 2015
DrVicarious||50||It's not the biggest attraction in London, but if you're in the area, visit it. There are open air stalls, and plenty of new foods to try. It is near the Thames, and the walkway along the Thames, making it possible to get food, and enjoy the fresh air as well.||October 19, 2015
CTMackem||50||A great place for both foodies and non foodies and is even suitable for families. Choose from traditional artisanal food to take away or to eat on there and then. Look for the things to do before you die.||October 19, 2015
stellsa||50||I first stumbled across this place a month ago after a work do, and was pleased to be able to plan a return in October. I can't believe that I have been missing out on this place all my life! There is so much to choose from both in terms of cooked food and fresh produce. There is a great shop, Utobeer, which sells beers from across the world (a great selection of German and American beers), more cheese than you could shake a stick at, plus fresh fruit and veg, fish caught daily, meat, olives, truffles.... There is also a large area at the back of the market selling all kinds of cooked foods - pie and mash, paella, an abundance of salt beef, fish and chips.. you name it, it will be there!Make sure you take your wallet and a carrier bag or 10.. there is no way you could leave here empty handed!Super close to London Bridge tube to - Literally a two minute walk.||October 19, 2015
mcsc-squared||50||Lots of little stalls selling cheese, food, fruits, veggies, wines, knock-knacks, etc. you could easily spend a full day here and not know it. Crowded. Has a buzz. Very interesting place to people watch!||October 19, 2015
adelaideguy99||50||We enjoyed our visit here, for lunch and coffee. Had a great confit duck roll, a very tasty venison burger and a great iced coffee from the coffee shop near the front entrance. Lots of local cheeses, olives, bread and meats to taste, and then buy. Fresh and local. A great market. Very pleasant stall holders. ||October 19, 2015
apos2lisg||50||An amazing place to visit and a must go if you have the time. Small shops offering a wide range of food from from humble fish and chips to snake meat. Access is easy through the underground. ||October 19, 2015
peachyknick||50||Your senses will be overwhelmed as soon as you step into the market place. Foods of every texture, taste, country of origin are lined up waiting to be explored in this mouth watering gastronomic extravaganza. My first visit I walked about aghast at all the stalls, sampling as I went (it's ok, it's the thing to do)! ||October 18, 2015
Mark W||40||There's so much to choose from (freshly cooked food) it's difficult to make a decision but when you do, wow, taste sensation!||October 18, 2015
LaDoppiaEsse||40||This international food market is very beautiful as really expensive. Personally we had lunch at the German place (hot dog £4,5, it was I think the less expensive). You'll find cuisine for all mouths! Note during weekend is exceptionally crowded.||October 18, 2015
Paul W||40||We strolled there from Waterloo, arriving at about 2pm on a warm and dry Saturday. It was very busy, its quite clearly on the world map because most people were tourists taking photos!I would recommend diving into a pub or somewhere for a toilet stop before you get there, because the toilet queue was long!We found a lovely cider stall (New Forest Cider Stall) and we both enjoyed an amazing large warmed spiced cider. Deffo do it!We walked around, and most stalls are either Meat, Olives, Cheese, Bakery or booze. It was therefore perfect for a slow amble around whilst eating spicy sausage, olive and rosemary cheese sticks and a lovely big slice of French Comte cheese. When we left, we walked to a nearby Slug and Lettuce for a drink, but it was incredibly expensive (£9.20 for 2 pints!!)Plus side....we did see Dawn French getting into a taxi outside....celeb spotting yay! ||October 18, 2015
Stan W||50||We came out of the Shard and stumbled upon Borough market,this place is fantastic!!!if you go make sure you are hungry||October 17, 2015
timsulli||50||A great collection of food stands that run the range of tastes and better prices than the restaurants.Tie it into meal time during your daily touring for a great a tasting and realatively inexpensive meal. Walk around and see all the choices before eating at the first thing you see. You won't be disappointed!||October 17, 2015
sharonleesm||50||If you are planning a trip to Borough Market, remember to come with an empty stomach! This is more of a food market. I like the international section where you can purchase food from all over the world, german sausages, thai phad thai etc.||October 17, 2015
alana2219||50||We travelled to London in October and while staying there visited the Borough Markets. Fabulous for getting a bite to eat or sampling all the wares on display - cheeses,breads, ice cream, seafood,fruit,pies - all excellent quality - makes my mouth water thinking about them!. We ate at Applebees where the fresh seafood was very very good. ||October 17, 2015
Paparelli||50||One of the best food markets in London. Make sure you stop off for a Boston Sausage Sandwich or Boston Burger. Also the place for cheese, salami, organic goods, Turkish Delight and other fine foods. But try the Boston Sausages (you can even buy them to cook at home) - out of this world. Plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby too.||October 16, 2015
hillyPoole_Dorset||50||Borough Market is located in Southwark, when staying in London we like to walk along the embankment to visit. The London skyline is fascinating with its blend of old and new.You also get a great view of the Shard from borough market.I like to browse, the range of produce and goods available is mouthwatering.This is an ideal place to buy Christmas presents for loved ones or friends who enjoy cooking.Do not delay visit Borough Market and be amazed.||October 16, 2015
Linny105||50||I wanted to visit this market on previous trips to London but never seemed to find the time. I am so glad I did on my most recent trip. This is the most amazing place - a feast for the eyes of a food-lover ! Delicious foods of all sorts including the best fudge I have ever tasted. A visit to Borough Market should not be missed.||October 16, 2015
zenograff||50||Everytime i am in London, i make it a point to spend some time at Borough Market.This time, i met up with my friend and her son for a quick Saturday brunch This collective of artisan foodstuff and wares is amazing.just across from the entrance of the London Bridge tube stop (Jubilee Line/Northern Line)(borough market exit)would highly recommend this place.||October 16, 2015
placesthatspeak||40||Seeing the various vendors in one spot was great to see. Cheese and vegetable/fruit displays, as well as fish displays are wonderful. Many food stalls in the market. An interesting slice of London.||October 16, 2015
Barbara S||30||I used to shop here for my weekend provisions when I lived in central London 12 years ago. I could not believe how tarted up the market was, how enclosed the stalls were, and how the prices have climbed! If you do buy food to eat on the hoof, you are just jostled around, difficult to find some place to eat your finds. The market is mainly for tourists now, not really that practical for local shoppers anymore - what a shame.||October 15, 2015
Jerry M||50||We stumbled upon this local market while walking to the globe theatre. We found an amazing farmers market with foods, cheeses, meats and produce from all over the world. There where many specialty vendors selling all kinds of delicacies.It was definitely amazing to walk through the booths smelling the fresh foods and flowers and awesome. The sangrias where great, the paellas smelled amazing. I recommend the stuffed truffle raviolis. Definitely wish i could have brought some back with me.Definitely worth a visit and just have lunch here. Its worth it.||October 15, 2015
Chris M||40||I am a regular attendee at Borough market, as I never tire of wandering around the stalls, chatting to the friendly vendors and sampling the vast array of cheeses, fruits and preserves available. Yes, it does get a little busy at times, however that all adds to the bustling atmosphere. It's a great place to grab a bite before a romantic stroll along the Southbank.||October 15, 2015
mvwijland||50||Borough market just doubled the marketplace. It's the place to go for food. Here you will find greengrocer and butchers with the best products possible. There are many food stands for a wonderful lunch. And there are special places, like Brindisa, where you can buy many Spanish products, cheese and the best olive oil. Borough market is a must see for tourists and a great place to shop for quality ingredients.||October 15, 2015
Carol H||40||I have made a number of Saturday visits here and thoroughly enjoyed it. This time I visited on a Friday and fond it much more enjoyable - less crush, shoppers more relaxed. I like to buy a selection of food for a picnic. There is a shortage of places to at but then its only a short walk to the river where there are plenty of places to picnic. Its very easy to reach via the tube and a good place to start out on a exploration of the nearby little galleries and shops on Bermondsey Street.||October 14, 2015
JK_ontheroad1||50||This market is alive with people everyday of the week. From fresh foods (zebra & camel is available). The prepared food ranges from India, Spanish, Baked Goods to sweets. If I lived in London I wood shop here often. Well worth the visit.||October 14, 2015
MaryBethJ_65||50||A friend recommended I head to Borough Market and it was so worth the effort! The food options are not only extremely varied, they are of high quality and delicious! You can get so many different ethnic foods to eat right at the market, take them to go, or buy others (pasta, meat, etc) to take home. You can also find great gifts here for anyone who appreciates artisan food. Just walking around the market was a treat, the food was an added bonus!||October 14, 2015
Lag66||50||We came to Borough Hall around lunchtime on a Tuesday and were worried because it wasn't the weekend, but the market was full of stalls selling food, wine, and cheese. We had an amazing curry from a stand with gigantic frying pans, a watermelon juice from a place selling fresh fruit juices, and picked up some pastries from a bakery stand. I'm still thinking about that curry.||October 14, 2015
Andyonhishols||50||Go there hungry, ready to try new things and prepared to buy a few edible luxuries. We wanted down there for brunch on a Sunday. Absolutely heaving but great atmosphere and the food was great. Cheese, cheese, cheese, fantastic ethnic and international take-away stalls, wine, more cheese, cakes, vegetables, fish and some cheese. Great place to browse and no doubt cool locals do their weekly shop here but for most it's a chance to buy stuff you normally wouldn't.||October 14, 2015
CARose||50||Don't miss the opportunity to hit the Borough Market. Make sure you go on the right days - Wednesday and Saturday most of the year. If you're a foodie, this is the right place for you. On entering, surrounded by endless stalls of preparing and selling food of all kinds, also you will find lots of local products, handmade goods, artisan bread and cakes. It goes on and on. You will be so conflicted what to eat, just try what you want. There are also lots of places to have some drinks - wine, prosecco etc. Allow yourself plenty of time to explore and take in all the culinary delights!||October 14, 2015
Aimee S||50||Loads of fantastic stalls with a massive variety of foods to eat there and take home! Great breakfast at Maria's, lovely macaroons, delicious chocolate tart, raw honey and yummy smoothies!||October 14, 2015
SarahP850||40||This market is mainly about food. You could graze your way through the place trying out delicious morsels of cheese, meat, bread, biscuits, olives etc. Also a great place to have lunch from one of the many stalls serving hot food. Always worth a visit if you are in the area. ||October 14, 2015
jano963||40||We had a great day at Borough Markets meeting up with old friends for lunch and soaking up the vibe. A wonderful spot to visit and easy access via London Bridge tube.||October 14, 2015
59travel59||50||Really brilliant food market with so much to look at. Wish I lived locally so that I could use this as my local market as the prices were reasonable but still enjoyed it as a tourist. Very busy on Saturday but this didn't detract. Ate at Fish! which was excellent but have also enjoyed a pulled duck confit brioche standing around chatting.||October 14, 2015
LadyViolet1986||40||This is a super-hipster foodie market under London Bridge. They have everything from exotic salts (I am a sucker for exotic salt!) to meat to fresh figs to black truffle oil. And the best coffee I have had in the UK. Great place to visit if you like food.||October 13, 2015
Mitchellfamily7||40||Was recommend to visit by a friend but was initially put off as we hate markets. After reading TA reviews thought it must be worth a visit. What a tragedy it would have been if we had decided not to visit! Its awesome. Its free to enter, crazy manic crowds but such an atmosphere. We could have spent all day here mooching about. You really need to be going home with your goods on the day of your visit so for us it was difficult to buy much as we had 2 nights in London and no cool bag to stash stuff. Free tasters going on everywhere, cheap prosecco to sip on as you walk around and an abundance of lunch choices. The foods on sale are wonderful - a lot of exotic fruit and vegetables that you probably only find here for some of those extravagant recipes. We will definitely visit again but ensure we come with a list of wild ingredients to buy and then go home and cook!!!||October 13, 2015
NYCBizTraveler24||50||Go early on Saturday morning because the market becomes a teeming mass of humanity after 11 - for good reason! Stalls of lovely produce, mushrooms, meat; stands of perfect duck confit sandwiches, toasted cheese, sparkling wine beverages. Great for both foodies and people watchers!||October 13, 2015
Darling1115||40||We went on a Wednesday afternoon and we got to eat some very good food! The scotch eggs at Scotch Tails were very good. The chorizo roll at Brindisa was also great. The sausage on a stick at Boston sausage was also very tasty. I definitely recommend stopping by here for lunch. It is directly under the Southwark Cathedral.||October 13, 2015
Petecwilson||50||For some reason we kept making the tube stop to tower bridge. Of course because right across the street is foodie heaven. Especially between Thursday to Saturday when all the stalls are all full. Richard Howard's oysters are possibly the best and certainly freshest I have ever had, delish. Meat pies galore, curry, panninis, paella, and fresh bread and chocolate to die for. Charcuterie, cheeses, jams, fruit, meat, fish, and veggies all so goodSay hello to Armando Ortiz at the market information office he was wonderfully helpful||October 12, 2015
CAnativewanderlust||40||Like much of London and the UK, much history here. We took the tube which dropped us across the street. Also easy access to the Shard. We went during the week when most stalls are open. This is a great market for locals for fresh breads, produce, meats but also a great place for tourists to meander and grab a bite. We tried several food items (fresh bread, pasta) and we're huge on Italian food and breads but we always find the English spin tends to be a bit bland so the food we had was very good but not the best we've had. I give the disclaimer we're big on spicy and flavorful which is not to everyone's liking either. I would say I have had better bread from our local island bakery and better in France itself and better Italian in London and Italy. We spent a few hours here and enjoyed our visit, we did research in advance to understand the history. For those on the west coast of the US, this might be likened to Pike Place in Seattle (in my opinion much tastier food options and amazing florals and crafts) or Farmer's Market in Los Angeles (the food and produce stalls, not all the souvenir shacks).||October 12, 2015
ShaunF429||40||What an awesome market!! The types of food ie cheeses, cold meats, Truffles wine etc.Wow everything for everybody, but a lack of seating makes a picnic a bit difficult.||October 12, 2015
Garry K||50||Great market. Ideal place to sample food and immerse yourself into the atmosphere of an old market. Easy acces from London Bridge. ||October 12, 2015
TripInsider||50||After crossing Millennium Bridge, visiting Tate Modern and St. Paul's, on a rainy Monday, we rewarded ourselves at Borough Market! First treat was a carrot, ginger, apple juice at a fruiterer's stall. Next decision was lunch! We did not wander far to find a diver's scallop stir fry served on a shell and a venison burger (about 6 pounds each, prepared before your eyes!).....then, despite the rainfall, we headed outside to the temporary stalls offering a variety of international street foods! Could not resist the German brat mit kraut.(about 4 pounds 50)...better than the christmas market staple, probably because we weren't freezing! Desserts and sweet treats were plentiful and good. Rum-raisin fudge, by the piece, was buttery good, as was the giant dark chocolate chip cookie from the french baker's stand. Thai coconut pancakes anyone? Argentinian or Balkan street treats? Donuts? Cheesecake? Yummm bread! Cheeses? Paella? Curry? A musician played ,crowd was manageable, probably due to rainy Monday! Great day to view all the stalls and look over-and smell- all the products. So much easier to do this leisurely stroll on a rainy Monday than a busy Saturday morning! Note that a few of the stalls were closed on Monday, but still many good spots to visit! Bring pounds and wet ones; street food is impossible to resist-and messy!||October 12, 2015
Brian C||40||Visited this with family and the choice of street food is excellent? There are stalls selling many varieties of sausage, burger, shredded/pulled meats, steaks with salad, salad, pies hot or cold, fresh fruit, cheeses, quite a street food gourmet delight. ||October 12, 2015
ijdickson||50||Popped in after breakfast to find this amazing market with superb stalls, very friendly staff. The visual impact on the stalls are awesome, colourful and very appealing. The products on sale and quality are superb. Must visit this market.||October 12, 2015
andyccpc||40||Borough Market is fascinating. What a splendid array of fresh and unusual produce beautifully displayed in an extremely vibrant atmosphere. We visited the market after a trip to the Shard and how I wish it was on my doorstep at home. This is a must do experience if markets are your thing - we love them!||October 12, 2015
kellid338||50||Beautifully diplayed and presented food from folks who care. Cheeses, fruit and veg, sweets, pastries and so much more! A food photog's dream. We sampled our way through and were almost too full to feast on the stunning spit roasted pig...Almost. One of the mosst delicious walks I've ever taken.||October 11, 2015
Zoey Clare M||50||On a friends suggestion, my partner and I visited the markets and loved it. We arrived early morning and so there were not too many people about. We found all the stall holders to be very friendly and knowledgeable about the products. They were very keen for us to sample products without any obligation to buy. We had a great time sampling food and drinks, and found the markets to be varied with many exotic foods. A must do for foodies! Only lowlight was there were not many places to sit for lunch but this didn't dampen our experience.||October 11, 2015
MV1961||40||The market has a lovely buzz about it with a great selection of foods, the smells as you wander around are lovely. We went on a Saturday morning and by midday you could hardly move, it was heaving. Prices are not cheap, but there are many specialist suppliers offering high quality produce. There are also many stalls to buy freshly cooked food, there are almost too many to choose from, the queues at some were pretty big, ||October 11, 2015
Aldhelm||50||As an ex-north of the river londoner I didn't know this place existed until 3 years ago. Yes full of tourists but great atmosphere. At lunchtime so much fast food. Some speciality foodie greengrocers, fishmongers , butchers etc. Not really like a continental market where real people buy their dinner but great fun. Plenty of places to eat & drink.I have not seen anything quite like it in the UK. A big hit with Mrs Aldhelm as well.||October 11, 2015
Zanna94||50||This was one of the highlights of my London trip. This is the perfect place to just browse and explore different types of produce and cuisine. Note that it is easy to be a little overwhelmed if it's your first time here, and your eyes will be too big for your stomach. I ended up trying to taste as much as I could. I had a prawn fritter from a Peruvian stall, a Beef Empanada from an Argentinean place, a juice from one of the produce vendors, and noodles from Wok It. Wok it is a fantastic noodle place. I'd happily go back again.Here's a tip: If you can, go during a weekday when there are less crowds. I went on a Wednesday, which was just perfect!||October 11, 2015
Rocksy75||50||Make a point to get there, especially around lunch time. So much top quality fresh food available. If you want to eat for free, just wander around trying the samples. If you do that for an hour you will not leave hungry!!||October 11, 2015
jdmiller83||50||I've enjoyed each and every visit I've made to Borough Market. Catch it at its most bustling on a Saturday morning, or visit at around 10-11 during the week for a less hectic trip. There are some outstanding flavours and treats here no matter what your preference or persuasion. Sweets, cooked meats, cold meats, cheese, fruit, vegetables and a wide selection of international snacks are available. My favourite here is surely the Chorizo roll, and my wife enjoyed a Duck confit roll. For those with a sweet tooth, you'll be spoilt by the range including meringues, baked goods and turkish delight. If you enjoy your food and are visiting London, make some time for Borough Market.||October 11, 2015
bitt21||50||I have visited a couple of times and enjoyed both visits. Some of the products are quite inexpensive , for example figs on this visit were 40p, cheaper than Waitrose however, this could not be said of everything. A very pleasant way to while away an hour or 2||October 10, 2015
mccdzyne||40||Visited the much talked about Borough markets yesterday. What a wonderful market , easily rivals Les Halles De Lyon. The semi open layout creates a great atmosphere. Much like the Lyon market , the Borough sells everything to do woth food and all of a good quality, the other thing that was good and unlike Lyon , most of the vendors have sampling plates do you try before you buy. Great way to spend a morning browsing, did stop for some fresh shucked oysters , a chorizo roll and a jam donut. Many different lunch options, to many to choose from. Bought some cheese,olives, ciabatta and a wild boar sausage roll. Do yourself a favour and visit the Borough markets - Bon appetite. ||October 10, 2015
AnneKoala||50||Be prepared for the crowds! But they are there for a reason. The food is fabulous and the atmosphere friendly and enthusiastic. There's a huge selection of gourmet delights awaiting. ||October 10, 2015
Carol C||50||A wonderful place to eat and drink...with fresh vegetables nd fruits! All types of Meat, cheese and breads...very rich!||October 10, 2015
andyharrison30||50||I've been to Borough Market numerous times and absolutely love it. The food is amazing, there is a huge selection to chose from in terms of sweet and savoury as well as different cuisines. The food market is wonderful and some of the ingredients you can find here are amazing such as Ostrich eggs. Never have I left and felt disappointed even when it is overrun with people! I can't wait to visit again when I return to London next year.||October 9, 2015
SMO2015||50||I have only gotten around to completing this review now of my visit last Dec, but this is an attraction worth writing home about! A buzzing vibrant marketplace of a dizzying variety of fresh fare and gourmet wares, coming together to make this a signature London attraction. Highly recommended to go to this marketplace hungry, and to sample multiple offerings. My husband and I sampled some amazing meat pies (photo attached), various cheeses from one of the cheese-mongers, and even some truffles. Given that we went in Dec, the Christmas decorations augmented the already festive atmosphere. For the enthusiastic foodie, worth a visit amongst the many attractions London has to offer!||October 9, 2015
tulioy16||50||This place is a foodie's dream! All kinds of things from cheeses to Greek to Indian, to salt beef. If it weren't for the other 100 billion people there as well, this would have been a 10/10. Still worth the go for sure. ||October 9, 2015
Heidi D||50||We have been to the Bourough Market many times and each time it is a real pleasure. There are foods from all over the world in a very open and pleasant setting. The prices are fair for an open market from 3-10 pounds. There is also a choice of alcohol to supplement your delicious meal. The indian food is expecialy good but we have now tested just about every vendor and they are all fantastic. It is located in an easy to get to spot near Waterloo Station, the Eye, Westminster and Jubilee Bridge. Great food and it's fun to meet people from all over the world there too.||October 9, 2015
JinxHE||50||This market is beautiful, and lively. Our only wish was we could have had access to a kitchen to enjoy cooking some of the items sold there! The cheese stalls are amazing, as was the produce displayed. We sampled some wonderful sausages, breads, hams, and cheeses, and loved the chorizo sandwiches! The market is a nice departure from the normal tourist stops, and is a great stop for lunch. ||October 9, 2015
Hollypal||50||Not only did we find excellent food and plenty of it, but the stall holders were interesting, knowledgeable and willing to give you their time. With the noise of the train wheels screeching as they entered the station nearby the atmosphere was surpurb. Lots of multicultural food and people and yes plenty of tourists, but also many other locals all either eating the range of food on offer, or buying different ones to take home. We Left with some surpurb cheeses and other goods not available from your average local supermarket||October 8, 2015
Cdn72||50||Fantastic market if you want to buy some fresh food and head to a park or the waterfront. Plenty of small shops and restaurants in the area as well. Definitely would recommend the Wine Merchant for great wine, atmosphere and sharing plates. There is also a fine spirit store just down from the market where you can get spirits you would not find at home.||October 8, 2015
djw1955||50||Busy but an enjoyable visit to Borough Market. Very friendly market with many different world wide foods to see and sometime taste. Enjoy the difference world wide taste of cheeses and the cup of fresh coffee after my visit. Many foreign visitors at the market and taking photo's. Excellent morning and never a dull moment.||October 8, 2015
aliss14||50||It's worth visiting this market. Here you can find quality foods and drinks and maybe some souvenirs or flowers. It was crowded and a bit touristy but i had a good time there :)||October 8, 2015
lydshill||50||Never actually meant to visit Borough market, but we were really pleased that we stumbled upon it one day whilst out walked in London.The food markets are incredible and the smells just add to the atmosphere... just make sure you haven't eaten before visiting!!||October 7, 2015
Swati S||50||Borough Market is one of the oldest and largest open air food market in London and is an absolute delight. Every where you turn, you see a wide variety of food- savory & sweet, fruits & vegetables, cheeses, pickles, meats, chocolates, toffees and you name 'em. And what's even better are the ubiquitous signs that say organic, fair-trade, natural. If you are the kind of person who finds pleasure in visiting farmer's markets, or simply like to try a wide variety of food, Borough Market is a feast for your senses. An attraction not to be missed!||October 7, 2015
Christine D||50||EVERYTHING is tempting. The fresh food (especially the fresh bread and cheese), the lunch stalls, the pastries and cakes. I will have to go there at least once a week to try all the yummy food. The atmosphere is super friendly and nice. ||October 7, 2015
Cork3||50||Amazing variety of food from around the world. You may need to go back several times to try everything you fancy. ||October 7, 2015
sheepygold||40||Personally I would not come here as a special visit but it is great if you are walking along the South bank of the river Thames or are visiting Southwark Cathedral next door or the Globe Theatre. There is a great variety of high quality and unusual food here but it is expensive! Avoid lunchtimes when the coffee shops etc have huge queues.||October 7, 2015
fromstalbans||50||There is a great selection of unusual take away food stalls as well as cheese,charcuterie , bread, cake and vegetable stalls- enough for all tastes. It is not over-priced and is fun to nose around and choose something to eat||October 7, 2015
Eggo1||40||Great food market with lots of fresh food and snacks to choose from. Paid a fortune at the Shard for a terrible breakfast and wish we had gone here instead to try some of the delicious food on offer. Will definitely try this place again when in London.||October 7, 2015
Andy7131||40||So I've been to Borough Market countless times, but I recently visited on a Wednesday Morning/early afternoon and it reminded me why I liked it in the first place.So yeah, it's a nightmare on a Saturday and any day in the lunchtime rush...but the food is unbeatable and the location is incredible. That being said, on a Saturday I'd probably head down to Maltby St instead (although it's getting pretty busy this year too!)||October 7, 2015
Eric W||40||Borough Market is a very busy place especially during lunch hours. Getting there by tube from Leicester Square station, you have to take the Black Line to Waterloo station and then switch to Grey Line going to London Bridge Station and exit from there. From London Bridge station you can visit the famous London Bridge before walking back to the market. There are many fruits, vegetables, pastry, cheese, etc and even exotic foods like crocodile, zebra and kangaroo meat on sale. Some fruits like nectarine are also sold at a wholesale price of 6 pieces for 1 pound! I tried a cup of hot and spicy cider from a stall which tastes out of this world. After you have done your shopping here you can adjourn to Hay's Galleries and the Tower Bridge close by to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Thames River and its surroundings.||October 7, 2015
aorton||50||We have been to many markets in London and this one seems to be one of the few that is actually used many many locals. The market is great. It has cheese, baked goods, produce, meats, and cheese. A great place to pick up supplies for a picnic or better yet, there are many food vendors. The toasties are always a big hit in my family. Arrive early to avoid the crowds and avoid weekends!||October 6, 2015
Angela R||40||I love Borough Market!I loved it when I use to visit London as a student.I loved it when I use to visit when travelling to London on business....and I still love it now (although I don't go there as often as I'd like!)Anyway, I was passing through recently and was on the look-out for cake stalls.I have found the PERFECT one for me!It's called 'The Free From Bakehouse', and the delicious goodies range from wheat free to dairy free (as well as gluten etc.)I bough a piece of 'Rocky Road' and a cookie. They were scrumptious!You can check them out online, but better still, go and see for yourself! As for me? I'm popping over there tomorrow afternoon for my sweet fix! Can't wait! Yum!!||October 6, 2015
45eminea||50||A HUGE variety of food to choose from. Stalls are full of fantastic delights. Worth a visit if you're looking for something different which will most likely be delicious. Lunch time is quite busy so I'd say avoid it if you can. Also It's closed on Tuesdays. We had delicious burgers and Scotch eggs with sweet potato fries, highly recommended.||October 6, 2015
no1mumLondon||50||This is just a must go to place in London. A market has been on this site (about) for over 2000 years... history and fine food meet. A feast for the eyes. Planning a dinner party - get inspiration and the best raw product for many miles. Try different things, cheeses, pates, sauces... different cultures meet and blend. Plan to be there a long time. Go to Neal's Yard and be prepared to be educated beyond your dreams in cheese. Coffee, chocolate, seafood, meat, vegetables... whatever your culinary passion, you can satisfy it here. A trip to London is not complete without a trip to Borough Market. And don't forget to have the hog roast in a bun with stuffing from the 'hole in the wall' - look for it. It's there and just yummy!||October 5, 2015
Alan D||50||Borough Market really is all about the experience. Joining the hustle and bustle of a busy market place selling everything for food lovers from tomatoes to truffles and olives to oysters is something that you must do on a Saturday morning. The market is right outside Borough tube station and underneath London Bridge mainline station so its easy to get to and you'll be glad you made the trip. The prices are "market" not "London" and when you've finished gorging on the fare, you can relax with a glass of Champagne and re-charge the batteries before strolling on to numerous other attractions nearby including The Shard and Monument.||October 5, 2015
garyhA33ZS||50||This has to be one of our favourite places to stop by when we are in London, we always aim for the Falafel wraps, and then get sucked into the many food and general stools from around the world, this lovely little market has a magical feel to it with a buzz and vibe that will brighten up the dullest of days and bluest of moods, can't wait to visit again soon. ||October 5, 2015
Tom V||50||This is a site not to be missed. So much good food and wonderful deserts. This is a must stop place to see lots of different food vendors all in one place. ||October 5, 2015
Mandi G||50||This is a great market to come shopping for food! With a wide variety of restaurants, food stalls and produce, you can come to try different places for a meal, or come grocery shopping! There's a wide variety of prepared foods, from curry to doughnuts. It's normally very busy, especially on weekends, but it is worth fighting the crowds to get locally grown food and delicious snacks! For the most part, the market is covered, so it's a good option on a rainy day! It's very conveniently located next to the London Bridge Tube station! I'd recommend getting a doughnut from Bread Ahead and grabbing a fresh juice or smoothie from one of the many juicers!||October 5, 2015
FamilyManager||50||Apparently the oldest market in London! It's so pretty! So "old" and busy, exciting, vibrant, with a wide variety of patrons. Grab a seat in one of many cafes/bars and have a cold beer and some grub while watching the action. Fresh flowers, baked goods, meats, and prepared foods abound. The location is steeped in history, steps to The Thames and steps to London Bridge tube station. Lots to buy....lots to see....very interesting.||October 5, 2015
Rose B||50||Great selection of stalls, lovely atmosphere, and a wonderful setting for the markets. We went on a Friday which was pretty busy, so I can imagine its hell on a Saturday!||October 5, 2015
Tine C||40||If interested in food you should visit this market. Selection is great and surroundings charming. Most produce are organic. Prices are a bit high.||October 4, 2015
2Travelnuts101||40||Inside the market place had different variety of fast food and very good selections to choose from. The price of the food all were very reasonable. You could also find fresh produces, clothings, hand crafts and other miscellaneous items.||October 4, 2015
Miller_KO||50||Located close to the London Bridge station of the London underground train network and has been operating since at least 1014. The market is an iconic landmark in Southwark London, just like the shard building is (which can also be see close by) except I doubt you will get such nice food in the shard for such good prices. The market has appeared in a number of films and even music videos, but it is the food there that really stands out. This is far from a tourist dominated market, with most people (tourists and locals alike) going there for there wide selection of fresh and seasonal food. The market is a eclectic collection of independent produce sellers and food stalls selling any and everything from fruit and veg to exquisite white truffles. My advise is go at lunch or at least hungry and try everything the market has to offer, as it boast a wide array of international cuisine. It does tend to get a bit busy and you may need to queue but there were so many sights, smells and sounds to take in it is hardly notable.||October 4, 2015
Graham S||40||We went to see Borough Market when we were in London yesterday and it was a great experience. Its full of a variety of stalls where you can buy spices, cheeses, meats and loads of other different types of food and fast food stores where you can buy noodles, burgers and pies etc.. In amongst all of this is stalls selling cakes, sweets and chocolates. Augmenting this are plenty of international food stalls where you can buy and taste a global food from across the globe. If we had gone further (time was at a premium) we would probably have found stalls selling good clarets, fine wines and aged malt scotch; all the hallmarks of an urbane shoppers paradise. Put simply Borough Market is a place where you can enjoy and rejoice in the small pleasures of shopping.  you won't normally try. an interesting and enjoyable experience.||October 4, 2015
Meta888||40||Really nice food market. A lot of stalls and a wide selection of food and related products. Close to London bridge underground. ||October 4, 2015
Kilo T||50||This has to be one of the best indoor/outdoor markets in central London, and is a hive of activity all year round. Much of it is housed under railway arches, and an ornate Victoria iron and glass structure wedged in between. It consists of small independent shops and colourful stalls offering a variety of fruit and veg, plus cuisine from around the world. We visited on a warm weekday lunchtime, and the place was absolutely packed with tourists and local office workers queuing for food. The market has appeared in a number of films including Bridget Jones’s Diary, and one of the Harry Potter films. There are a number of other places of interest nearby including Southwark Cathedral, The Shard, the Clink Prison museum and of course the River Thames. Nearest station is London Bridge.||October 4, 2015
txfoodiefamily||50||This place was truly amazing! Come hungry (lots of different foods to eat there)and leave wishing you lived there and could shop for your groceries there every week. Loved it! A brilliant way to really experience the local produce, cheese/dairy, meats, etc.||October 3, 2015
Malcolm D||40||Great experience, full of vegetable stalls, fruit stalls, etc. You can buy spices, cheeses, different types of food, cakes, sweets, chocolate. There are plenty of international food stalls where you can buy and taste a global selection food you won't normally try. an interesting and enjoyable experience. ||October 3, 2015
suzeetee||50||Borough Market, one of my most favourite places in London. A must see place... Loads of food choices and great for food shopping and those harder to find ingredients you can't get in the supermarket. Alongside the ,armed are lots of traditional English pubs too. Gets very busy at the weekends, so get there early to miss the crowds. Try everything! ||October 3, 2015
LAURA E||50||Never been to this area of London before and was impressed with the 'olde worlde' charm of the market. Followed advice in timing visit with lunchtime and had a lovely burger-be careful you get in the right queue, the lengthy salt beef queue was next door. Whilst in this area, take a short walk to see the Golden Hinde ship, remains of Winchester Palace and several old pubs by the river: the Anchor and Thameside Inn.||October 3, 2015
Parkhill2||50||Go here for the best choice of street food and eclectic food outlets. Go to Maria's for Bubble & Squeak with a cup of tea. Visit Neal's Yard for the best choice of cheese in London. Food is not cheap but overall the quality is very good. Go early and avoid the crowds. Highly recommended.||October 3, 2015
Jess B||30||Quite pricey, but there was a lot of variety. I enjoyed the fresh organic veg and some bread from a bakery. It closed earlier than we expected, though, so we didn't get to see as much as I would have liked. Definitely go earlier in the day when more things are open. ||October 3, 2015
survivor5804||40||When we got there it was closing time so most places were shutting down. But it was still a nice place to visit and get some food. Definitely worth the stop for a meal. ||October 3, 2015
Mianel||50||Borough Market is a hidden gem on the South Bank. It is an original covered food market with a lot of British and international products, most of them organic. It is has the atmosphere of a South-European market. Lots of possibilities to try unknown food.||October 3, 2015
Karen G||50||I visited around noon, expecting to grab a quick lunch, maybe stroll about for a little bit, and be on my way. It turned out differently as I was amazed and surprised by the enormous amount of stalls. A very lively and colourful market in a beautiful location, this will make you want to explore until you drop. For lunch we had pie (Pie Ministry: totally worth the queue!) and some cheesecake brownies before we were stuffed, a fact I thoroughly regretted seeing as I wanted to taste so much more. Also very suitable for vegetarians. I will definitely visit again (and again and again and again).||October 2, 2015
Rhianon_aston||50||Would highly recommend stopping by the markets even if it's just for lunch. Plenty of choice and good prices. Something for everyone. ||October 2, 2015
Brendan N||50||When on vacation in London last week, I thought "its a market, i know what a tomato looks like, how good can it be?" But it really is a feast for the senses. The architecture is really cool with the train going overhead and all. The smell of the different food shops is great and the variety of foods is outstanding. This market alone can put an end to the sentiment that British food is bad. Some stuff is really pricey (just like the rest of the city) but some is reasonable.||October 2, 2015
HoneyBrown1976||40||Crowded, but well worth the visit. I ventured over with an empty stomach and curiosity. After circling the different stands, I selected some paella and fresh juice. While the juice was a bit tart, the paella was delicious. If you're hungry, there's a stand for you - sandwiches and other hot foods galore! Enjoy!||October 2, 2015
Jennym9876||50||We went to the Borough markets to have a look around as recommended. However we ended up trying so many great foods. So many cheeses, meat, vinegar and bread. I was in food heaven. I had lunch and also cheeky desert!!! Definitely worth a look and taste. Free entry!!!||October 2, 2015
John B||50||On our latest visit to the capital we visited Borough Market.Food from all cultures and from the 4 corners of the world.Very busy but very enjoyable.Be prepared to sign up for the gym or start a new diet after the visit though.It's a foody heaven....||October 2, 2015
klkh2002||50||I visited the Borough Market a while back and it was really quiet. On this visit, the place was absolutely bustling! I could not beleive the difference. It really is one of the most enjoyable markets I have been to. The food and produce stors are first class. If you love cheese, wow, there are some many different stores selling different types of cheeses. Everything is so beautifully presented. If you are intending to visit, I would suggest you got there with the intention of a meal. There are so many great options there not to mention free samples from many of the stores. If you prfer to sit down, there are a number of very good restaurants.Such a wonderful place and it is so easily accessible by the tube.||October 1, 2015
kendricks26||50||Nearest tube is London bridge. The exists from the station van be confusing at the mo with all the work going on there. However once you find the place your senses hit overdrive. Despite being veggie there was plenty to taste and try||September 30, 2015
cooker3000||40||I found this place by accident but glad I did. It's a cool market with a great location. It's well worth visiting.||September 30, 2015
Sian F||40||Always have a fantastic time at Borough Market. So many stalls with fresh food to choose from. I can never decide what to have but a favourite would be the cheese toastie stall. It is always VERY busy from lunchtime onwards on a Saturday so try and get there early to avoid this.||September 30, 2015
SimonFord||30||The thing that stands out about Borough Market is the sheer number of tourist there, most of who block everyone's path around the market by stopping to use their selfie sticks at every opportunity. If you really want to use the market rather than take pictures of it you really need to get there early and avoid it at lunchtime unless you want to use one of the many take away food stalls there.||September 30, 2015
Brian D||50||Follow you nose and you will easily find some nice food here, well organised market, clean with a lots of stuff to exploreTry to find the oyster stall at the edge of the market||September 29, 2015
Dulcedeborita||50||Just go for a nice walk to discover The Borough Market, enormous, different kind of foods, you can taste free the variety of cheese, cold cuts, and choose where to eat, there are many bars and little restaurants, many blocks with fresh fruits, vegetables, and what you want .I use to visit markets in France, this is a good one, english style, of course||September 29, 2015
Gerad B||50||This was my first visit to Borough Market but it will not be my last, in fact if I lived anywhere near it I would go very week. Fashoined amongst the original buildings and streets of a distant past there is enough archecture to keep your amused. However, the real attraction is the stalls, they are wonderous. With every turn you find something else that make you want to eat, to cook to sit and savour. A brillaint place to find something special for any occasion.||September 29, 2015
MeredithFlorida||40||This is an enormous market near Southwark Cathedral. It has everything you might want! Really fun to walk around and pick up some treats or have lunch.||September 29, 2015
angelawN6162MZ||40||Great place to bye alternative foods like goats milk ice cream, vegan cake, gluten free bread along with hot food stalls. The chese stalls sells a wide variety of cheses great place to try something new. Also a great place for specialty coffees. ||September 29, 2015
GSWilson||40||An interesting collection of food offerings in an old market site.Worth cruising and tasting and buying seldom seen foods like truffle oil, hard to find cheese and great breads.||September 28, 2015
SandeCal||50||A lovely destination after a Thames river walk in the shadow of Southwark Cathedral. Fresh veg, cheeses, and cured meats; hot food stalls and a cider vendor with fresh tapped mead that is wonderful.||September 28, 2015
Ann C||40||My daughter and I spent a happy 3 hours being guided round the market by the enthusiastic and very knowledgeable Celia Brooks. Celia has a great rapport with the traders who were generous with their time and samples of their wonderful products so no need for lunch at the end. After the tour was over, we went back to the various stalls that particularly impressed us with the fresh pasta flavoured with truffles coming top of the list. If you can avoid Saturday mornings you will have the best chance to see and try all that you fancy, but whenever you go, it will be worth the effort||September 28, 2015
Nyxed||50||We had a great time here trying food and exploring. This place is all about food and it's delicious. It's almost impossible to decide what you're going to try so I'd advise you try a little bit of everything and come hungry. Be aware that there really isn't anything other than food here, there is no seating, and it's fairly expensive.||September 28, 2015
Jim L||50||This ancient food market is well worth a visit. At Lunch time there are enough food stalls to cover the entire world of food. From Asia to the Middle East and Europe. Great food and fantastic smells.Very convenient for Tate Modern, The Globe Theatre. Southwark catherdral and the Golden Hinde II.||September 28, 2015
Morso101||50||Worth a special trip when the full market is on, try not to have breakfast as the street food stalls are all excellent. Some of the fishmongers have forks for the excellent dressed crab and stalls also do wine by the plastic glass, very civilised. Samples of produce abound so don't be afraid to ask, if you`re a foodie or a cook this is a must visit place. Try the truffle infused honey and the turkish delight stall, the sausages and the cheeses, its all here. Pack stretch pants.||September 28, 2015
CharlitaEU||40||A great find on the South bank - totally Worth a visit. Lots of nice products and good for for reasonable price - and best of all - you really feel "like a local" when wandering around here. It's not very big, so you don't need to stay long, but when walking around "touristing" in London, this is a great stop on the way for grabbing some food and "breathing" a bit. ||September 28, 2015
Rebecca H||40||If you have some free time in London you definitely should check this place out! This market is nothing glamorous but is has a lot of great food and produce stalls. You can even walk around and samples cheeses, olive oil and wines. A great place to stop for lunch while touring the city. Added bonus - it's open every day not just on weekends.||September 28, 2015
Goop2709||50||Borough Market is probably the best food market I've visited in London. It's got a wonderful array of stalls and shops, filled with freshly cooked food everywhere you walk. This place was packed on a Saturday afternoon so on our next visit, we shall choose a slightly quieter time.||September 28, 2015
plasmid||50||This is a great place to go for lunch. Close to the London Bridge underground and next to Southwark Cathedral. The food stalls will have you salivating making it very difficult to choose one. In addition, there are a number of cafes, bars, and restaurants in the area to satisfy anyone's taste. A must visit when in London.||September 27, 2015
keller1955||50||A should go! Great place: lots of different and high quality food. The place is clean, organized, colourful. The merchants are from several parts of the world. A place to buy exquisite items and eat very well.||September 27, 2015
Kiriha||40||Nice little place for food shopping! It's a bit pricy and not everything is worth it, but you find lots of street food stalls from all over the world. Fresh produce is readily available. It's fun to walk around and look at all the food and eat!||September 27, 2015
J0J01818||50||Has to be one of the best markets around.....great atmosphere and friendly stall holders. Relax and wander around this amazing place - you will not be disappointed. ||September 26, 2015
705joycew||20||We took everyone advice by arriving there early on a Saturday at 8:30am, most of the hot food stalls were not ready. Was so looking forward to the roast pork dish but they said they won't be ready for another two hours. We tried the pie which was yummy, hubby had a breakfast burger which wasn't too bad too. Got the big a*se cookie as per the photo.Overall we were disappointed with the selection of food stalls available. I guess coming from Asian background I usually expect way more than this in a food market. I could see the crowd was getting bigger at about 10am.My advice if you would like to be there on a Saturday, be there after 10am so you won't get disappointed||September 26, 2015
107jonc||40||Go early, go hungry and go with a spending limit. The mountains of tempting food, especially the stalls groaning with delicious sweet things, will test your willpower. The English cheese shop and the tomato stall are some of the many other highlights.||September 25, 2015
Evelyn C||40||We visited the market on a Friday and found loads of food for vegetarians. We chose to eat Ethiopian and it was delicious. We knew it would be good because there was a little wait to order the food. It came in a box with bread and your choice of 3 or 4 vegetables. The costs was less than 5 pounds. Next, we moved to the desserts. Again there were lots of options and the prices were reasonable. We enjoyed it so much we returned on Sat. morning. However, the market was so busy you could barely walk. Also, we found ourselves in a different part of the market without all the vegetarian choices. So if you are a vegan or vegetarian, remember to go to the part of the market that is located just next to the Southward Cathedral.||September 25, 2015
Gen I||50||Oooh! I love the Borough Market but can never decide what to buy because everything looks so good. All the stall holders are so friendly that the whole experience is just lovely. Wandering around nearby also lets you see the Shard! ||September 25, 2015
Este_In_My_Shoes||40||One would seldom expect to find such a homey, relaxed and farm like experience in the middle of London. Established under a roof, it is an ideal setting for any kind of weather. The fresh produce is amazing and had I not been traveling, then it would for sure be one of my most regular shopping spots for produce. Take away food is also something different from the regular sandwiches and take away meals one gets in London. I would recommend it as a must visit to experience the variety the city has to offer.||September 25, 2015
Aimeemyra||40||Lovely place for breakfast or lunch! Get the pork!!!! Right down the end there is a roast pig & you can get the best food there ||September 24, 2015
Austin C||40||A large market with ready food and drinks is not a rare place in Asia. But I think it would be special in UK and Europe. The variety was big and one could always found something interesting to taste. The cost could be much since many dishes were wonderful. Suggest to go in group, that you can share food and taste for the largest variety. The website is great that one could found the shop in advance easily.Besides, is there a toilet? That would be a problem if you drinked too much.||September 24, 2015
Reemaaaa||50||It is a best place to find varieties of food, there are a lot of choices to eat , such as meat , cheese, sea food and so on. I tried the calamari and it was awesome , the best calamari ever it's very delicious and fresh .i really recommended to go. A lot of food in one place . (:||September 24, 2015
Blackwo||50||Great little barbers shop. My husband had been to hospital that day and received some bad news. I sent him in for a haircut so he could feel a bit better about himself and the guy was fabulous. Cheered him up and restored our faith in humanity. Please call in, it's well worth it. By the way, the haircut was great as well!||September 24, 2015
Travelforfun35||50||I love Borough market and visit whenever possible when going to London. It's only open Thursday's and Saturdays so pick your time. We usually walk from Parliament along the river path, meandering through Southwark, but there is a nearby tube (which escapes me). The market is a buzzing food market, very lively. Few other associated things. Worth a visit! There's also an amazing cheese shop almost opposite the market which is worth a look if you haven't yet seen every cheese possible!||September 23, 2015
legsbell||50||What a wonderful outdoor food market. Everything is fresh from the breads to cheeses to meats. Be sure to ask for samples. I had a wonderful ginger cake that was dark, dense and dangerous. The vendors will also bargain with you so go for it. Found some great cheeses as well.||September 23, 2015
KP_SP_Review||50||This is a place which is somewhat off the beaten track in the must see places. But nonetheless this is definitely a place to go to! This is a market which has many many food stalls all cooking hearty fare. The cuisine is varied, there is both vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods served. But my favourite is the stall which sells the over sized chocolate cookies. There are also a few stalls that sell oysters too. The whole area has a high energy and a good vibe about it on both a Thursday and Friday evening. There are a few places to drink around the area and the actual market is also covered so good to visit on a rainy day too! It is beside the London Bridge stop on the Jubilee Line.||September 22, 2015
15karenk||50||We were here on a Saturday around 2:30 PM. The market was VERY crowded, and you were shoulder to shoulder with people the entire time. It was, however, a place of many good vendors for prepared food, desserts, etc., but also had a farmer’s market setup as well. I am gluten free and found plenty of options there, including GF sausage and toppings, as well as a dedicated bakery called “Free From” which had a lot of allergy friendly foods. Even though it was crowded, it was still fun to explore and graze on the unique and delicious food options.||September 22, 2015
David P||30||So after the countless reviews here, we decided to pay it a visit, my partner and I love our food, so it's a no Brainer.I think we missed out on a Tuesday lunch time, as it felt empty with much of it closed, what was there was a good mix of stalls with food from around the world.In the end we settled with a steak burger from one stall, and desert from another, aye and left.It's certainly not as big as I'd expected, I'd imagined this huge market with everything edible there.||September 22, 2015
54JohnL54||40||We probably visited Borough Market at the worst possible time, early afternoon on a Saturday, as it was heaving with people and therefore way too busy and uncomfortable for a casual stroll around, but having said that, it is a 'must visit' place with its own undeniable charm.There are certainly lots of fascinating stalls selling various foods: fruit & veg, cheeses, bread, fish and meat. Also plenty of food & drink stalls with a variety of produce to suit all tastes. I must say that I thought it all a tad expensive for a 'market', so you will be hard pressed to grab a bargain, unless, perhaps any perishable goods are sold off cheaply at the end of the afternoon.One major drawback seems to be the distinct lack of seating anywhere. Just a few eateries & bars have some seats, but no where near enough for the footfall that passes through.I do not however wish to be too critical, as Borough Market is somewhat unique and certainly well worth a visit to wander round. My advice would definitely be to go early or late in the day to avoid the crowds!||September 22, 2015
Sue M||40||A great place to visit if you are a foodie, not so good if you don't like crowds. It was packed whilst we were there although it may be because the Rugby World Cup is on. Plenty of stalls selling every imaginable foodstuff. Lots of choice for all tastes||September 22, 2015
Steven L||50||I had read about London's Borough Market on the Southbank of the Thames but was not prepared for the quality and variety of food and beverage.It's open Wednesday - Saturday and is a pleasant mixture of many kinds of prepared foods, baked goods , cheeses , meats , vegetables , candies , beverages , fruits , etc. It seems as if you can scratch any food itch you want and even watch a baking school in action. It might be worthwhile to check out what is available before you start to buy and eat because you might fill up and then see something you wish you had chosen.It's fun , informal , inexpensive and worth a lok.||September 21, 2015
AJones93||50||a great place to excite the senses! hustle and bustle and smells that will make you hungry! everything from fresh produce all through to take away hot from around the world!||September 21, 2015
98hardeepn||50||Ok - I could barely move in there, I could barely have a proper look at what was on offer and the queues were ridiculous for the popular stands!But I can't let this allow me to mark it down because the variation of food, the atmosphere and quality of product were superb. I tried the venison sausages which are served in a soft bun with grilled onions and salad - it was so tasty!I also tried some Gyoza's which were brilliant - the chilli that accompanied it was HOT. Lastly, I had a duck wrap - it was VERY meaty and the plum sauce was sublime.All of the above for about £20 - not a bad lunch for two i'd say||September 21, 2015
Tracey D||50||Fab place to go, we went on a Tuesday and it was busy ,dread to think what it would be like on a Saturday. Such a wealth and selection of foods , cheeses, hams, fish anything and everything. Food stands selling pie and mash, paella, breads as well as the usuall fruit and stuff.||September 21, 2015
Roger61Texas||40||Stayed at CitizenM nearby…wandered through the market on way to Tube. Glad we did. Such a great choice of foods. The fish looked amazing. The breads wonderful. The sausages outstanding. Great people spot. If on the south bank it's worth a visit.||September 20, 2015
KimDay||30||Went on a Saturday and could not move for people. Could not look around, had to leave quick. I'm sure the market is great but could not enjoy. Way too many people on this earth! ||September 20, 2015
Mike S||50||Positive atmosphere close to river Thames (south bank near Tower Bridge) multiple stands selling wide variety of foods both cooked and uncooked plus pubs and restaurants.||September 20, 2015
jaindough||50||I wish in my heart of hearts that I lived a few blocks away from Borough market so that I could go there daily and make incredible meals for my family with all the wonderful this they sell there!My husband, baby and I spent a good hour walking through the market and taste testing a variety of delicious things. We had incredible homemade doughnuts and had really yummy cured meats and my husband also tried a local, non-bubbly cider (which I thought tasted a bit sour). We had a great time and we left smiling with full tums.||September 20, 2015
Anny R||50||So much to see, smell & taste! Such an assortment of food, it's incredible! If I lived in London, I'd probably camp right outside, or pop over whenever I could. If you love trying out different kinds of food, then you've got to visit at least once! (Ever thought there could be more than one way to serve you mustard? Well ... go and find out!)||September 20, 2015
katnaes||40||I do have a thing for markets, and Borough does not disappoint. It may seem like a daunting task once you get there, making your way through due to the massive crowds that it attracts, but I can tell you that it is worth visit. There is so much fresh food, with all different sorts of vendors. It definitely makes you wish you lived just around the corner...||September 20, 2015
Kay H||50||This is an incredible place, I love it! It has multiple vendors with really good products, I wish I lived nearer.||September 19, 2015
hdk29||50||Had a bite before the Tate - mix and match fresh bread and cheese, enjoyed the colorful stall and vibrant atmosphere! Lots of tasting options can get you appetite going....||September 19, 2015
AlisonCheshire||50||Good food to buy to take home or eat in. The butcher knows the sources of his meat and its delicious!||September 19, 2015
PeterGrobler||50||Borough Market is a "must visit" destination in London for the most amazing selection of artisanal foods and drinks you can imagine. A real treat!||September 19, 2015
Krisna C||50||Great walk through experience , the color the food the ambiance,the aromas so festive and colorful. They have all types of foods .||September 19, 2015
CNMoore||50||If you enjoy markets, you will adore Borough Market. It is a bustling Mecca of delicious tastes, smells and feasts for your eyes. There is an incredibly broad array of choices- something for everyone. Many samples to whet your taste buds. Definitely a foodie heaven.||September 19, 2015
Bathsalt||50||Love Borough Market....stopped off at London Bridge from a boat trip. Walked to the market which was buzzing. My friend and I enjoyed a Gujarati takeaway lunch. Tried to get a coffee at Monmouth coffee but queue snaking down the street so we went to a lovely cafe a cross from Monmouth.Great day.... It's a Must!  ||September 18, 2015
HektorT||50||Been here 5 years ago. The stall serving rump steak sandwich is still at the same spot, with higher price tag at 7.5 pounds now. It's still very guilty to have it for breakfast. However, it just tastes good. Noticed that more and more stalls are selling similar items. It proves the popularity for having guilty food in the morning here.||September 18, 2015
terry h||40||you need to check the scales on the liquorish stall very doggy apart from that a great atmosphere great place to go||September 18, 2015
Tash2414||50||Came across Borough Market after visiting another attraction, some amazing stalls selling good quality produce, lots of opportunities to taste as well. Great Atmosphere ||September 18, 2015
Darren R||40||First time going to Borough Market and it was great. Lots of little stalls selling food, drink, cheese, fish, fruit and vegetables. It is under cover so doesn't matter if it is raining or not. Great vibe. Well worth a visit to try the food :)||September 18, 2015
Sarah D||50||The Borough Market is fantastic, we had a great time browsing the stalls. We had coffee, iced tea, a roast pork sandwich, paella and a brownie - all were pretty good! We were also really impressed by the cheese stalls. We'll be visiting the Borough Market again next time we're in London.||September 18, 2015
WorldExplorerFL||50||Lots of options from fruits, to breads, cheese, and fish, this market has it all. We visited the market early in the morning, and ended up buying some fruits, bread, and cheese for our day touring London. Everything was fresh and tasty. I highly recommend the cheese store (Jumi Cheese), really good.||September 17, 2015
Zeynep K||50||Omg, I was hearing about this place before but all this time I spent in London I didn't have much time to visit.Finally on my last Saturday I went there.It was absolutely amazing !! Basically borough market has two different parts. When you enter the door near London bridge station,the main door, you can find different species of olives,oil, bread, sausages, cheese, mushrooms etc. and also a few places to eat but when you keep walking through these things you will find another part of borough market called 'green market', that is the place of eating different kind of foods from all around the world. I saw a long queue in front of sth I don't remember the name but it's close to the entrance of green park. It was melted cheese with boiled potatoes omg it was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten I regret not eating one more time and I regret putting borough market in the end of my list:( by the way, don't go there with more than 2people it's very difficult to hang out with your friends in that crowd.||September 17, 2015
pjtomas||50||This a good place to visit any time. You can have a glass of wine, tea, coffee, beer, try one hamburger or even a pork sandwich. The atmosphere is quite nice and the diversity is exiting.||September 17, 2015
Saintlysinner||40||This place was much better before. However, since it's become a tourist attraction things have gotten more expensive and you see more "chains" here rather than the independent stalls you used to see before. Having said that the food stalls are impressive and you just want to try everything from their lovely cakes to pulled pork sandwiches. I do love Borough market just gutted it's lost its old charm. ||September 17, 2015
ExpeditionEnthusiast||50||Easily accessible from the London Bridge tube station, exploring Borough Market is a easy and fun way to spend the afternoon. With lots of different food stalls and the fabulous Monmouth coffee next door, it's often my first stop with visiting friends and family. It can get quite busy so come earlier if you aren't up for battling the crowds!||September 17, 2015
Davide L||50||One of my favourite London markets, you can find anything, any kind of food or spice from any country. Whatever you choose to buy the chances to get a genuine and delightful thing are high.||September 17, 2015
Alison H||40||Brilliant market experience, my first in London and what a great experience. Busy, great browsing, awesome selection of food and stuff to buy. The hot pastrami sandwich was the best I ever had!||September 16, 2015
CamNat||50||We had a wonderful early afternoon walking around this market - it's such an amazing experience with such a wide range of food being offered by so many vendors. ||September 16, 2015
UKMary611||40||Things are quite expensive in Borough Market, but the produce is all very good, great range of things to choose from and good for seasonal food. Fun to see all the different foods and try to samples.||September 16, 2015
Lovetravel02||50||Stunning markets. A huge pleasure to wander through, and even better to buy plenty to take with you. ||September 16, 2015
Anders H||50||Borough Market is a is a great, cozy place with food for everyone with a nose for quality, you can get almost anything, and for someone like me who do not usually interested in cooking, it's just the place to start learning to cook.||September 15, 2015
710lukem||50||Loved the markets. The food on particular. There was all kinds of food from every corner of the globe. Would tell anyone visiting London to have lunch there at least once. Easy as to get there. It's right next to London bridge station.||September 15, 2015
Francesca Š||50||It's not La Boqueria, but it's a well organised market offering everything you would need for a quick lunch, local and foreign food and lots of fresh ingredients . If you have a sweet tooth you need to try the donoughts with various types of filling. ||September 15, 2015
LordieLordie||50||Well worth a visit to traditional London market which serves the punters not just the well breeched.Wonderful smells of bread ,coffee,meat and breakfasts,lots of sales pitch going on .Stalls plied high with delectable fayre and not expensive.Great breakfast but didn't make a note of the cafe name ... If we had been staying longer we would have bought lots of fruit as it looked fresh and delicious.||September 15, 2015
Salsaqueen140||50||I went to Borough market for the first time couple of weeks ago. After reading many reviews on Tripadvisor and hearing frienss speak hifhly of it, I reckoned it would be worth a visit. Excellent display of the food and such a variety of food stall. It did not dissappoint. I will be planning another visit soon. ||September 14, 2015
Hawazin A||50||Great place with many varity of food, frindly people with a smile and the atmosphere is nice, Family friendly, DON"T MISS :)||September 14, 2015
Elizabeth C||50||Enjoyed a great experience visiting Borough Markets. The traders are friendly and constantly offering "tastes", so much so we had to refuse to taste. Bought a meal to share as the portions are very generous. The only downside is that there was nowhere to sit while we ate as there is limited seating.||September 14, 2015
153jessicag||50||Nice spot to walk around while looking and smelling all the foods. Come here to eat lunch or just have a snack. We went a few times because we just really enjoyed it.||September 14, 2015
Abby G||50||Borough Market is a place for foodie fun! There are various vendors where you can find sandwiches, Indian curries, desserts, baked goods, beverages, you name it! The food is fantastic and at a reasonable price. Plus, it's a great way to try a bunch of food varieties with friends! Locals and tourists alike will love the Borough Market.||September 14, 2015
JudeL213||50||A great place for a Saturday wander with a good mixture of tourists and locals. There's some great fresh produce and some unusual things to sample along the way. You can easily spend a couple of hours, but go hungry, the hot food stalls are outstanding! ||September 14, 2015
Evelina_Rom||50||this is a type of flea market, where people come with artisanal food and sweets, I liked it better than the famous Boqueria, which is very commercial.I found some fine cheese and some delicious pies there.They also have different types of honey and home-made drinks.||September 14, 2015
PaulL582||50||Not much you can say except Wow when visiting this market. Doesn't really matter what you are looking for - they will have it. An incredible selection of foods to buy and also food to eat there. It's a large enough space where you never felt really crowded, it's laid out sensibly. Highly recommended for anyone into food.||September 14, 2015
Clane1907||50||we went today (Monday) after discussing with a hotel rep. The market was open and it appears that they are open on Tuesday as well. I would estimate that 90% of the shops were open. Interesting visit.||September 14, 2015
Sophie_Albanite||40||My friend lives just round the corner from Borough market so we often pop in for Brunch together or go for drinks in the evening. It's great for picking up food or having brunch but a little buzzy with tourists so I prefer to go in the evening or early in the morning.||September 14, 2015
Weyden||40||When you are visiting the Tate Modern and the Globe, drop by the Borough Market. It is wonderful just to wander around, look, and imagine -- truffles. pigeon breasts. quail. the cheeses, the wines. the veggies. We bought dinner -- venison burgers, salad makings, wine. We took them back to our rented flat, cooked, and enjoyed.But even if we had not been buying dinner, there were snacks galore. And lots to see, even if you weren't buying.||September 13, 2015
JoeGregory||40||When I was told about Borough Market I was expecting a normal market. How wrong I was, this is not somewhere you could do your local shop, unless you stock your kitchen with expensive fruit and veg and alternative meats and cheeses.Don't get me wrong I found it amazing, but make you go with plenty on cash as the market sells some of the best mixture of produce you can find in London under one roof. When I visited I bought cheeses, salami and herbs. I managed to get some items I'd previously had to order from specialist websites which was great.I really recommending visiting if you really are a foodie like me otherwise you might want to give it a miss.||September 13, 2015
alexl761||50||One of the beat places for lunch in London. A huge variety so there is something for everyone, and the prices are good. Very busy, go earlier on a week day if you'd like to visit without a huge crowd. My favorite stall is Le Marche du Quarter. Don't let the long line deter you. It moves fast and the duck sandwich is not to be missed. They have a huge vat of it to stuff sandwiches with all day! ||September 13, 2015
brisemark||50||The area has a fantastic atmosphere and you can get, and eat, a wealth of exotic foods and some foods that are not so exotic but are nevertheless very tempting to taste or buy. It was a revisit to this area and we will be back there again. It is also to stand or sit in the street with a pint in hand. Our favourite pub is the Wheatsheaf. The 'Bombardier' on the day we visited was an extremely good pint.A definite must for all.||September 13, 2015
emilyt323||40||Have been wanting to come here for ages and it definitely didn't disappoint. So many amazing smells and loads of different types of food. It was absolutely packed at the weekend so I'd love to go back on a quieter day so I can explore it properly.||September 13, 2015
travelmate182||50||Nom nom but expensive! Then again, it's London and everything is expensive. Make sure you visit this market but note that it is closed on Sunday's.||September 13, 2015
david d||50||One of the most eye and stomach appealing food markets I have ever seen. From chick pea and sweet potato burgers for vegetarians to individually tailored meat wraps- borough market is ideal to catch a bite to eat.||September 13, 2015
Pumperman||50||Very atmospheric, located below the clattering railway lines out of London Bridge, the market is easy to access from London Bridge station (just ask anyone and they will point you in the right direction).A must if you are visiting London.A fantastic foodie market, routinely appearing in chefs TV series, and a must for tourists and locals alike. I use Borough Market to stock up on spices, and whilst likely to be more expensive than surrounding ethnic supermarkets, I love the choice, the vibe and the opportunity to taste food from other stalls.Once finished at the market, I would recommend walking down to the Thames and taking a stroll in a westerly direction along the river, taking in The Globe theatre, the Tate Modern gallery, Southbank, then crossing for either St Paul's Cathedral or the West End shops. A great day out.||September 13, 2015
skigirlnh||50||We visited the market on a weekday morning and walked through admiring the great variety of food. It was actually a good time to go, since we could check out all of the stalls before it got too crowded. The choices are endless......it all looked so good! We went for a long walk along The Thames and came back to big crowds at lunchtime. We opted for the falafel wraps, and they were GOOD - Headed to the chocolate stall next, and picked up a nice selection of dark and milk chocolate covered nuts, which we snacked on while riding the Hop-On Hop-Off Bus. Great day.||September 12, 2015
anmhaith||50||Have been visiting Borough Market over the past 8 years - Saturday is one of the best days to visit - very busy but also vibrant then. Lots of stalls to visit with a variety of foods to buy/sample including fruits, vegetables, cheese, fish, bread, meats etc. Also there are numerous shops, pubs and restaurants right next to the market itself. Well worth visiting.||September 12, 2015
Erik E||40||We went for a look around for a picnic lunch, lots of variety and good atmosphere. Bottle of Prosecco for £10! Lots of British food and produce but also many international options.A bit expensive but you can grab value for money if you look for it! Lots and lots of cheese! We also recommend the pimms cups on a hot summers day!Definitely would go again!||September 12, 2015
skimmilk70||50||This place is amazing!!!! Make it a priority if you consider yourself a foodie. They have everything you could want. They have so many fresh juices with lots of fruits and vegetables. They have giant meringues as well as Raclette. One of the best duck confit sandwiches are found here. I was here 2 years ago and they've added even more food stalls. ||September 12, 2015
onceisnotenough30||50||I have been here quite a few times. It s a weekend market and we usually go for a quick lunch here. There are so many cuisines, from all around Europe, but also African, Indian, Middle eastern and American ones. I love the raclette and our kid loves the German Deli stand, where I buy him Bavarian wurst hot dogs. I also love the Ethiopian cuisine here. My husband usually goes for the Middle eastern or Indian cuisine. I also love the Italian stands where you can buy gelatos and the French stands, from where we buy breads and cheeses. The stands where you can buy wines, champagne or prosecco by the glass are also amazing. There are also quite a few restaurants inside the market.||September 12, 2015
Ian J||50||I really love visiting Borough market so much as it really has just has so much to offer everyone who visits, it`s just great to visit for breakfast or lunch or even for your take away`s it`s got to be the fantastic Borough market.Even you hate markets i really challenge you to visit here i know your going to like it, it offers a fusion of foods from around the world. So take yourself to borough market just 2 minutes from London bridge station.||September 12, 2015
Kattherat||40||Yum. Stroll around and enjoy the aromas and sample some yummy food. Beautiful cheeses, staked tables of delicious baked goods, great coffee. Enjoy!||September 12, 2015
LESTER L||40||A pretty cool market with a huge selection of food choices, from cheeses, to olive oil, to paella, to sausages, fresh fruits, the list goes on. A foodies' paradise. Located near the London Bridge station, it is quite easy to locate. Very very busy place. Worth a visit. Might not even need to spend a cent, just go around the different stores offering free taste.||September 12, 2015
emilymarie21||50||Borough Market is a great place to go around lunchtime. There are so many different types of food to chose from, and the prices are quite reasonable. You can also sample food from many of the vendors; definitely worth a visit.||September 11, 2015
Danielle P||40||We visited on a Saturday right around lunch time so the whole place was packed. The place is huge and it was fun walking around and seeing all the artisanal food and items but the fact that it was so busy made me want to leave after 20 minutes. Next time I'll try to get there early in the morning to beat the crowds. The bathroom in the sitting area in the back was surprisingly clean.||September 11, 2015
gosiak817||50||I love Borough Market. I go there almost every Saturday and have my favourite bites. Veggie burgers, green smoothies, bread, cheese, tomatoes, olives oil just to list a few;) you can usually taste a lot of things before you decide to buy it. Most vendors are very nice and engaging but some can be rude and arrogant. It is very busy, especially around lunch time, so I think the best time to go there would be a bit earlier...it's a must-do on London Saturday list!:)||September 11, 2015
Lilly G||40||This is a fantastic market and an absolute must if you are interested in great food and high quality produce.||September 11, 2015
nomad808||50||Very lively market with great food stalls, ranging from roast pork on a spit, Indian Middle Eastern tasty snacks and other tantalising choices. There is also a general produce and deli section to the market which looks very appetising.||September 10, 2015
JakeHerp||50||Borough Market is great to discover food from across the world. Its located close to the river Thames, so my suggestion is to grab a bite to eat and head down to the river.||September 10, 2015
Montyf1||50||Something for everyone, and everything for gluttons. Eat ready made or buy fresh ingredients to make your own. Don't leave without having a pad Thai, a salt beef bap and a scrumpy cider.||September 10, 2015
adam M||50||Very cool place and worth a stroll through for lunch. Quirky and unique food stalls which so much atmosphere. Do it! ||September 10, 2015
KaterinaMajor||40||Visited this market as we just love food. The variety of the food is overwhelming, we wanted to taste everything, but ended up also buying some cheeses, juice, sweets, chocolate to take away. It is great, very busy though, some stalls have long lines waiting to be served, and you constantly get stepped on. But if you love food, you have to visit this or one of the similar open markets of the city.||September 10, 2015
Pincho43||40||Have a wander grab a bite to eat and a beer clock a few vacant looking hipsters who are colonising huge swathes of town smashing fun happy days ||September 10, 2015
FriderikaV||50||Great outdoor dining places! Brilliant food and drinks! Family and small local businesses with fresh food and uniqueness!!! ( be careful with seafood tho, especially afternoon / evening time on a hot day ) ||September 9, 2015
Maayan P||50||The market is full of fresh produce, wonderful spices, a huge selection of cheese, baking goods, and ofcourse amazing food court area. English classics, indian, french, german and the list goes on and on. Taste EVERYTHING you see, it's worth it :)I recommend getting there at 10:00 pm, the vendors are mostly set up and the market is almost empty, you can wander around without any noises or distractions and walk around freely.||September 9, 2015
Gemma T||50||Would highly recommend going here for lunch- so much delicious food to choose from. I went on a Saturday and again on a week day. Its veryyyyy busy on the weekend but there are way more stalls open.||September 9, 2015
jeanniedDover_Kent||40||Having an hour to kill in this area of London I decided to wander round the market. I couldn't believe how much food was on display and the variety of it. For anyone interested in food this is the place to go. I didn't buy anything but it all looked delicious although some of it was quite expensive. The sights and the smells were amazing. Even on a fleeting visit such as mine it was an enjoyable way to spend the time. I will go again when I have more time and will definitely buy some of the produce next time and plan my visit over a mealtime so I can enjoy a leisurely lunch.||September 9, 2015
philsagun||50||Vibrant market with lots of fresh local produce and great feeds from all cultures. Had a good Ethiopian lunch whilst my friends had German and Spanish food with a cheeky drink on the side. Kind of like Night Market in Melbourne. Location is great, easy to get to and a must do in London. ||September 8, 2015
Furry1208||40||This is a nice big market in London bridge. Very strange but interesting foods on sale. Some funny smells too! Nearby you will also find some nice little places to eat.||September 8, 2015
quickrunner7||50||Undoubtedly the best market in town. Fancy something? Borough market will have it, not only will they just sell it, they will have the finest quality of it. I am talking the majority about food, but that is the main attraction in our lives these days. Sometimes I am tempted to take pictures of the stalls just because they are so vibrant and are heaving with stock. Cheap as chips and you will be dashing for the nearest cash point when you suddenly realise you have so much to buy.||September 8, 2015
benny001||50||What more can I say. The fresh food is fabulous, the site is steeped in history and the street food makes for a great morning out. Try the Ethiopian takeaway (at the Southwark Cathedralend of the market) it's different but a real treat for lunch especially on a cool day. ||September 8, 2015
Forgodssakeidontcare||50||always happy to find myself in this part of town, the food in the market is expensive but very very good. Get there early and munch till lunchtime.||September 8, 2015
Jan D||50||Well now this a foodie's dream come true. If it's not here you're not going to find it anywhere. Heaps of food tastings and gourmet delights.||September 8, 2015
Top_Contributor||50||I always enjoy spending time in Borough Market. Lots of interesting sights. Just wander around and have a look at all the fantastic market stalls. Try some of the wide selection of food on offer or have a drink in a local pub. Excellent. A definite must for any tourist (or local) when in the area.||September 7, 2015
mark d||50||Found this by accident and loved it, can get just about anything here in the way of foods, from wild boar burgers to a full range of sweet stuff and all things in between.....definitely worth a visit if your a bit of a foodie||September 7, 2015
Danny_S_Is||40||If you are in the vicinity, it's worth coming to this market and tasting different varieties of food, at the stalls around.||September 7, 2015
Daisy S||50||A must-visit spot in London. Stumbled across it by accident with my fiancé on a trip to the Tate Britain. The food there was amazing - so much to choose from and just a great experience. If you're looking for lunch in London that's a bit different with a great atmosphere and for decent prices, go here!||September 7, 2015
Judith D||50||We went to a Borough Market on Saturday, and had a great time seeing all the different foods of the world||September 7, 2015
gemmaAXC||50||This market is truly magical! I stayed in London for the weekend and Borough market was a highlight for me, anyone visiting the area must ensure they see the market. Sensory overload and food heaven.||September 7, 2015
MandLinNJ||40||This is definitely worth a visit. Went on a Saturday afternoon. There were many stalls selling food. You can get almost anything from cheese to savory pies to fresh meats and produce. I found the market disorganized and very crowded.||September 6, 2015
lazyvalentina||50||Extremely busy but worth the fight through the tourist crowds for excellent butchers, fishmongers and grocers. Stop by the oyster man for some excellent treats too!||September 6, 2015
louisebX9233BS||50||Place covered with roof, quite nice in a raining day. You can buy food from at least 20 different nationalities. A huge mixture of ready to eat, fruit & flowers, veggies, chocolate & sweets, cheese, bread, olives, fresh fish, sausages and 100 other specialties. Expensive but looking so good that I could spent far to much money here. A down to earth stemming, with lots of organic stuff. The small streets around the market are filled with cosy small restaurants and cafes.To go there use London bridge tube station.||September 6, 2015
Nigel R||40||It is hardly surprising that Borough Market is so busy. It is full of a range of food you don't get everywhere to be eaten whilst wandering through the stalls. We tried raclette from one stall, Ethiopian wraps from another and vegetarian curry from another, washed down with Pimms and Sangria. There are many other stalls all set out in an under-cover market building and under the railway. Definitely worth a visit.||September 6, 2015
Lisa O||50||There is a huge choice of beers, cheeses, breads, cakes etc.. but also loads of street food stalls. Definitely come here for lunch and try it all||September 6, 2015
johntC1663LQ||40||Well worth visiting and even though the food is a tad expensive it was good quality but not as good as Greenwich Marker but better than Spitalfields. You could The walk along the south bank is fantastic and it has been elevated to provide great views of the river and city. The Market is well signposted from London Bridge Station||September 6, 2015
gavinm733||50||A must see. If you are a fan of food-truck style eats and farmers' markets, this is grand for lunch and a stroll.||September 5, 2015
Zhen27||50||We loved this place, foodie heaven! So much fresh produce and lots of stalls selling freshly cooked food. We stuffed our faces with amazing burgers, pork belly rolls, pastries, all eaten standing up. There's also great English pubs if you prefer a sit down experience. We enjoyed it so much that we wanted to go back before we left London, but unfortunately we ran out of time. So. Sad. ||September 5, 2015
Roadrunner2772||50||The market is really good, it's worth a visit, mostly a Saturday morning before it gets busy.Plenty of food to taste and buy, very good cheeses, sausages, etc...||September 5, 2015
maevious||30||A interesting place with lots of different smells and dishes from all over the world prices are a bit high but worth visiting to see an other sight of London ||September 5, 2015
KranAsh||40||One of the most happening places in London for innovative food and catch up joint. It closes at 5 30. You cant really shop much as the food and stuff is expensive than the local prices but experiencing the unique market is fun. Place is full of various aromas. If you are a food lover then it is must visit.||September 5, 2015
IntrepidTraveller777||40||Array of foods, something for everyone. Delicious. Near London Bridge stn. Lots of stalls. Free toilets round the back. Near Southwark Cathedral, worth a visit for sure. On the Southbank walk, so lots to see there||September 5, 2015
231ChrisH||30||i used to love Borough Market with all the fresh food sellers, Neals Yard for cheeses etc and they are still there but less of them and now the place has become a fast food haven where you can go for lunch and try burgers, pulled pork sandwiches and Asian cuisine.To me its just not the same but if you havent been there before its probably worth a visit.||September 5, 2015
patto46||50||If you are travelling in London, a "must do stop" is the Borough Markets in Southwark, near the London Bridge and the Shard.Markets have been going since the 1700s and are magnificent. It is now a ritual when visiting London to stock up the pantry at them.The array, presentation, and quality is incredible (must admit not cheap, but!) the people fantastic, atmosphere great and just a fun place to spend a couple of hours just browsing (and tasting).Several tradition English pubs in the area for lunch, easy transport with the Tube so it makes for a different excursion, particularly for food lovers.||September 4, 2015
annaeire||50||So much to choose from. So many delicious things. Everywhere we stopped to buy anything, the staff was so nice and attentive. From a burger, to fruit, to cheese... Great service, great quality. ||September 4, 2015
Nickielondon99||40||A lot of national food here Thai , Spanish , Scottish etc... Quite expensive for vegetable, fresh seafood, fruits but good quality. If you are a big fan of oyster, I would recommend you to Richard Howard's oyster bar. They are friendly people and good fresh oyster.||September 4, 2015
VictoriaUKUSA||50||Meet Chris at Urban Cheese! Try the amazing breads, sweets and beautiful street food!!Stuff your face as you walk around and find new amazing flavours!!||September 4, 2015
Eugene K||50||Very sizable food market with a great selection of foods and flavors -- from exotic from the other side of the world to local organic. Special nod to Bread Ahead bakery (they teach baking classes too at their location on the same square).Overall -- a lunch spot that should not to be missed.||September 3, 2015
Cinnamon0321||50||Olivier's bakery is the best bakery and offers the finest breads. I bought honey sourdough which was absolutely delicious and genuinely wowed my guests. The lady at the bakery was so kind and friendly and took the time to find me exactly what I was looking for (thank you!). I would recommend a trip to anyone who visits Borough market. Absolutely delicious!||September 3, 2015
921elizabethl||40||food food food everywhere -this is a foodie's paradise - but you need deep pockets to try out the offers as not cheap -having tried a tangy sample of venison burger, we shared one piece only to find out that the sampler was indeed spicier; a tad disappointing but hey, who gets to sell such back home? moving on, the breads & pastry carts are all over, handmade chocolates of all sorts, craft beers & ciders, organic fruits & veggies, a mushroom specialty shop manned by someone who talks botany, herb & spice corners, wine shops, seafood & fresh oysters shucked at your command (after you pay), coffee boutiques grinding beans & brewing by hand, food stalls offering Ethiopian, Thai, German delights - even ice cream from goat's milk! certainly something for several visits!||September 2, 2015
Beingrl||50||Not just for the selection of organic and artisan foods, but also the local eateries and proximity to the cultural activities of Southbank and the Thames. I'm always spoiled for choice here so often go alone, or arrive early, so I don't have to share my senses. Always more fun with a buddy though. Live music, skate park and art galleries etc are just around the corner. An amble and a chat make for an awesome morning out.||September 2, 2015
pollylouisajames||40||Great variety of foods there, London prices but it's all very tasty. A must do if you're in the area! Has some great street food. Would recommend! ||September 2, 2015
Onthego1950||50||A fun and busy place to visit and to indulge in whatever food hits your fancy from trendy to organic to traditional English food. So many choices, it was hard to decide what to have!!||September 1, 2015
doyleyboy||50||Lovely to wander around trying bites and dishes off the lovely stalls. I wish there was something similar near my home. A great place for a group of friends to eat drink and enjoy a day out.||September 1, 2015
Mesa28||50||Great market to find the best quality surrunded with the best atmosphere. Great place if you want to have lunch. Being so turistic, sometimes can be too much, but if you want to know the 'city buzz', definetly have to go to Borough Market.||September 1, 2015
whereistarablog||50||I love this place. Every time I'm in London I have to go! I would eat there for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I had a cheesecake brownie and it was amazing! It's great fo vegetarians. The flowers here are beautiful too.||September 1, 2015
pacolovesmixi||50||Awesome marlet. great place to. have lunch and. enjoy of. food. of. all. around. the world. there are few tourist and. for me the food. is. better than. camden's market! highly recommend! I'm gonna visit it again for sure. great combinations by. bus and a metro station a few meters away||September 1, 2015
JasynT||50||It has everything fresh just like a traditional market should be. But it combines with little shops selling food as well. But make sure you check their opening time before you go, you won't find stalls ready until the market is 'open'. ||September 1, 2015
intlwanderlust||50||I adore this market for so many reasons. It's great for people-watching, it's right off the Thames, it's surrounded by some fab restaurants, it's next to a lovely cathedral and there can be bargains. I recommended getting there early.||September 1, 2015
SweetLondonUK||50||Love love love Borough Market, it's a sensory heaven with wonderful food smells and tastes from around the globe. Cheeses, spices, oils, vinegars, fish, meat, bread and lots of it is locally produced as well. Bacon rolls for breakfast, paella for lunch and if your visiting in the Pre Christmas season then mulled ciders and wines will keep the cold out. ||September 1, 2015
CDMG123||40||My partner's favorite spot in London! you can always find whatever you're looking for in addition to finding things you had never heard of. It's a fun afternoon to stroll through and try whatever catches your interest.||September 1, 2015
MisterD25||40||Came here for lunch after a trip on the Emirates Air Line. A great selection of food from all over the world. We really were spoilt for choice. It was packed on the Saturday we visited so a bit of a push and shove to get to some stalls. Would highly recommend it for a quick lunch or snack.||September 1, 2015
Martha M||50||There are so many places to try different foods. You can just wander around and choose different snacks and drinks. The oysters there were enormous and delicious. I also enjoyed the squid but there is a huge range of foods. It's a great way to spend a couple of hours.||September 1, 2015
Jason G||40||Walked through Borough market en-route to the the Golden Hind. It was VERY busy (as it was Saturday) but all in all it is so my type of place and a foodie's paradise.So many stalls selling so many foods and food related goods. I could quite easily do all my food shopping here if money, time and travel were no object!||September 1, 2015
AnaPiussi||50||I love to go to this place, I can go repeteadlly with no problem. A nice street market, with many food options, choose the sandwiches or the raclettes, you will love. In the cover part besides the food places, you can find fruits, vegetables, meats, is a great option to make you grocey. I always like to buy cheese there, as the chesse producer have a good variety and the price as great as well. I take this place as perfect for the workers in the area, as a great tourist point. Besides the river, in front of a church where you can enjoy music at lunch. ||August 31, 2015
403jennar||50||Plan to spend a couple hours at this market- get here early so they don't run out of samples! If you're staying in a self catering apt plan to pick up your breads, spreads, fruits and veggies here. There is a fabulous coffee shop right next door (marmouth I think it's called) and a great brunch place above it. Foodie Heaven!||August 31, 2015
rdizzle2020||50||This is one of the places that I always have to go to when I visit London. The sights and the smells can't be beat. The full market isn't always open so check the website before you go. Try to go when Neal's Yard Dairy is open and get some amazing cheeses. Last time I was there I got a meat pie and mushy peas. Yum!||August 31, 2015
ReallyNiceChef||50||Great for tourists and locals! I got a great goat wrap and loads of tasters. I look forward to my next visit. Nice to walk around||August 31, 2015
EBH82||40||Love going to see the fresh produce at borough market. Lots of places to grab something to eat on the move or sit in. The only disadvantage now Are the crowds!||August 31, 2015
Ayesha S||50||We only came by this place by chance as we were starting a tour up the road. Omg!!! The smell- is absolutely amazing!!! Everywhere you turn is the most amazing food and drink. We didn't have much time to spend here but we got a smoothie and a cheesecake and they were delicious!! We have decided next time we are up in London we are going back to have lunch!!! Could be a nice place to get some foodie Christmas presents if you wanted that sort of thing!!! ||August 31, 2015
MrKesh||50||Whether you want to grab a bit for lunch, buy some fresh ingredients to cook or just wander around and experience some fancy food, Borough Market is the place to go.I always recommend the cajun fish and prawn wrap to people who visit the city. It is just outside Applebee's restaurant and it is one of the best kept (food) secrets in London.Be aware that on Mondays a lot of stalls are closed.||August 31, 2015
SissyTsk||50||Original, authentic, tasty food from many regions, we combined scallops with venison burger, baklava and Turkish coffee with shepherd's pie and bruschetta with truffle oil. Lots of sampling, some little tables, perfect for a lunch spot you won't feel hungry. Must visit!!!||August 31, 2015
eldadr2013||40||A very nice food market, see that its not active all week, nice atmosphere , sometimes its crowded, but bearable, and you can get launch there as well. we tried the Oysters (fresh and yummy) and the goat meat stall (Kofta is good the sovlaky bit chewy.||August 31, 2015
karula76||50||During my 4 day stay in London, I had lunch at Burough market every single day. Such a great variety of foods, great vibe, and awesome people watching, this is a must during your stay in London. Try La Porteña Argentinean food stand. They have delicious empanadas and steak sandwiches! ||August 30, 2015
kennys791||50||Borough market is a delightful collection of independent street food vendors, and offers a virtual paradise for foodies. For Americans this place is most comparable to Chelsea market (only in an outdoor setting). My wife and I enjoyed amazingly unique sandwiches from the Gullible manor, and found another vendor selling delicious raspberry tarts for dessert. Borough markets was recommended to us by two different guides at London attractions, as well as Rick Steeves. It's easy to see why it's ranked so highly, it is definitely not to be missed by anyone traveling to London!||August 30, 2015
lovinmambo||50||Love coming here, summer or winter its great, love the atmosphere and the food stalls are amazing , try the salt beef rolls they are lovely||August 30, 2015
markjtnet74||50||I had intended to get breakfast at Borough Market but had been put off by impression that after 9.00am it's too busy to get close and as such excluded it from our itinerary.As we slowly walked up the riverside from Tower Bridge we'd lost the path at London Bridge station. As we backtracked down towards the station there was this amazing smell in the air and someone passed us with a Bratwurst. We headed down the steps and walked straight into Borough Market.The smells, sounds and atmosphere is as every market should be. Within ten minutes I was already stuffed having consumed 'brunch' in three courses. My only regret is as we walked further in was that I had neither neither the time or space in my stomach to enjoy more.There is something for everyone and for every purse. I just wish there was more seating so you could watch the world go by. Plenty of banter between the store holders gives the impression that it's not just the locals and the tourists enjoying the market.Don't be put off by the warnings of crowds and be sure to visit with an empty stomach.||August 30, 2015
michielh||50||The place to go in London if you're a foodie! Great atmosphere and absolutely amazing food, highly recommended!||August 30, 2015
JianaD||50||Superb selection with enough price variety to suit all. Great area to explore too.We got their for 8am opening on a Sat. Bit too early for some stalls but fun to see the market coming to life. Cheese lovers and those with a sweet tooth will be impressed (I was).||August 29, 2015
Mary T||50||This market is heaven on earth. A vast cornucopia of everything you'd ever want to eat. Go with friends and family, or with people you've just met, so you can share offerings from the wonderful purveyors. There is just too much to sample and taste: baked goods, paella, oysters, fudge, olives, baklava, spices, cheese, beer, wine, meat pies, cookies, pulled pork sandwiches, noodles, boureki, juices, and on and on.Try the cider (they will add ginger beer to your pint if you ask) at New Forest Cider, try all the cheeses at Neal's Yard Dairy, the real licorice at Sweet Roots. Purveyors come on different days, so best be safe and go to the Market on Saturday.It'll be crowded, but that's part of the fun!We actually built this visit (not our first) to London around the Saturday market. We stayed at an Airbnb just down the road, and spent the day at the Market. No regrets.||August 29, 2015
ciaragirl10||50||This market is great if you're a foody. You can try so many different things and you'll be spoilt for choice. Go hungry and be prepared for crowds of people queuing for food. You'll want to visit again and again. A brilliant place a stones throw from London Bridge.||August 28, 2015
freshwaterstone||50||They have unlimited supply of foods from street foods, restaurants to fresh meat and vegetables. Go there super hungry, otherwise you will regret. Who said England has no good foods?? Go and check by yourself :-)||August 28, 2015
Chin W||50||I love a good market! and it doesn’t get better than Borough Market London. t’s not just about the food on offer but also about the people and place.Borough Market is a wholesale and retail food market in Southwark, Central London, England. One of the largest and oldest market in London. The market is located across London Bridge train station. If you haven’t been to Borough Market, please make sure you bump this to the top of of your to-do list.||August 28, 2015
happycustomerno5||50||Never been here before and it's a delight to the taste buds and a must for travelers to see a different side of London||August 28, 2015
Kapellbruecke||50||We spent a morning in borough market before heading to Spain! The market has many interesting foods and drinks you can try and buy! We had organic lemon tea and curry chicken rice, both were prepared on spot! We also enjoyed the coffee in Monmouth and bought some organic skincare in Neals Yard remedies! All of us enjoyed the visit so much! Worth to visit!||August 28, 2015
Q4208ABpeterl||50||Loved the variety and choice on display here, and just wished we lived closer. We would shop here all the time, as the food has such appeal, fresh and vibrant flavours, unusual ingredients, and the food artisans are so enthusiastic. We took away what we could carry, ate there and enjoyed savouring the things we could not take with us. ||August 28, 2015
roz t||50||The Markets were celebrating 1000 yrs of history on this site when we visited. The choice of fresh street food is incredible and the cultures and cuisines represented is amazing. We've been to loads of similar places around the world but Borough Market is definatly the best. Don't miss it if you visit London!||August 27, 2015
Ruth S||50||You can travel the world under 1 roof, you can walk round and taste the different foods of the world. The fresh fruit looks really good and is displayed lovely. It is free to walk around you don't have to buy anything. But the cakes, bread, fruit, veg, meat, cheese and sweets are so tempting it is hard to resist. A lovely way to spend a couple of hours in London.||August 27, 2015
263stephenf||50||Catch the tube to London Bridge and find your way here. It's not just a market and street food.pubs and restaurants surround the area. The street food is of course excellent - ate Ethiopian this time - so delicious. Walked round the stalks sampling the wares , cheese shops to die for.so much to chose from but only so much you can . ||August 27, 2015
lucamoche||50||This is a very nice spot in London.Borough Market is a strongly touristic attraction super crowdy expecially on Saturday.. Basically you'll find many small stations where you can taste many different kind of food for a reasonable price.You'll find cuisine from all over the world and also nice products local and none.||August 27, 2015
Limclair||40||So we were looking for the Globe Theatre and our trusty TripAdvisor map took us to the Globe restaurant here. We were pleasantly surprised as this place is vibrant. Lots of things to do and see. Tonnes of people walking around. We did notice that a lot of the vendors shut down quite early (than expected) so your best case is to go here during the day or late afternoon.||August 27, 2015
Simon Y||50||We visited this Market 3 years ago and were very impressed by the great variety of food available and the atmosphere. We went again and with no disappointment, we had similar feeling this time. Whilst enjoyed wandering around to see the fresh fruits and juice, seafood, various kinds of beverages and hot food from different parts of the world, we had also tried delicious sausages and different kinds of cheese where the traders were very willing to offer and explain. We also noticed that there were more sitting places than 3 years ago. A great place to have lunch and spend a relax afternoon! The Southwark Cathedral is just around the corner and worth a visit if have time. A place that we would surely come again!||August 27, 2015
peachesTreharris||50||We visited on a hot day so the crowds were out in force but it was easy enough to make your way through. There is a wide selection of food to suit all tastes and pockets. I had a really tasty halloumi and veg burger on a cabbage leaf (not vegetarian just fancied the sound of it!), husband had a Cornish Pasty, which turned out to be a bit dry and rest had lamb burgers, great place to taste food from most parts of the world. Worth a visit.||August 27, 2015
Irene G||50||This market is easy to get to on the Tube, close to a number of other attractions like the Clink prison, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre and the Tate Modern and worth it just for the food. Of the many tasty looking places we could have purchased lunch food, we chose La Tua Pasta. The samples were mouth-watering and my gorgonzola, walnut ravioli the best pasta I've ever eaten. Other stalls in the market had some amazing looking breads, desserts, paella, local and French cheeses, and Jamaican food, to name a few. Since this is a covered market, we enjoyed it on a very rainy day. ||August 26, 2015
JG-Bayern||50||Great market just south of the Tower Bridge with lots of stalls. Many different foods. Perfect place for lunch for the family or a group- everybody can choose what they like. ||August 26, 2015
LEO C||50||I love this place. The best steak and shrooms in town. I really liked this market, all so fresh, looking so tasty, just a perfect heaven.||August 26, 2015
mickey1991||50||We have visited London a lot but we never made it to the Borough Market and when we did on this trip we found it to be a very pleasant surprise. This market is where farmers, artisan bakers and cheesemakers bring their best to the public. We were very impressed with what we saw and the large variety of products for sale. This is a very interesting place out of the ordinary for people who enjoy quality food and well worth a visit. The market is easy to find, right off the tube at London Bridge and it's also a great place to have lunch.||August 26, 2015
bethld60||50||Called in for breakfast,food and coffee were great,lovely and fresh,service was good,called in later at around 6pm,really hot day,had a lovely pot of tea and the most delicious tomato and cheese on toast.||August 26, 2015

ameraroundtheworld||50||I tried food that I never imagined existed, and I wasn't disappointed once. Food prices are extremely reasonable here too, and so worth it. Close to the tube too! Lots of small, organic, and sustainable options. Come and explore, spend a whole day eating!||August 26, 2015
alfies||50||I live locally but if you are visiting London it is a must! Such a fantastic atmosphere and vibe about this place. Plenty of different wonderful food and drink items to try and purchase. Book a table at any of the restaurants to make a whole day out, you won't be disappointed. Remember to visit early as it gets really busy.||August 26, 2015
John S||50||A very quaint, quirky, beautiful, bizarre and yet so English place to visit on the London Docs, not far from the London Bridge and the Shard building. Some great bars and food stalls. Totally recommended||August 26, 2015
Roam588339||40||We went there on Saturday, it was very busy, I really wish I had multiple stomach for all the lovely food! We really enjoyed our visit and would definitely go again! ||August 26, 2015
flyhermes||40||The best market in London. All food and drinks experience is amazing. Every time I discover something new in this market. It's better to go starving and during the week as in the weekend it can be busy. Bring cash as it's more easy to buy. I recommend the stands: parmesan, the spritzer, jams, Spanish chorizo sandwiches, the truffles.||August 26, 2015
Giacomina63||50||the most AMAZING food experience on earth.. we had a croccodile burger and zebra on a skewer, honestly what don't they sell! ||August 25, 2015

leeboyz2015||50||Based on quality Food and Drinks The smells greet you at the street food area, so much to try and taste spoilt for choice. The fresh veg selections look like garden shows the way they are laid out. The produce and goods are a little more expensive than you may be used to but the quality is there. After 4:00pm ish they start to run out or pack up so best visited in the mornonig. We combined our visit with lunch time for the street food. All just stunning.||August 24, 2015
T0urist7||50||Borough Market is a fashionable and trendy place to buy food and it is a part of London history. The fabulous Art Deco buildings, trendy pubs and cafes and unique atmosphere make Borough Market very special. No wonder you could see Borough Market in Harry Potter film (Prisoner of Azkaban) and in Bridget Jones Diary.Borough Market operates on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 10am to 5pm, Fridays from 10am to 6pm, and Saturdays from 8 am to 5 pm. The wholesale market operates on all weekday mornings from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m.The market is located on Southwark Street and Borough High Street on the southern end of London Bridge.I mentioned it is a part of London history. Market itself claims to have existed since 1014 "and probably much earlier”. The fabulous buildings were designed and built in the second half of XIX century and an entrance designed in the Art Deco style in 1932.||August 24, 2015

Dec913||40||This was always on the list of things to do when we visited London, and it was worth it.With food around every corner, and everything we tried being delicious, this is one market I wish was on my doorstep. I though it would be bigger than it actually was after everything I had read about it, but no they just manage to have everything well organised and fitted in. I'll be coming back to this one.||August 24, 2015
Belinda M||50||Best place in London for food, coffee and fresh produce, went a couple of times while I was in London absolutely loved it.||August 24, 2015

tallgaloot||40||Wish I could have spent more time here. There seems to always be a market going here, so always something to see. But there are days when the market is fully operating, so check online to see what days are actually the best to come by. We were by on an off-day, but didn't get to stay long because we were on a walking tour. Would have liked to come back and try some of the food being sold here.||August 23, 2015
Lindsay S||50||I remember when this just started to revive, only open friday and Saturday mornings and the only place in London I could get a red delicious apple. I am so happy to see that it is thriving. Wander here first and grab a bit to eat, tons of options anything from vegetarian asian street food to Scotch eggs and Venison burgers, and a drink and then wander around Southwark along the Thames to the South Bank, that is my idea of a great day out.||August 22, 2015
Rob C||50||I love Borough Market! The crowds, the smells, the great food - it is all great! You can find plenty of fun and different food ready to eat or pick up the ingredients to make just about anything!Easy to get to from London Bridge.This visit we had a duck wrap and a grilled cheese, both quite tasty. We also picked up some turkish delight, baklava, and a brownie. Yum!||August 22, 2015
Juberry||50||I totally loved everything about this place! There was the most amazing choice of food and drink from around the world and everyone was so happy to let you try samples. The atmosphere was friendly and vibrant and I think it's a must for anyone visiting London. Amazing place!||August 22, 2015
LondonTravelLady||40||Borough Market buzzes with frantic energy from early on a Saturday morning to later afternoon selling everything from fresh produce, kangaroo burgers, organic wine and some of the most gorgeous looking cakes and treats they really are very hard to resist!!It is well worth battling the tourists to enjoy the sights, sounds and smell from this organic market in London. Join the queue at Monmouth for coffee before sitting down on the pavement with freshly made food from one of the many stalls or get away from the crowds by ducking into one of the restaurants in and around the market.Definitely worth a visit even if it is only to people watch!||August 22, 2015
Stu H||40||What a suprise find, and a lovely variety of foods to eat. Tried ethiopian food, spicey but lovely. Will be back again.||August 22, 2015

Sars R||40||Borough Market is a wonderful mix of produce and products from all over Europe. The food is fresh and reasonably priced, and the atmosphere joyful. If you're looking for knock - off chanel, this isn't that kind of market, but if you're looking for a way to.engage with the locals over good food and get a glimpse into local life make sure to make Borough Market a priority. ||August 21, 2015

Marion R||50||We came across this market after a visit to The Shard. What an amazing place, I loved it. Placed in the middle of a very busy area, jammed with food stalls that had a massive array of street food of all varieties. If you are a foodie a great place to go, wander, look and observe all that is going on. We did not eat anything as we were going for a meal but there was certainly loads of choice.If you happen to be in the area it is an absolute must see.||August 21, 2015

Gareth G||50||Having worked close to Borough market we felt at home. Spending a lazy Sunday morning, walking through all of the fab food sellers is a great past time. The smells of the cooking food and the people-watching on demand make this a fun and free way to experience modern, cool London. ||August 21, 2015
Nidhi_onroad||50||We visited Borough Market on our way to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. Am so glad we did ! Till then had no idea about such a place in London. Its a gourmet food market with shops selling stuff like olives, all kinds of cheese, different oils, wines, fruits, meat, flowers etc. There is section with food kiosks stalls selling all kinds of food like chinese, italian, even gujarati food. The whole market is pretty and charming. There are also a couple of wine bars/cafes inside. ||August 20, 2015
JKerr88||40||Went here for lunch at the weekend, there are a fantastic number of stalls. Italian cheeses and salami, German bread and sausages, cookies and cakes galore. Most stalls will give you a small taste of things to help you decide what you want to buy. There are also lots of options for different foods for lunch, burgers, hog roast, Chinese etcA great experience. ||August 20, 2015
1967fitz||50||This market is an amazing place full of such amazing food and drink. Could spend weeks enjoying it. Only thing to be aware of its popular with pick pockets so as long as you take care you will only find it positive.||August 20, 2015
alfred h||50||Visited on a Tuesday when there didn't seem to be as many stalls open as our last visit, but still enough choice to satisfy anyone. If you have nothing else you must try the cream doughnuts from 'Bread Ahead'.||August 20, 2015
H6136IEmichaels||50||I work at Borough Market at the moment so know all the ins and outs!! Must try the grilled cheese sandwiches, the seafood wraps, the coffee at Monmouth, the ginger pig pork n Stilton sausage roll, the oysters! The kangaroo or crocodile burgers!! The list goes on. Take a first date to wow him or her. There will never be an awkward silence as there's so much to see, do and taste!! And you MUST try the mushroom pâté!! ||August 20, 2015
gatekeeper10||50||If you are a goodie then you cannot miss this. By London Bridge Station, the sights and smells of this market are fantastic. All tastes catered for and many bargains to be had. Each unique stall has much to offer, fresh bread, olives, cheese, you name it, you can probably get it. If you are hungry ,why not buy your lunch and then sit by the river and admire the views. superb , the market is free to enter and under cover. Can get busy at times||August 20, 2015
Julia F||50||Atmosphere brilliant and the massive array of street food was incredible. Be prepared to have your sense assaulted by smells and tastes! We ate breakfast here every day. Fabulous breads, amazing coffee and juices. Definitely a must if you love foods from all round the world.||August 20, 2015
Herman_wang||50||The moment I arrived there, and enter the gate, OMG, almost all food stalls smell soooo good, all about food , so many variants, from raw fresh foods , vegetables , fresh fruits, TRUFFLES, many kind of CHEESE to all grilled and cooked SCALLOPS , sandwich, RoastPork , sooooo Yummmmy !!! i always have a weakness about great food quality , Love Love Love !!! And some more , I saw sooo many cakes and pastries too, and As Ialways say "there's always a place for dessert" hahaha and I can find some asian foods here too, such as : indian, chinese, japanese, vietnamese , etc ... Bottom line : this market is very good for you who are looking for fresh inhredients to cook, and it's very good to whom looking for a ready served foods !!! Worth to visit !!! ||August 19, 2015
KazDaz01||50||Have been to London so many times but Borough Market has passed me by...until now! Fantastic place, very busy, lots of lovely food stalls, fresh produce and great variety.Could have stuffed ourselves silly but settled on some salt and pepper squid which was delicious. Can't recommend highly enough ||August 19, 2015
MichaelF233||30||Unfortunately our trip to London was from Sunday to Tuesday and therefore only some of the food market was open. This is a real shame as the small number of stalls that were open left you feeling frustrated that you hadn't seen it in its full glory. Make sure you go under the bridge to the back of the market as this at first glance is not clear and you could miss lots of stalls.Would like to visit again when everything is open.||August 19, 2015
tatiana118||50||This is the best market I have ever seen for a choice of foods with a difference and a great atmosphere. The market only concentrates on food - to buy and take home such as fruit and vegetables but also a great range of food to take away and eat in containers.Wonderful choices of cheeses breads and other gastronomic delights such as paellas,sausages.If you happen to be here, be sure to stop by Southwark Cathedral which is right around the corner.||August 19, 2015
Carrie_yeung||50||The market is huge and I'm sure you will find something you like, a lot of shops selling cheese, ham, juice, fruit, chocolate and also you can order hot food like burger, rice, pasta and sausage! Make sure you come here with an empty stomach in order you can try as many as possible.||August 19, 2015
vikabresp||50||Great for a real british food experience. Try the fish and ships at Fish! But be aware of pickpockets.||August 19, 2015
Tilly B||40||This place is great to wander around & pick up some lovely food from around the globe but unfortunately it has lost some of its real feel and charm since many of the original traders have moved so it's a little more touristy now. But still a great place to go, try some new things, have a coffee and soak up the hustle & bustle atmosphere.||August 19, 2015
Airz K||50||Do not miss! Great street food from the doghnuts to the fresh juice, yum yum yum! Great vibe! Awesome!@instabuilt ||August 19, 2015
otolith||50||There is everything you could want here: from market produce to the finished product. Coming here for lunch is a treat. You can have duck wraps, paella, wurst, pastries, curry... It's endless. For those visiting London this should not be missed. It is a both foodie heaven and traditional farmer's market wrapped into one. Fantastic. Closed on Sundays. ||August 18, 2015
CarrieK192||50||If you love food go to this market. Their website is good and shows the hours and basic layout of this market neighborhood. Try scotch eggs or an amazingly fabulous pie from Pieminister. They have a free range chicken and leek that will make you wish you lived in London. There are several good stalls for vegetarian delights but I did not notice any vegan options. Things change so maybe they'd have vegan on other days. There are places to buy French salt....white truffles and British cheeses of all types. If you're staying in a flat or hotel with a fridge or cooking facilities this is your place to stock up on high quality meats fruits and veggies. ||August 18, 2015
Stephen S||40||A South Bank location near Southwark Cathedral means there is plenty to do and see around Borough Market. It is still a shopping market but the real attractions are the range of food stalls, bars and cafes. There are not too many seating areas but if you find a spot it is a great way to rest and recuperate for a while with food and a drink or two.||August 18, 2015
dancing-baker||50||Love walking around Borough Market to try the food or just look at them. Free tasting for cheese, olive oils, truffle oil, jams and chutney, sausages etc. A Bread Ahead has fluffy filled doughnuts, salted caramel doughnut is to die for. Fresh oysters from Richard Haward shop. Free cooking demos on Thursdays and Fridays 12.30-2pm. It's very busy on Saturdays.||August 18, 2015
Jitka H||40||It is great place not only for foodies:-) Just smell and taste different dishes - british or even oriental. It is realy nice and interesting place, but very busy, too busy for a lunch!||August 18, 2015
Moaken||50||Where do I start? For all your food requirements and more this place has it all! For the right price of course - it don't come cheap! However, it is dripping in quality. Even a simple almond croissant tastes like heaven in your mouth. There is street food from all the continents (well maybe not Antarctica!), endless cake stalls, pretentious beer etc this place has the lot! I can't go all the time as I am not made of money but I treat myself big time when I do! ||August 17, 2015
greedigirl||50||If you love food and produce, you must go. Has a wonderful range of food, both produce and cooked food. We just moved from stall to stall, grazing on the offerings. I've been here on different occasions, but on my last occasion, I really enjoyed the goat wrap. You can give the 3 scallops for £5.50 a miss, unless you absolutely love scallops. They were a bit rubbery. But the cheese selection. Don't get carried away and buy too much because there are quite a few, and you might end up with more than you intended to buy. Don't forget the shops around the area (the cheese shop at Neal's Yard!). Even if you aren't planning on buying fresh produce you can just go there for a meal and enjoy the vibe. Try to go early (by 9.30am) on a Saturday morning, to get a nice vibe without too many people. By around 11am, it gets quite crowded.||August 17, 2015
UmOmran||40||I visited Borough market after my daughter recommend it, it is nice place to walk and try different kind of foods and fresh juices ||August 17, 2015
LeahB798||50||Super Cool place to visit while in London. All of the vendors are amazing. This place is so large and intricate. A must attend for the food stands, there is so much selection!! I recommend you walk around to see all of your options before committing to what you want to eat. Better to go with a group and sample multiple dishes!||August 17, 2015
TPshow||40||The market is great, selling good cheese, French "charcuterie", bread and wine, among others. Also some good vegetables and fruits. And if you're hungry, you can get some burgers or fish&chips from one of the street food sellers.||August 17, 2015
Nils K||50||We really enjoyed visiting this market. Great selection of interesting food such as cheese, meat, wine, tea, honey etc. ||August 16, 2015
LukeGilham||50||Borough market is great fun! It incorporates individuality with great in your face salesmanship! People selling their own stuff, giving out free samples of their own food and drink and everyone having fun! It's just a great atmosphere for couples and family's, whether small children or teenagers, everyone will love it. Freshly made in front of you piping hot, or baked and still smelling beautiful! I hope this review has helped. Be warned, you may find yourself having breakfast, lunch and dinner in there! Hahah if you do go I hope you have as much fun as I do when you go.||August 16, 2015
Tammy J||50||Lovely place easy to find x smells great so many different stalls x Not a place to go if you are hungry there's so many things to choose from x ||August 16, 2015
GemPepp||40||A fantastic place to try any and all sorts of food. A must visit if in London, can't wait to go again soon.||August 16, 2015
framboise_blues||50||Borough Market is THE place to be for food lovers! Theres so much to see and so much to taste, one's stomach is simply not enough to try everything! Some must-trys:Grilled hand dived scallops with bacon bits - 5.50 poundsFresh shucked oysters - 5.50 poundsVarious fruits and berriesVarious cakes and pastriesSalt beef sandwichDuck Confit SandwichFreshly made pasta||August 16, 2015
beachbuddy10||40||If you're walking, aim for the Shard and you will end up very near to the Market entrance. Go late morning and graze your way around the fascinating choice of free samples, snacks and takeaways.We paid a visit to some old friends at the Shellseekers stall for their excellent hand-dived Dorset scallops. Then collected portions of Malaysian curry and paella and hunted for seats. Suitably refreshed we ended up at a Spanish produce store and stocked up on olive oil, rice and saffron.Many bars and restaurants surround the market and there is a whole "street" of fast food vendors. Come with an appetite and stay all day.||August 16, 2015
Sdwoo||40||I often walk through here and find that Friday through Sunday are the best, but busiest days. It is a superb place to wander and pick up snacks from the various food stalls. We had been walking a fair bit this day and decided that we wanted to sit down to eat, but it was still enjoyable to walk around and we bought a few things for later. ||August 16, 2015
Océane R||40||A nice market with so many different kind of food ! You can find bread, honey, cakes, sandwiches, ... It was really a good time, and the food is really good ! Furthermore, the atmosphere we can find there is really nice.||August 16, 2015
Sara L||40||Really busy market with wide range of artisan food stalls and eateries. Best day to visit is apparently Wednesday if you don't like being jostled, or go on Saturday if you enjoy the bustle of crowds. Enjoyed indulging in tasting foods we wouldn't normally have access to at home eg white truffle oil and specialist cheeses. I'd do my weekly fresh food shop here if it didn't mean a 3 hour round trip by hi-speed train!||August 15, 2015
Pat R||40||This market is an absolute delight, so many tasty things on offer and knowledgeable stall holders. My tip would be to get there early if you're going at the weekend, after about 11.30 you really can't move! ||August 15, 2015
tripsAAA||50||As a foodie, I was looking forward to Borough Market and it did not disappoint. Endless stalls of cheap, amazing takeaway food in a lively atmosphere. We had a ton of stuff, but there were definitely some standouts. The bacon topped scallops at Shellseekers were a highlight. The venison burger at Westcountry Venison was outstanding as well. For dessert we had some great filled doughnuts from Bread Ahead. Just outside the market was Neils Yard Dairy, where you can speak with the welcoming staff and sample any or all of their many varieties of cheese. We came here for lunch on day one and loved it so much we came back again on day two!||August 15, 2015
GeorgesShoe||50||Another of London's 'Hidden Treasures', this gem of a market opens out before you and branches out into many directions.Diverse, welcoming and with a definite 'buzz', a myriad of appealing aromas hit you as you wander amongst the varied stalls - if you don't find something to satisfy your taste buds here, I'll eat my ... Salt-Beef on Rye Sandwich - with pickles, salad, mustard and blow-torched melted cheese on top! Sensational!This is not just somewhere to grab something quick to eat, but a whole sensory experience.Superb - I will be back! ||August 15, 2015
Véronique B||50||Nice place and perfect to tast lots of different food and drinks. Quite expensive. Perfect place to start promenade along the Thames.||August 15, 2015
rememiranda||50||We live in Tower Bridge and we love to go there on Saturdays. It is always packed but we really like to walk around, get some samples, see what they are selling, smell the fresh fruit, have some lunch! It is really lovely there.Also, from 4.30 on they start selling what is left of the day much cheaper so we always buy some fruits and veggies there. So fresh and tasty!||August 14, 2015
venicegirl05||40||Good people watching and great food stalls to try but was very crowded. Don't go on the weekend. Walk around first before getting into a line.||August 14, 2015
MsDeboo||50||In spite of many previous visits to London I have never been to this market under the London Bridge rail lines. A great variety of foods and ingredients to either eat on the spot or take away. Great cheese stalls including 'Drunken Cheese' aged in alcohol and a variety of locally sourced cheeses. Fresh fish stalls one of which served the best and freshest calamari I've ever eaten. Yes, it is touristy but for a reason - Londoners also enjoy the variety here. Worthwhile, but beware if you're on a diet!! ||August 14, 2015
MariaAgnes||40||Very atmospheric market. Lots of interesting stalls. Bit expensive though. No your everyday kind of market.||August 14, 2015
Annnonymousss||50||This market is amazing. Especially for people who love food. I'd definitely advice anyone to go there around lunch time to pick up some nice streetfood. Lots of choices for vegetarians as well. You'll find things like; burgers, fresh pasta, falafel wraps, pad thai, curries and more. Don't forget a dessert! There are loads of stands that sell chocolates, icecream, sweets, pastries, cakes, muffins, pies, brownies etc. Next to all of that you'll find tradors that sell spices, homegrown chemical free veggies and fruits, raw honey, olives, fresh baked bread and more!||August 14, 2015
10Viviana||40||The place looks good and it has a good selection of foods and stands. However, be prepared with cash, otherwise you would be queueing at the surrounding ATMs. It was very, but very crowded and if you prepare for standing in line 20 min for a bite, it is a nice place to visit. I would re-visit.||August 13, 2015
lampshade1635509||40||this market has great atmosphere,real hustle and bustle, plenty of stalls selling various foods from chinese, pies, cheeses, olives, hams . it also sells gifts and novelty items found it a bit expensive but it is a tourist attraction,nice coffee shop serving quality coffee,a couple of pubs.also near to the thames just a short walk||August 13, 2015
Eliz B||30||This food market is impressive, but it is crowded with tourists. Perhaps it would be better off season. ||August 13, 2015
JohnCarter||40||Feels like old London. A really lively place with lots of food available. Fascinating to see the mix and new and old with this market so near to the ultra modern Shard.||August 13, 2015
Ironside46||50||This has to be one of the best markets if you enjoy cooking to buy your ingredients, such a massive variety of the very best produce and also has some great street food on the way in and around the market.||August 13, 2015
Stefan H||50||So many flavours under one roof. And exceptional drink accompaniments. Artisans everywhere you look. A must visit for Londoners and out of towners... you might get lucky as I did, with family visitors in tow - a full on craft beer festival. Schwing!!!||August 13, 2015
Ro11WithIt||40||We went on a Thursday afternoon when the market was bustling. We bought lots of fruits and vegetables. We also had dinner - some at the Indian booth, some at the Fish!Kitchen. It was a festive and fun market. We also went back through on a Sunday afternoon when it was closed and realized how temporary all those vendor booths are!! A section of the Harry Potter Knight Bus was filmed here, too.||August 12, 2015
1357246||40||Great atmosphere, some great street food, lovely just to walk through all the stalls. Mostly all kinds of special food, some home made, some straight from the farm. Make plans to eat in the market and just watch all the different people who are coming and going. M||August 12, 2015
donnaferguson4||50||There is plenty of food for all tastes, and produce to buy too. It's better to go on certain days as not all stalls are open, check website before hand to avoid disappointment.||August 12, 2015
Caw20||50||I have been visiting Borough Market for years and feel that it is no longer a market but now a luxury food fare and even more reason to go. Go hungry so you can nibble all the free tasters and the buy some excellent food for lunch. Would recommend some of the cheeses, a great selection from local producers along with some great other food finds. A nice adventure. Don't forget to have a look in Southwark Cathedral one of the best in London ||August 12, 2015
RickX01||50||I just love this place . Every time I come to London I have to visit. I love the variety of regional foods and the choices you have to eat in the area. There are quick eats, sit down restaurants and just pubs as well. There is a coffee shop there which does great coffee, but expect a small queue. Well worth a visit if you like going to food markets.||August 12, 2015
Paolo R||30||This is London-for-tourists at its best. If you are prepared to pay for overpriced food, go ahead.There is a nice variety of stalls with an incredible variety of products. Some stalls are worth a visit, but the majority are way too expensive.||August 12, 2015
pianogrl||50||Big market with lots of food stands, most of it is covered, and there are some public tables for eating (usually crowded so its not sure you'll get a spot) I like to take my friends here for lunch when they are visiting. I prefer to enter from the London Bridge and to exit by the river Bankside for a walk. Very diverse food: indian, spanish, italian, turkish, french, all you want really, just make sure you have cash.||August 12, 2015
morganel82||50||Awesome experience today at the Borough Market! So many kinds of food to choose from that it was difficult to pick something. But what a treat it was when we did choose the pad Thai and because we couldn't pick one we had a burg-ito as well. Definitely go on an empty stomach and be prepared to eat to your hearts content! I highly recommend a visit for a meal and some ingredients to take away!||August 12, 2015
WTH9||50||stumbled upon this by exploring local area around hotel. tons of fresh local produce, cheese and other foods and such. def worth the walk through. a couple pubs inside as well. has a feel of leaving the city while inside.||August 12, 2015
HillzyB||40||Great place for people who want something more than just fish and chips. We stumbled upon this place when we were going to the London Bridge and it was so worth it. We walked in and the smells were AMAZING. There were a variety of food stands, vegetable stands, meat stands and more. We went on an off day so not all the stalls were open but there were still plenty open and lots of options. Go early for lunch and then you can walk it off later as you go see the London Bridge.||August 12, 2015
weeksie501||40||Fantastic place....average sandwich/ burger is between £5 and £8. Definitely needs a few visits to make the most of it. My only advice would be to almost go with a plan about what you are looking for as there are so many things to tempt you!||August 12, 2015
Vikasvij_2004||40||Wonderful opportunity for us the very foodie family to walk around and try every thing. Wonderful pasta, calamari, paella, rizo roll, oysters and some drinks to wash ever thing down. Wow what a feast||August 12, 2015
John L||50||We visited here last week when we went up the Shard. The market is a well known historical site and is a must for all foodies visiting London. Get there by exiting Borough on the Northern Line tube. Many different national dishes and a great atmosphere. Buy ready made food to eat, or take specialist breads and cheeses home along with oodles of fruit and veg. Ladies will be very interested in the fashion items alongside the food. Next door is the famous Southwark Cathedral, make sure you visit this too. You'll be pleased you came to this side of town.||August 12, 2015
KatieSunflower||40||Best time to go is in the morning before the crowds get too busy - Saturday lunchtime is pretty manic, especially if you get good weather! The atmosphere is always brilliant and go hungry because there is so much (good value) street food to try!Only negative is BUSY crowds!||August 12, 2015
Andrew C||40||I'm a frequent visitor to London, but had never ventured into the institution that is Borough Market. Once you have walked, sniffed and tasted your way around this sprawling experience of food and drink, you will never again want to return to your local supermarket. The range of produce on offer here is staggering, and the street food sellers serve up the world on a plate for you. We visited on a Saturday morning, and it was not so much busy as a seething mass of humanity! But whilst this slowed down our progress, it merely added to the fantastic atmosphere.||August 11, 2015
625RL||50||Not to be missed. One of my favorite food markets. You can get food from every continent. Great diversity of produce, fruits, meats, cheeses, snacks, drinks, and much more. We could have eaten here every meal. Favorites include the empanadas, chorizo sandwiches, Ethiopian food, pasta place and fruit stands. Would have stayed longer if there was a place to sit.||August 11, 2015
bounceyman||40||Bussling market. Lots of food, tourists and atmosphere. Great produce available, would probably still shop here if I were a local||August 11, 2015
Laura_TravelTheWorld||50||This is probably one of the best markets I have ever been to. There is food from all over the world! ||August 11, 2015
Mel C||50||We used to always visit here when lived in London, really enjoyable and so much tasty things to choose from. You can then walk along the river which is a great walk with lovely views. Does not take long to get to Tate Gallery...Love the Borough market always a buzz about the place. Get a taste of real London.||August 11, 2015
Em131313||50||This is a fantastic place for street food. Every kind of cuisine, from giant paellas, Malaysian curries, Indian food, Thai food, Soul food, fresh burgers (even some made with venison), hog roasts, bbqs, vegetarian food, pastries, breads, cakes, coffees, freshly squeezed juices and much much more! You could not fail to find something you like, the only problem is making a choice as it all looks and smells so delicious. There are also lovely stalls with speciality food to buy, like cured meats and cheeses, as well as wonderful looking butchers, fishmongers and green grocers.Many stalls offer you tasters before you buy which we really enjoyed.I took my kids here for lunch today (on our way to the Unicorn theatre) and would thoroughly recommend it. Do arrive early though as when we returned, walking through at about 2.30pm many stalls had sold out and were closing up.||August 11, 2015
Jefferson G||50||Like many people, my initial thoughts of London attractions went to Big Ben, Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, etc. Those are fine, I'm sure, but treat yourself to Borough Market before shelling out major pounds for those other places.We walked to Borough Market from our hotel near Tower of London - only 20 minutes. All I really knew was that it was a big farmers market. That's true, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The first thing we noticed was the variety of goods - not just fruits and veggies but meat, fish, cheese (lots of cheese), baked goods, beverages, etc. Cold or hot, fresh or prepared, there's something for everyone.The second thing we noticed was the quality and presentation. Sometimes in big public markets with big reputations, you come away thinking it's all mediocre and overpriced. Not here. I grabbed a piece of baklava that was among the best I've had. My wife treated herself to two macaroons - earl grey and vanilla - that she would have paid 3-4 times as much for in the U.S. We also paid five pounds for five small jars of jams and jellies, the flavors of which we would never find at home. Oh, and there are a few pubs right there as well.Bottom line: We loved it so much that morning that we swung back through for a snack late that same afternoon - and this was when we had only one day in town. Between this great experience and the overall location, there's really no excuse for not going to market while in London.||August 11, 2015
dai44||40||If you go here hungry , it might take quite a while to go around ! The various types and flavours of food on offer really are great and your'e certainly spoilt for choice and the smell of all the different dishes and treats will certainly tingle your tastebuds. I love to try new foods and was pleasantly surprised at just how extensive the range was and the samples on offer introduced me to some wonderful new tastes.Go there and I am certain you'll leave with with some very happy memories.||August 11, 2015
lornad358||40||Visited here on our way home from London and very glad I did. It's food heaven. Loved the location and all the market stalls. Tried some tasty street food and even bought some bread to bring home to wales which was absolutely delicious. The brownies were also yummy. Would have bought so much more if I wasn't travelling so far by bus. Worth a visit if you love food. ||August 11, 2015
Rhondayvous K||40||Our family visited Borough Market for a late lunch on a Saturday and felt a bit overwhelmed by the crowds, both tourists and locals, elbowing through the market for lunch, produce, cheeses, pastries, etc...everything was very fresh and delicious. We shared a wild boar sausage, pot stickers, Pad Thai and Turkish delight from various food stalls. Families with young children (esp in strollers) or folks in wheelchairs may find it challenging to navigate, so perhaps come when they first open.||August 10, 2015
jsvalen||40||An array of all kinds of interesting and delicious food - a sight to behold! The only problem was that we were there on a Sat in August and it was so crowded you could hardly walk through, let alone find a place to sit and eat. None the less, I bought some delicious Turkish delights! I'd like to go again off season or on a week day.||August 10, 2015
eandkpowell||50||This market is amazing--more shops and stalls than you could hope to see in one visit, and so many fantastic options for food and drink. Monmouth coffee offers an incredible pour-over, and a maze of fresh fruit & vegetable stands, bakeries, and street food have plenty for every visitor.||August 10, 2015
Pathfinder809316||50||We enjoyed our visit to Borough Market. It was not as large as we had imagined, but the atmosphere and the selection of food on offer made up for this.||August 10, 2015
Jeap12||20||Covent garden like is what I expected to be this place like.Got there around 4, almost empty, dirty, a few food stalls. Very disappointing. ||August 10, 2015
EKYL||40||I would highly recommend this place for tourists, and those who enjoy eating! A perfect place with a busy environment. Free samples everywhere, and there are different types of foods available. From juices, to cheeses, to scallops and Paella. They have everything.The Bread Ahead Ltd donuts are a must try! They should be located near the entrance of the market. Highly recommended coming here for nibbles and a good time.||August 10, 2015
542joc||40||Borough market is a busy, food-y, slightly trendy London market. If you dislike these things you won't enjoy it. If you love any of these things you will. I've found great foods and teas there, love the atmosphere, sometimes want to kick the crowds, especially at the weekend. And definitely buy some lunch while you're there.||August 9, 2015
529arnes||40||Having worked in the area for some years BM used to be the place to go for a lunch bite. I now went back being afraid that the last years 'updates' may have destroyed the spirit of the marked. Well maybe it has, as it is now (of course) less of a local neighborhood marked and more a tourist attraction. However considering it's location and many great stalls I think that would have happened changes or not. Yes there are more tourists (but is that not just great for London?) but there are still masses of very interesting stalls offering food and other produce many of which are not easily found elsewhere. Interestingly I bought smoked Spanish paprika not much more expensive than my local supermarket price in Andalucia - and Monmouth Coffee is still going strong!||August 9, 2015
SallyChh||50||We arrived at 8am and parked in the small market carpark, when the Market was setting up and it was quiet and lovely to see the fresh produce being set out. The quality of food on sale was wonderful, beautiful fruit and vegetables and great breads, cheeses and olives! It got busier as the time went on but not too busy. The traders were helpful and very friendly. It was an amazing place to visit the quality of the produce will make you look at the food in the supermarket with different eyes! Small tip go when you are hungry, there is so much to eat freshly cooked.||August 9, 2015
Danny F||40||Visited the market this morning with my 16 year old daughter. Plenty of fresh food stalls. Did find that some of the stalls selling freshly cooked food a bit expensive. Maria's cafe was also closed. Apart from that really good||August 8, 2015
samuelsings||50||We walked a fair distance before reaching Borough Market. It was lovely! We bought some spices before treating ourselves to some great delights! We had the hotdogs and pork knuckles. Absolute yums!!!||August 8, 2015
moseyjoy||50||Enjoyed our time here with interesting finds from all over places. Bought cheap flat peaches at a steal, tried oysters fresh and they have different yummy food to savor or fresh fruits and vegetables and poultry to bring home(:||August 7, 2015
OmanRob||50||Wandered round here this morning and loved the place, Berger seen as much high quality food and produce in one place ever.We had brought a packed lunch but still bought some cheese and peaches as they were so good - my advice would be bring a cool-bag and stock up here then find some shady park to enjoy your fair.Rob||August 7, 2015
zennamk||40||I love Borough Market! I had a great time exploring stalls offering various products for purchase: flowers, fruit, spices, etc. There was a stall selling a variety of curry dishes and it was great. It was still early when we went but I could not resist ordering ordering.||August 6, 2015
Mark J||50||Love this place bring your appetite from the gourmet diver scallops ,the venison burgers, Malaysian curry.,Truffles, cheese and sausages. It's a DONT miss||August 6, 2015
ClaireH44444||40||Great market, didn't expect such an assault on my taste buds. Food from every corner of the globe with tasters from many stalls. Wish I lived closer, would visit every day.||August 6, 2015
Felipe D||50||Nice place to stop by while sightseeing in London. The market have several and interesting options of food and drinks, mostly. There are very tasty things to try and you can also find a nice souvenir eventually. Just take care with the working hours. In late afternoon most stands are closed.||August 6, 2015
Laurence771||40||We had just had lunch in Camino a Spanish Tapas restaurant nearby and decided to walk up to Borough Market, the place is full of food stall, fresh fruit and vegetable stall, cheese stalks, butchers and so much more. The smells from the many varied food stalls was just so good if we hadn't of just eaten a large lunch we would have most certainly opted to each from one of the stalls.Very worth while visiting.||August 6, 2015
Didi1945||50||This market is easy to get to and worth every moment you spend there - we went twice, and we only had a week in London! But the variety is wonderful - the freshest of veg, fruit, fish, meat, bakery goods & patisserie, even including a kitchen shop and beautiful practical English pottery (well, it's from Jersey). Unusual vegetables like samphire, cobnuts in season, fabulous cheeses ... It's all there.||August 5, 2015
Marph||50||Came here part of a trip to London for a foodie weekend. It did not disappoint. We were like kids in a sweet shop, left with lots of bits and pieces and big smiles on our faces.Well worth the visit. Didn't mind the crowds. Wish we lived nearer so could regularly shop there.||August 5, 2015
Kate L||50||Even though it was pouring with rain it was still lots of fun and the food we tasted was really yummy!||August 5, 2015
Cathirene||50||Lots to see with a real buzz about the place. Quality things to buy unlike some of the other markets which are a bit downmarket. Good eating places||August 5, 2015
DesignandTravelGuide||50||You must go here with an empty stomach otherwise you will be lost! Amazing food stands from cheese, brean, fish, fruit, veg. And plenty of little restaurants and cafes to eat. Perfect for lunch and people watching!||August 5, 2015
Alain W||40||Borough markets on Saturdays is a foodie heaven, it’s a joy to visit. A little tip: To avoid the tourist crowds go early. Whether its’ picking ing up some meat from the Ginger Pig, Jamon from Brindisa next door, your morning coffee from Monmouth across the road, walk 10 metres down from Monmouth you will find Neal’s Yard Dairy for english cheeses, in summer a wide variety of english cherries will be available. Opposite Neal’s is the German delicatessen. All this before, one even enters the heart of the market itself. There is produce form Croatia, local ciders and beers, fruit and vegetable providores, French Comte for cheese and saucisson ranging from wild boar, truffle, walnut. Farm yard butters, seafood, breads. Our friends couldn’t understand why we wake up early then travel an hour instead of going to a Waitrose or Sainsbury to buy food to cook them dinner. Believe me it worth the effort. Just remember to go early on Saturday to avoid the crowds. Enjoy!||August 5, 2015
TravelGoddess86||50||This place has everything for foodies like me! Gourmet food galore and enough beer and wine to wash it all down with. I sat outside in front of the nearby cathedral. Cheese, meats, Asian cuisine, Indian curries...anything your heart desires, this market has. Come hungry, leave happy||August 4, 2015
OsideMom2three||30||Interesting assortment of foods in one place. Lots of cheeses, chocolate and hot foods for sale. Only downside is there is little to no places to sit down and eat if you purchase food at the market.||August 4, 2015
Peter A||40||Great foodbrilliant venue Loads of independent foodies All kinds of food and drinkTake your time and have a good look round before deciding on what to eat well worth a visit||August 4, 2015
kmtcupertino||50||Wonderful food stalls. I highly recommend the meat pies. The wild boar sausage was very tasty. The many flavors of Turkish Delight were a treat. There was a great selection of fresh fruit.||August 4, 2015
Mkayes||50||If you like excellent, fresh, well presented food of all kinds as well as friendly people, you must visit the Borough Market. It is extensive, covered so weather is not a problem, near bus and tube lines and a place that makes folks smile and want to linger and enjoy food as art. ||August 4, 2015
Travelling-Wolfgang||30||I visited the Borough Market twice this year. I loved it in January (5 points). Beautiful sunshine, walked around the various shops/market stands and had a good time exploring the market. Tasting various items. I had a good impression from all the stands there, quality product at ok prices.I visited again in July (1 point). Once again beautiful sunshine. But: Crowded beyond capacity. It was no fun at all walking around (or rather: being pushed around). I did not enjoy that at all. Would never go there again in July.So my tip: I you have the chance: Go there in the off season or shoulder season. You will enjoy it much more.||August 4, 2015
Louise P||40||Fantastic experience! Food from around the world; fresh produce both uncooked and cooked ready prepared to eat. Extremely busy but great atmosphere. Very difficult to get round with a buggy or wheelchair although not impossible - patience required! Some restaurants available if wanting to sit down, otherwise people sat where openings avaliable and standing eating and drinking. Well worth a visit, even if just passing through to get a feel of the hustle and bustle of diverse London. Definitely recommend! Scallops a must if you enjoy seafood!!! ||August 4, 2015
JoshGilbert||50||Great food, great vibe, definitely a "must do" when you're in London. Try the salted beef sandwiches and the oysters for sure.||August 3, 2015
twang54||40||If you decide to go to Borough Market it is impossible not to find a cuisine suited to your desires. From Pakistan to Spain, from China to Mongolia, an orgy of flavors, aromas, colors and sounds (not noise...) overwhelm you. Apparently the Borough Market may seem a chaotic suk, maybe the crowd of Saturday morning may scare you, but be aware that many chefs come here to buy the delicacies that use in their three stars Michelin restaurants. The vibrant atmosphere of this market will seduce you with its colors and flavors. Unforgettable was the rice noodles cooked in front of my eyes, but also the freshly baked bread, cheese, fruit, fish, a great food bonanza just a short walk from London Bridge Station.||August 3, 2015
sean b||50||Great place to walk through. Lots of food stalls for just about anything you can imagine. Make sure to walk all the way through and around the corners. I missed a very large section somehow... if you only see about 50 food stalls, then you missed a whole section!||August 3, 2015
Mari P||50||Always worth of visit! We had a lunch here, great pies! Lot of different food stalls. Very crowdy place in afternoon.||August 2, 2015
307cliver||40||Saturday lunchtime and the Market and the atmosphere was buzzing. Numerous food venues selling street food of high quality. Plenty of stalls selling good quality home produce.The old and new mix wonderfully making this a great tourist venue.I would thoroughly recommend coming here for a visit.||August 2, 2015
Mark B||50||Great place , the only problem , we went last saturday and was full of people , next time we will go during the week , anyway we had a great time !!!||August 2, 2015
KasSussex||50||Really good place for looking at and trying various foods. Wander around, enjoy the great variety of fish, veg, bread, cheese, olive oil etc etc. Choose some things to try from oysters (if they grab you), scallops (now you are talking), pizza, roast, fruit drinks. Most of all just ENJOY!||August 2, 2015
Greig H||50||My partner had never been to Borough market and I had been only the once and was eager to return. We had a fantastic day from tricking her into trying scotch bonnet jam to finding a really nice ham and buying loads to take back. If you like food and something a bit different this is the place for you. I can't really describe it, u just have to go see and enjoy! Wear trousers a size bigger u will need the extra room for the trip home! Don't hesitate go!!!!||August 2, 2015
BARRYBE||40||Have previous visited this vibrant market and once again not disappointed at all. Went on a Friday which was very busy. Excellent variety of fruit , vegetables and all types of other food. We had lunch at the market which consisted of two duck dishes and one hamburger., purchased from various stalls. All were good.There is a great atmosphere at this market with many people drinking beers etc (bought from the pubs ) outside in the streets.A great experience.||August 2, 2015
bakfung||50||The best food I have ever tasted! Burgers, oysters, cheese - suitable for everyone! Slightly pricey, but definitely worth giving it a shot. Gets a bit crowded, so go early. ||August 2, 2015
moneyfamily022||50||This place is a throng for foodie lovers.Selling everything from all around the world,the stall holders a friendly and knowledgable and all offer tastings.Fantastic smell on the way in.||August 1, 2015
Howard M||50||Wonderful high end market. Fresh fruit and vegetables, meats, oils, baked goods, etc. We purchased a wonderful "picnic" dinner and took it back to our hotel. There are numerous restaurants, we had lunch at Arabica Bar and Kitchen which was amazing. Highly recommend this as a place to see while in London.||August 1, 2015
Ingoiolo||40||Lovely variety of cuisines and excellent flavours and ingredients. Fantastic example of why London is such a great and unique melting pot of cultures and of how London has totally surprised its old 'English food is crap' fame and it has now become one of the food capitals of the worldWorth a visit, maybe avoid weekend lunch times||August 1, 2015
beyo43||50||a visit to Borough Market is a first class pass time for Saturday's mornings.Travel to London Bridge, a by product is a visit to the Shard and a stroll along the Thames in the Southwark district.The food market offers variety for all tastes and food and cooking skills and preferences.Make sure you skip breakfast before your visit. ,!!. The rest is your pleasure.||August 1, 2015
Psofronie2014||50||We came across of this market,by accident and so regretting we had lunch! We were amazed how big this market was,and crowded,but an amazing experience as we walking through,lovely food stalls and smells :)And i dont think we ve seen it all.Next time in London,it will be the top list to visit!||August 1, 2015
JElliot32||40||Borough market was highly recommended to us by an ex-pat during our recent stay in London. It was our first visit, and what a feast for the eyes it is - wonderful array of stalls selling cuisines from all over the world as well as providores of fruit and veg, cheese, meat etc. So, it is a proper market.However, it was quite overcrowded, even mid-week. And not cheap. We ended up going with some Ethiopian food, which was fine. But with nowhere to sit, ended up perching on a nearby kerb to eat it. I can only suggest getting there early might be the best way to make the most what the market has to offer (and there is plenty). Personally, much preferred the Sunday food market at Brick Lane.||August 1, 2015
reuvenhil||50||one of the greatest food markets i have ever been to. all kinds of different foods served. hundreds of people all the day eating and drinking all over. you`ll find there almost every kind of food u r looking. i have been there 3 times, each time i ate different food and i loved every byte.||August 1, 2015
SandraW13||50||After our visit to the Shard we decided to go over to Borough Market for some lunch, it is one of the most amazing food markets i have ever been to. They have everything here bread, cheese, chocolate, smoothies, pies pastries you name it they have it. You can walk around eating your food or if you prefer you can visit one of the several sit in restaurants it is well worth a visit.||July 31, 2015
AllanH328||50||I wish I had found this market before I had eaten lunch already. Stumbled upon it walking from the London Eye to Tower Bridge on a great path along the River Thames. Food vendors and other types of vendors are selling food and products in this cool setting. I did end up getting desert and loved it. I would definitely make sure I went back lunchtime next time I visit London. Great people watching too. ||July 31, 2015
Amelia B||50||Well worth a visit, so many choices, heaps of testers to try - you will not leave there disappointed or hungry!||July 31, 2015
Leesheeleeshee||50||This place is not to be missed while visiting London! Borough Market's selection just puts LA Grand Central Market (or any open market) to shame. It was crowded, it was vibrant, it was an amazing experience to be able to shop there. They had hard to find ingredients, wine, cheeses, bread, meats, mushrooms that I've only heard of but never really seen in real life, everything! They had Turkish Delight- which I've been wanting to try forever, prosciutto that they shaved off the bone- I've only seen them wrapped in plastic in a deli case, and glass cases of truffle! There was even a vendor that sold ONLY exotic meats! I knew I had to try their Kangaroo burger. DON'T MISS THIS PLACE, I would rather come here than see Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey etc, etc. if I had the opportunity to again.||July 31, 2015
Scunder||50||This is a must for any trip to London. I skipped the breakfast on the plane so I could land in London and go here and grab great food and it never disappoints. You could walk round this for hours and try (and buy if you're obliged) different things. Awesome||July 30, 2015
Paul B||50||This place is really busy with enthusiastic food lovers jostling for a huge range of foods. It's open between 11am and 4pm.All dishes that had were of the best quality ingredients beautifully cooked and just delicious. Finding a place to sit is a bit of a mission so many people just walked around eating. Recommended for a fun lunchtime experience.||July 29, 2015
Kenneth M||50||If you love food, this is a must visit while in London. Remeber the London Bridge Metro stop is the closest. It can be overwhelming with a crowd, so choose you visiting time wisely. Great way to start a picnic lunch. Get all your bread and food here and off you go to one of the many wonderful green spaces that London has. Many places to eat all around, but a picnic forces you to do even more. You might get your wine, or soda prior to getting food. Small amounts of many different treats is much better that alot of just one thing. Promise yourself that you will try some new and different foods. Be 5 or 7 years old again, and lets your parents bribe you into trying "Mashed Peas"kapm||July 29, 2015
WildTulip2013||50||We were in London for 3 days and came here every single day! They have a great selection of booths with all different kinds of Foods. Also, if you like chocolate, there is a Cafe called Cocoa Growers of St Lucia (or something like that) that has the best hot chocolate I have ever had (70% Chcocolate)!Also, the italian booth in the back has delicious fresh Pasta!Borough Market is easy to get to via tube (I think it´s London Bridge Station). Oh yeah, and London Bridge is right there, too :-)||July 29, 2015
Sami_b1||40||Visited here on Tuesday 28th July 2015, quite busy.....lovely smells. My daughter and I ate at cafe Brood, £9.95 for a single paella, we shared , more than enough for 2. Service not great perhaps wouldnt go back but the food was nice. Definately worth a visit just be careful of the prices, shop around.||July 29, 2015
Hodgiesmrs||50||We just visited the Borough Markets for the third time. Whenever we visit the UK I make sure we make time for the Borough Markets, so that should speak for itself! At the moment we live in a part of Asia where we can't get a whole lot of our favourite foods like good cheese, fancy oils and decent bread, so the Borough is heaven for us, though I am sure anyone who loves good food would love these markets. Everyone is super friendly. Taste everything you can. Go for the cheeses, the salami, the honey, the Turkish Delight. Hunt around till you find the guy selling the chocolate wine - it is surprisingly delicious. Test pomegranate oils and buy a mug with a painted Hairy Coo on it. Check out the gigantic cookies and try the venison. If you love fruit, it's here. If you love seafood, it's here. Fresh juices - yep. A quick snack or a full meal, you're sorted. In winter grab some mulled wine and in summer go for Pimms. Have lunch, enjoy the atmosphere, stay for a couple of hours then drag your goodies home for a lazy afternoon with the best nibblies ever! I love the Borough Markets and will find my way back again...||July 29, 2015
linneakleen||40||Big food market with lots of different food and a lot of people to look at. I wouldn't go here if I'm in a hurry because there are people everywhere. ||July 29, 2015
496carmenj||50||The atmosphere is so great! it is a busy market, but you can get great food from cookies, pies to burgers, to scottish egg, to currys. I love this market.The place of this market is so cool!! You can make some awesome pictures and the people are so friendly who work there. We had a great time spending 3 hours here. Cant wait to go back. It is not so hard to find, when you see a little cute church on a big road, follow the steps down and you walk right into the market. Make sure you are hungry and taste different kind of things. When you can, shop for fresh food.||July 29, 2015
Kristyn_FWilmette||50||Great place to visit if you love open markets! We went for lunch on a Monday this visit, and while it was significantly less crowded than a Saturday, not all the stalls were open. Everything is very fresh and you can find items not often found in America. Vendors are all super friendly and many samples are offered. A definite must if you enjoy open air markets!||July 29, 2015
Michaell333||50||Plan on spending a few hours here, and enjoy the sights, smells, and tastes of an amazing market. There are the best of the best food vendors, both ready to eat, and items to take home and enjoy. Cheeses, teas, all sorts of cuisines - it's a feast for every sense!||July 28, 2015
jdb339||50||Located near London Bridge tube Borough market is a foodie's paradise. Wide range of food stalls with great variety. Come here hungary as you can graze away eating at many stalls through the market. Bring a shopping bag for purchases that can be taken home for later||July 28, 2015
brunosartori||50||Great place, also a must go.Filled with local products. Great spot to eat and enjoy London's overall vibe,||July 28, 2015
Huasobruto||50||Let's just boil it down to this: the market was great fun and no visit to London should go without a stop. Such a wonderful place! Start with the duck confit sandwich on brioche (near the main entrance), then work your way through the cheese stalls, the bakers, the charcuterie stands, the vegetable purveyors, and every other bit of the place. Go hungry. Leave really really happy. Take your time. Enjoy. Soak in the fun, not to mention the fat from the ethereal duck confit sandwich. Wow. ||July 28, 2015
Akralaya||50||A beautiful place indescribable. A mix of colors, scents and flavors unique. From fruit and vegetables to exotic food. From spices to meat and cheeses.||July 27, 2015
fiddleleaffig||50||I love everything about this place, it is very clean(surprisingly), the people are very nice, everybody get in line, the food is AMAZING! I basically stayed in this place until my stomach couldn't eat anymore, and i still wish i could stay longer! I recommend you came here with empty stomach because you will want to eat everything!! ||July 27, 2015
mintmoocher||50||Loved the market hated the crowds it has become something of a must see place under the railway arches by London Bridge station. Recommend the pulled pork roll in Holts.||July 27, 2015
Chris K||50||An absolute Gem!!! Mouthwateringly good, make sure you have plenty of time to explore, and take a big bag!! Loads of stalls serving delicious eats whilst you wander around, quite literally anything you can think of. I will definitely be returning.....with a trolley!!||July 27, 2015
fruiteaberry||50||My favourite market cause of all the food! We went on a Saturday when the full market was open and we loved it so much we went back on a Sunday (without checking) and it was closed :(You must, must try the fish wrap (outside the main market area), scotched eggs, ice cream (outside the main market area), paella, duck confit sandwich and the pimps! Don't have breakfast before you go. Best to go in a group so that you can have as much food as possible!||July 26, 2015
Hluong||30||It's good when you come with just a half empty stomach haha. Many stalls but not actually many goood choice of food, quite similar. But still recommend you should come once when you visit London.||July 26, 2015
TerenceT||40||All sorts of food and produces can be found here, from coffee, beers, seafood to pies and cheese. It's great to grab a quick bite here if you are visiting the area.||July 26, 2015
Amy R||50||This market has been around for a thousand years, I guess. It is amazing to visit and to sample the large selection of foods available. There is a gluten-free bakery, and their treats were excellent. I have celiac disease so I get excited when there are GF bakeries. The raspberry with white chocolate brownie was yummy!I had lunch at an Indian booth and it was excellent. Many places offer gluten-free options and I found that the vendors, and London restaurants in general, are very good about ensuring that their selections are gluten free if they say they are.And for all others without eating issues, go for it!nit was a lot of fun!||July 26, 2015
cgroby||40||Great street market. We bought fixings for lunch. If you are in the area on the day(s) it is open, stop by.||July 26, 2015
arieger||40||This was a fun market to visit. Very busy in a Saturday afternoon- food everywhere! Ate at Fish! Cafe (salmon bacon- yummy)- then had some greedy goat ice cream- then off to the veggie stand (end of the day had great deals on fruit). ||July 26, 2015
danihope||50||Borough Market is a fantastic place to go for breakfast, lunch or any meal of the day really! We arrived in time for breakfast and struggled to choose where to eat, there are plenty of bakery stalls selling pastries, croissants, breads and cakes and the hot food vendors did their own version of breakfast. We were heading home before lunch so I bought a hot salt beef bagel to eat on the train journey home. It was delicious. If I lived near by I would go to try every vendor!||July 26, 2015
William C||50||My wife and I meandered through the stalls in the Market. One cannot even begin to fathom the wide variety of food available here. If nothing else, go to have breakfast or lunch and watch Londoners pass by. ||July 26, 2015
Inglewood P||40||On a sunny day, this is a great market area to explore. Great food, wonderful cheese, wine, meat and produce shops. Lots to see in a historical part of london. Take a walk along the Queens Way on the southbank of the Thames or cross the tower bridge and you will find the market on the south side just under the tower bridge. London Bridge tube stop is the closest station. On a sunny saturday this place is hopping! ||July 26, 2015
sandraf516||40||Visited when in London last weekend. I'm never disappointed by the vast display of food and crafts on sale. You can spend a good few hours just wandering around the stalls tasting loads of different foods. The stall holders are so happy to help and advise.||July 26, 2015
crazybubbas||50||We loved this place. Lots of prepared food (eg warm food to eat there and stuff you can take home to eat later) and artisinal food. Everyone was willing to answer all of our questions and seemed really excited about the food they were selling/making/producing.||July 26, 2015
Country-queen40||50||If your a foodie this is an amazing market. There is a wide range of food (and restaurants) to suit all tastes. It also a great place to hang out and take in the London Culture. We `loved it' so much we went twice on this visit. ||July 26, 2015
IFlank||40||There are many stalls offering similar products but all of them have a different twist. Some are organic, some are just locally grown but there is everything from spices to bread, fish to meat, food stalls with ready cooked meals and even an oyster stand if you want to enjoy them fresh or take them home to cook.There are also plenty of stalls and shops around the edges of the market that make it an enjoyable visit with plenty to see and taste.The nearest tube station is London bridge with signs in the station on which side to exit||July 25, 2015
Sandra R||50||My favorite market in London! Everyday while in London I come to the Borough Market for lunch. You can have a little of this and a little of that, however the portions are not little! Its very clean and lively with people playing music. There is not really any place to sit down and eat but if your lucky you can find an old whisky barrel to sit down on.||July 25, 2015
DaffyT55||50||I love the variety they have at Borough Market and I had a blast going to every store. We loved the food and the people are just lovely. It was a little too crowded for my liking but the good food made up for the jam and the wait.||July 25, 2015
925Molly||50||Been going to the market for some years now and never really know what I'm going to end up eating! Lots of variety and choice. Would recommend walking for a bit to choose what you want. Also some places do pretty small eats for like 3 pounds or so that you can get a few of (British tapas maybe!). Would also recommend the exotic meat stall - have had varying meat from there including kangaroo, ostrich, wild boar, springbok and others ||July 25, 2015
D12GWA||40||This place is great for all the different varieties of international foods. Try and avoid weekends because it's too busy. Highly recommend the pulled pork burger!!||July 24, 2015
Asizehcnas||50||I stumbled across this market by accident: It was 2 pm in the afternoon, and I wasn't planning on eating anything until dinner. Well, that changed as soon as I walked into this market, and that's a great thing!Borough Market is full of international foods. I ended up buying a Italian focaccia, a kangaroo burger from the Exotic Meat Company (kangaroo, really!), Turkish baklava, Spanish ladrón peppers, Italian Ubriaco cheese (cheese soaked in red wine), Mexican habanero peppers, Grenada Guava jelly, and Argentinian alfajores. Yet not only was the food wonderful but the prices were very reasonable and the vendors were very friendly, offering you samples as well as kindly discussing their particular product. If they didn't have what you were looking for (i.e. the Swiss and French cheese place didn't have the Swiss cheese Appenzeller that I was hoping to find), they would kindly recommend other places to you.I would highly recommend this place to anyone going to London. While it's very crowded depending on the day you go (I went on a Friday), the food and the different cultures represented were both outstanding and the people watching even better!||July 24, 2015
mingzy||40||My bro recommended we must go there 'cos he had been there on earlier date and had a glorious time feasting. We went on a Monday late morning. Unfortunately it was only a half market. (Website did say mon-wed half the shops are closed) but we only had that day free so we went anyway. Good selection of food stuffs from cheese to breads, fried food, from local cuisine to exotic African meals. Most are just stalls which you buy, takeaway and stand around to munch. The prices aren't really cheap. We had a scotch egg and salad for £6+ but it was real tasty.The famous Monmouth coffee was £2.50 a small cup of latte. Tasted a little bit more "fragrant" than normal Starbucks. Perhaps it's the fresh roasted coffee beans. The grilled scallops and oysters were really fresh. And we even tried authentic english jelly eels! A very good experience. Recommended for any foodie!! ||July 24, 2015

It has a real buzz about the place and it is great wandering around all the stalls trying out the food.There is a chocolate stall ( sorry can't remember the name) but we always buy some misshape chocolates to take home.Only £2.50 a bag!There is lots of different types of food here.For a late lunch we had a bratwurst with sauerkraut which was very tasty.||July 24, 2015
yobar41||50||Don't miss this market, it is probably the best one that is visited.the most important thing is to go hungry.most of the reatailers would give you a taste and an explanation about their food.Don't miss this amazing market||July 24, 2015
ChiliandTart2014||50||enjoyed strolling and checking out all the stalls and shops. so many small places to snack and grab a bite, but there is limited seating so make sure you are fine eating while wandering. full review with pictures of my time here chiliandtart.tumblr.com. hope you enjoy!||July 23, 2015
Isy z||40||A nice place to eat finger food from all over the world! lots of stands, smells and colors!! it's easy to reach, by bus, tube, walking...and near the Thames!||July 23, 2015
alegiuppo||40||Good street food in a good location definitely worth a lunch time visit. Its busy but we didnt have to wait long to get our food.||July 23, 2015
Julie E||50||Just returned from a visit to this brilliant place. Lots of 'artisan'type foods, bread, olives, sausages, meat, oysters, fish, vegetables etc. lots of places, reasonably priced, to eat or just have a coffee. Full of life and people!||July 23, 2015
180michael||50||Fantastic place to buy almost anything foodie - artisan bakers, butchers, fishmongers, wines, olive oils, and products from many countries. Also has lots of food stalls, and everything looks (and tastes) really good. One thing lacking is any seating on which to eat what you've bought, but that's a minor detail.||July 23, 2015
Ron S||50||Great place to visit if you love food or just want to sit back enjoy a coffee & watch the world go by. So much wonderful food from artisan breads, delicious cheeses, fresh meats, cured deli meats & pâtés. Vast selection if fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs. If only I'd had more time & space to buy more. Definitely worth a visit.||July 23, 2015
Rajesh1965||40||It is a haven for anybody who cares about the quality and provenance of the food they eat - chefs, restaurateurs, passionate amateur cooks and people who just happen to love eating and drinking.+ Just 2m from London Tower Bridge+ Ethnic Foods to try+ International Organic Food/Cheese+ Home made Chocolate & Fudge- Would love to see a bench to sit and relax,or just have a drink in the market square.||July 22, 2015
rojack4||40||Fascinating array of produce and cooked food, many available to sample, however gets extremely busy over lunch hours, so go early so you can enjoy wondering around.||July 22, 2015
Bigsteve62||50||I so wish I knew about this market before , the vibe is awesome , the food was unbelievable , we had some soul food from one of the many stalls around the area , I've travelled a lot but this " street food " takes some beating .||July 22, 2015
justinw635||40||My wife and I fancied taking in a bit of the London market scene and Borough was enroute to our shopping destination. This place was just what we needed, the hustle and bustle from the stall owners and the many smells of the great food on offer. The choice and variety was fantastic and we ate our fare as we wandered around for a while before heading on our way. A good way to spend a hour or two!||July 22, 2015
Diveguide||50||Ive read about this place and seen it on TV, but after visiting it its on my must do list for every london tripIt opens late on weekdays, don't know about weekends, we went at 10am and most stalls were setting up, there are some samples of products but this isn't a place you can graze on samples, I need a cool box for everything that I want to buy, hand made pies, cheeses form all over the world, pastries, artisan bread (as an ex baker I'm a bit critical of what people call artisan bread theres both good and bad here)Cooked and cured meatsIf you go early get a coffee from the monmouth coffee company and some danish pasties from one of the stalls, find a seat end watch the world go byLots of food stalls selling food from every continent Go Hungry is my best advice||July 22, 2015
446leichhardt||40||Saturday morning, where else would you be but exploring the wonderfull produce markets, it is all avalable here in abundance. From the wonderfull black truffles to the mountains of crusty fresh bread, the aromas assault the senses. The huge cheese wheels and all other wonderfull fish and meat produce are temptations. Enjoy!||July 22, 2015
Beeecky_L||50||The one food to try out at the borough market has to be Raclette! For those of you who has yet to try this wonderful snack from heaven... It's a dish where cheese that's being grilled and sliced off onto boiled potatoes and served with mini gherkins! It is simply food that makes you feel so happy! When you are in Borough market you can smell the wonderful cheese from afar! Apart from Raclette, do also try out the artisan bakery brownies too! Yummy and chewy, rich in chocolate taste but it's not very sweet. Burgers are also a must try! You would not regret it! If you want to get cheese, they have so many stores that sells cheese from all over the world! So if you want to visit Borough market make sure you go there on an empty tummy!||July 22, 2015
342SteveO||50||Borough market, next to London Bridge Station is a real Aladdin's cave for foodies.It sells everything from a wide range of prepared street foods to ingredients from the micro level (spices, flours, teas) to macro level (breads, cheeses, charcuterie, cakes etc.). If you can't find it here, it probably doesn't exist!Street food on offer ranged from falafels, mezze, pies, toasted cheese to scotch eggs and IndianThere are also a number of static cafes including the excellent tapas bar run by Brindisa on the corner of Southwark Street.||July 22, 2015
Peter B||40||Did not know this was on Trip advisor but it's made me leave a comment. If your in London do it ! I love this place it's just a half hour train journey for me from the sticks to London Bridge on fast train and just as quick to return home laden with good cheese,Gin or Whiskey proper bread and real butter and a fancy cake to finish. Travelers please note Thursday Friday Saturday only,some traders are there on other days but not the same as the full on market||July 22, 2015
yumtum1971||50||On arrival there were a lot of people bustling everywhere to find the thing that interests the most, once in the swing of things, there was all manner of delights, from Spice to Oysters. The street food is phenomenal and worth a visit just for that.There are a hundred different types of cuisines to try and taste their beautiful produce.Go, you will not regret it.||July 22, 2015
Mongo1234||50||I made two trips to the Borough Market during my recent visit to London. I went on a Tuesday and about half the stands were closed. Go later in the week when all the stands are open. There is a wide variety of treats for all foodies. You can get fresh seafood, cheese from all over Europe, meats, flowers, fruits and vegetables. There are several stands selling food as well as sit down restaurants and bars. When in London, take a half a day trip through the Borough Market. You will love it.||July 21, 2015
AtlantaMike_13||50||Great way to get a local feel for London. Join the locals for lunch and/or shopping at downtown farmers market and food stalls. Great assortment of different types of food and beverages. Also has some souvenirs. Visit several times during trip to London, every day has different assortment of food and folks. ||July 21, 2015
kikiwhite69||50||We literally ate our way through this market. The absolute best vanilla cream donut I have every eaten. Bring your appetite and cash and be prepared to enjoy a sensory treat.Ignore TFL and take the London Bridge tube stop. It's just across the street.||July 21, 2015
Daniel C||50||I like to eat! It's as simple as that. This market is full of all kinds of different cuisines and also a selection of fresh produce. It is a short walk from London bridge underground station. It's loud, vibrant and busy like any good marketplace should be.We tried the venison burger, truffle and goat cheese ravioli, fresh juices and oysters, which were all delicious. Make sure to starve yourself beforehand because there were many other things we wanted to try but were too full. Be prepared to eat whilst walking or standing around because there's not much in terms of seating areas.||July 21, 2015
HongKongCallisto||40||So many lovely stalls and specialist gourmet stands! I wish I had not eaten before I went in! I only had hand luggage back to HK so could not binge shop on all the fabulous goods! Could do with some more cooking and craft shops I think - but the variety of the food stands makes up for anything!||July 20, 2015
Well_travelled_Jock||50||This is a real assault on the senses, if you like your food and drink this is the place to go. Totally international flavour to the place, tastes from around the world. The title refers to the fact that you could probably make a meal out of all the free samples on offer.||July 20, 2015
Sue S||40||We have visited this market before, in February, so knew what to expect but just love the atmosphere and the food stalls are great for lunch on the go, lots of foody stalls and delicious products and lots of cheeses. July on a Saturday in sunshine, well it was packed, couldnt move so probably go next time during the week or out season.||July 20, 2015
Tippex1818||50||Borough Market never fails to lift my spirits and last week was no exception. It is a mix of food stalls, craft fair and marketstalls. There is so much to see that it can be a little overwhelming initially. Each time I go I always try to navigate my way around in an orderly fashion so as not to miss anything but each time I fail as I get drawn away by something that catches my eye!Most of the stalls allow you try their wares before you buy and the vendors are very knowledgeable about their wares. It's such a shame that I can never buy all that I want as I live so far away and my trips to London normally coincide with a journey elsewhere after my visit to the market. I thoroughly recommend anyone to visit Borough market to experience the sights, the smells and sample the delicious food!||July 20, 2015
TeoKand||40||This market is like a small outdoors camden where you can enjoy your self for a few hours. It is packed with young people looking for a place to sit and drink, especially in early afternoon. Like camden, you can find anything and everythingto eat and drink, from burgers, burritos, to cocktails, pims, sangria etc||July 19, 2015
LDemands||50||The sheer number of selection to choose from is so varied that it can take you a whole month if you want to sample cooking all the selections available. But that is also the downside. As tourist, it is hard to cook or take home a lot of the items you see. But it is something food lovers shouldnot miss||July 18, 2015
Owenthomas||50||We always go to Boroughs market, it is fun to see all the various food, all the vendors are really friendly, and you can eat some really tasty food. We love the We love the kappacasein cheese sandwich – a walk-up eatery. Located within the Borough Market, just outside of the London Bridge station. We have to have their cheese sandwich every time we are in London (at least once). They seem to always have a line, but it moves quickly. Many stalls of cheese and breads, but lots of other things too. Great gifts and souvenirs can be found here also. We had some great iced coffee from one small stand. Only open Thursday through Saturday. When you leave the London Bridge Station, watch for signs for the market or Southwark Cathedral, which is next to it.||July 18, 2015
R_Gabriel2013||50||I lived in England for three months and somehow never heard of this place until a friend told me about it on a recent trip. This is the BEST way to spend a free morning in town. A quick walk from the London Bridge stop, tons of regional and local vendors selling all kinds of handmade, organic products. It's part farmer's market, part craft fair, part food court. If you catch a stand without a big line you can really talk to the vendors about their products and how they're made. Most of them are intimately involved in production and/or know the history of what they're selling really well, so it's like a museum you can chat and eat your way through. There are a few great places for food, and a couple of wine stores that sell cocktails to go so you can wander the market with your prosecco and enjoy. When you've seen it all, you're close to the river, within walking distance of several tube stops and well on your way to places like London Bridge and Vinopolis.||July 18, 2015
BWSiegenthaler||50||Dashed through Borough Market and loved the sights and sounds. Only wished we could have sampled the many delicacies offered. Will definitely go back on our next trip.||July 18, 2015
wkdpink44||40||Walked through Borough market on my way to the nearby Clink Museum on a Friday morning. The smells and sights of food stalls making fresh dishes from around the globe were amazing, even at 11 in the morning! It was surprisingly busy, loads of tourists and local business people. Much nicer than the usual chaotic markets at Camden and Portobello! Recommended.||July 18, 2015
Djbar425||40||We loved walking through the market and grabbing random fresh items for breakfast. The food is fresh and is so good. The vendors are friendly and the market is clean. ||July 18, 2015
446damianv||40||Had a couple of hours to kill before going up the shard so popped in for a look. Even though I had only just had lunch the smell of food was mouth-watering. A huge selection of take away food and artisan foods to take home. Obviously its London tourist prices but as long as you are sensible it's not to expensive. Very enjoyable !||July 18, 2015
67gibby||50||Came across by accident enroute to the shard. Foods and smells of the world all under one roof! Just had a quick walk through ,but defo return next time in London.||July 17, 2015
755christlv||40||My daughter and myself liked the Market with all the different stalls and fresh produce very much. Very photogenic and we felt sorry, being a Tourist and could not shop for home cooking! But we bought fruits which where in season. The best of all we had lunch at one of the Restaurants on the 1st floor called 'Roast'. Highly recommendable, pricy, but best Roast ever!||July 17, 2015
suzannelW8508EX||40||So many yummy things to choose from. It is very crowded though. It is easy to get to as there is a tube station there. I don't know when it closes, but seemed like there was always activity there.||July 17, 2015
AMr0ue||50||Excellent experience, we kept walking and trying one item from different food carts, the fresh oysters were the best!!||July 17, 2015
Secondari_NYC||50||I love Burough Market! What a wonderful place to go. This is essentially a farmer's market on the south side of the Thames near the Tower bridge. The market has been made permanent and in additional to your usual farmers market fare there are food stalls, and crafts. I recommend going to the market for breakfast of lunch with a good appetite. Groups can find something to suit ever taste. Middle easter, Italian, India, and traditional English food, and BBQ! Travelers can pick up a bit of cheese, fruit, and break and make a nice picnic in the church yard next door. Burough Market is lovely, there are public rest room, it has everything a weary traveler needs!||July 17, 2015
EatDrinkTravel2009||50||This market is simply fantastic! You will find an enormous selection of artisan cheeses, baked goods, sausages, cheese, wine..... pretty much anything you can think of. I could easily spend an entire day just walking through the market just munching on small bites. I would highly recommend a day trip to the market if you have the time. ||July 17, 2015
Wetwedgie||50||Often visit the market on a thursday or friday during lunchtime. Lots of great food on offer and the place has an awesome vibe about it. I tend to take along my vintage polaroid camera to snap afew shot of the colours.||July 17, 2015
Greta I||50||Go on Saturday for lunch! Lots of free bite samples, and a variety of lunch food to chose from. There's also a very delicious fish and chips place, but you can very easily opt for something lighter too, and you won't be disappointed! Guaranteed!||July 17, 2015
CateSums||50||I only wish we had a market like this near me! London's Borough Market is right outside the tube station so it's extremely easy to get to, there are plenty of market stalls to keep you occupied - cheese, bread, Italian, spices etc. Most of them were offering tasters as well and one thing I did notice was that they didn't pester you to come and look/buy things, so it made actually looking at the stalls a lot more relaxed. It was really busy, but this was at 10am on a Saturday.If I didn't have to wait 8 hours until i was home, I definitely would've bought more.Highly recommended! ||July 17, 2015
Mia S||50||A food market that has been running since the 13th century, it really says it all doesn’t it? Tucked away under a Rail viaduct Borough Market, once you find it, is crammed with gourmet goodies – and the best thing is you have plenty of opportunities to sample or buy something to take away and weave your way through the stalls taking in all the fantastic foods on offer. Borough Market has a great vibe, it is a surprisingly fun way to spend a morning.||July 17, 2015
Walton2||50||We really loved our visits to Borough Market. The place just bustles with people and offers food from every corner of the Earth. We liked the tasters on offer at most of the stalls and the friendliness of the market traders.It is a good thing we don't live too close because I'm pretty sure we would never leave the place.Just Great, well worth a visit !||July 16, 2015
RobMcAndrews||50||This place is among my fave things to do when in London. As I draw near, I get the faint smell of the stalls & the produce & I just lose self controlIn this beautiful market setting there is nothing you cannot get. Some things are over-priced, some just amazing, but everything is a marvel& the stall holders are a joy. Just so friendly & welcomingI just wished I could live locally so I could use the market on a daily basis||July 16, 2015
magictigger||50||The range of food there is off the chart. Just superb. From all around the world. Lovely safe environment and everyone is relaxed. Right by London Bridge. Loads of fun with music sometimes and so on. There is a restaurant nearby (sorry cannot remember the name so you will have to google) at which you can have them cook what you have bought for £10 per head cost. Brilliant. Probably the best market in the UK. Very famous and rightly so.||July 16, 2015
ElizabethAdam||50||Lots of variety of food,good selection to buy., need someone to carry it all home!!Richard Bramble ceramics amazing, not cheap but of very good quality .||July 16, 2015
373brianf||50||What a great way to explore some of the great culinary and entertainment treats of London. A true natural market with something for everyone. Graze from booth to booth to try some of the most delicious wares in the world. Nothing better on a nice summer day.||July 16, 2015
leahahx||40||Although small there was an array of different things to try! Go hungry and buy lots of little bits! The duck wrap was out of this world. The fresh pasta was amazing. The chocolate brownie was good. The coffee was great. The pad Thai looked amazing. There's so much to try make sure you walk around everything first and then decide. Well worth a trip!||July 16, 2015
LondonWinnie||50||One of London's greats. Taste and drink the flavours from around the country. Bring a shopping trolley. The meats, cheeses. fish and pate are devine. Sample them, buy them, take them home.Once done here go for a nice champagne lunch and a walk along the Southbank||July 16, 2015
Vanessa B||50||fabulous outdoor market, has all sorts of exotic foods as well as the basics, you could buy bread,cheese, honey or buy something to eat as your walking around, there's something for everyone. ||July 16, 2015
Melissa M||50||So great to chill with friends and get some lunch / an amazing brownie. Make sure you come with an empty stomach!||July 16, 2015
maxm2272015||50||Great food and a wide selection. A lot of the vendors have small samples you can try before you buy something so you can make the right decision of what you get. Make sure you go Thursday-Sunday though for the best selection.||July 16, 2015
87hjm||50||Been here so many times and it never fails to disappoint. If you've got a lazy day you can walk round trying tasters, have a seat and people watch or have a snack or meal at one of the many stalls or vendors. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars around too if you want something a bit more substantial. If buying food to cook at home the fresh produce is excellent and the traders know their produce inside out so can help with any query or recommendation request. Definitely worth a visit but it can get very busy.||July 16, 2015
Emily C||50||We were lucky enough to be staying near Borough Market. It is fantastic for little treats or larger treats :) If you go you must try the brownies!!! DELICIOUS||July 15, 2015
RTrivia||50||It's a great food market. Lots to eat. Affordable Go hungry for sure. Bring cash also. We enjoyed the raclette vendor !! Enjoy||July 15, 2015
gourmeted||50||What a feast for the senses, this market. Love trying all the food it has to offer. It made me wish for an extra stomach or two. We bought baked treats and sweets to eat while we roam around the city and also for late night snacks at the hotel. One visit is not enough.||July 15, 2015
KathrineTus||50||I absolutely love food markets, but this one takes the cake :-P Unfortunately I didn't have a lot of time here, but that's just my excuse for returning soon! We were three friends eating three different places and we all loved it what we got. If i get to stay a place with kitchen the next time I'm in London I will buy my ingredients here. What a great place.||July 15, 2015
ridler36man||50||I always try and pop in when I'm working in the area as the food in the market is first class. I can recommend Scotchtails scotch eggs with sweet potato fries, and the salt beef sandwich stall i visited yesterday. I had a proper sandwich with lots of pickles, shredded onion and cabbage, mustard all served on thick rye bread. Oh and the salt beef was melt in the mouth! ||July 15, 2015
Mumseword||40||We went on a Wednesday. Not every stall was opened, but enough to whet your appetite for more! We tried very delicious pasta from La Tua Pasta, and very good brownies from one of the desserts stalls. We tried a bit of everything, and they were all good, just that the pasta was very very good! As our kids were with us, we bought our food and made our way to Southwark Cathedral's gardens and sat by the benches to have our lunch. Mum had the very famous coffee from Monmouth Cafe, and she says it's heavenly!! And of course we bought back BAGS of GRANOLA from award winning Mini Magoos. Bought back to give away as gifts. They were very fresh, very unique and really tasty! The prices weren't that great, but for the experience and the food, I would say do go. It's worth it.||July 15, 2015
Rekon||40||I am glad I decided to stop at this place. There all of types of vendors selling food from different cultures. It is busy with people eating their food standing up at the corners throughout the market. Most of the vendors do not have a place where you can sit and enjoy your food. I stop at a vendor and ordered a shrimp wrap on steroids: it had jumbo shrimp, some kind of red, white sauce and lettuce. The next day I went for seconds; this time I ask to add more shrimp for an extra pound. Other vendors were selling what it look like a hamburger with a bratwurst as the main ingredient. Other vendors were selling jellies, ham, fish, paella, etc. It also a good opportunity to take pictures. You do want to have a story to tell when you get back home. Next time in London this place is must, I might even give Paella a try.||July 14, 2015
555simonh||50||Having been here a few times before this visit again didn't disappoint and I had to leave a review! From just walking around the corner the smell of food, the atmosphere of the market and luckily for my girlfriend and myself the weather. Clean toilets, great food, get warm scotch egg with sweet potato fries and your visit will be complete! Cannot wait for my next visit! ||July 14, 2015
89gemmah||50||Every time I visit London I also visit Borough Market. £10 bottle of prosecco and delicious food everywhere you look! Not to be missed! Take the tube to London Bridge and Borough Market is just across the road.Surrounded by quirky bars that are worth a visit, especially underneath the umbrellas at vinopolis! Gets very busy on a Saturday but well worth a visit! Open wed -sat.Well worth a visit. Stalls for all occasionsItalian meatsBreadsOlives CheeseFishPoultryOlive oilTrufflesCraft stallsCakeCookiesChutneysEtc etc...As well as stall after stall of food ready to eat as you walk around (I highly recommend the scotch tails...gorgeous hot Scotch eggs and sweet potato fries...and the salt beef sandwiches are just amazing too!!)Where else can you walk round with prosecco on hand in such a relaxed way!||July 14, 2015
gracel17||50||...nestled in the heart of London is a haven for food lovers... where the savory aroma from the mounds of paella and melting cheese linger and beg for a 2nd look... the bright colors from the produce and the Turkish delights give eating with your eyes a new meaning.... and the samples of the Spanish Jamon have you begging for 'some more please'.... this place will have you in a trance so deep that you'll block out the crowds and willingly wait in... it's a short walk from the London Bridge tube stop and a MUST DO if you're in London||July 14, 2015
merlin03||50||Great place to visit just off London Bridge. Always lots going on especially at lunch time where there is a great selection of dishes from all around the world. There are also loads of unique stalls selling breads, cheeses, meats and fish etc. I like the Dorset scallops. This is London's answer to Pikes Place market in Seattle. Well worth a visit.||July 14, 2015
Ron T||50||This was our first visit to this world famous market. One of the best food experiences of my life. Everything for everybody. A goodies heaven||July 14, 2015
bigonion||50||One of the finest food markets I have seen in a very long time. The wonderful aromas that fill the air. The freshly cooked/prepared foods to sample and purchase. And, many unique jarred & packaged products to take away. We had oysters and beer. Meats & cheeses. Very nice still cider. Really could have spent an entire afternoon here.The highlights for me were Neal's Yard Dairy for amazing cheeses, and the Whisky Exchange. Thankfully I had eaten quite a bit before entering the Whisky Exchange.....we had a nice discussion about what I enjoy as a flavor palate. Numerous samples of 50-100 pound bottles before purchasing one. Was quite impressed with that - hard to spend $100+ on a bottle of liquor without sampling. And, they wrapped it to carry home in my suitcase.||July 13, 2015
Anlaws||50||A food market incorporating foods from all around the world. A good place to grab a quick lunch or to buy an obscure ingredient for an ethnic dish! ||July 13, 2015
EmmaPeak||50||Simply cannot fault this market. It's one of the best food markets I've visited, fresh fruit and veg stalls at such great prices selling organic products! Amazing cheese and bread stalls, spoilt for choice with things to have for lunch! Plenty of bakery and sweet stalls. Brilliant on a sunny day with views of the shard! ||July 13, 2015
MuffinManMatty||50||So love Borough market - it's somewhere to people watch / find fine foods / oils / breads, and lunch. You really need to explore, and check every stall out as there is something for everyone. ||July 13, 2015
Sabyasachi80||50||Truly food lovers' paradise. A true melange of cuisines from all over the world. You will find anything and everything that can be called food, starting from exotic meats to varieties of cheese, mushrooms, spices from the corners of Africa and evething in between. Must visit place for a foody.||July 12, 2015
Lauren4491||50||This market is full of different types of food and they all smell amazing. The fresh juices and bakery foods are amazing! There is one stall that has "the best doughnuts in the world" and they seriously are the best!||July 12, 2015
happysong123||50||Borough Market is great to visit and hang out in if you are an adventurous foodie. Big place with many stalls carrying a wide variety of food types. Breads, cakes, meats, salads, desserts, sandwiches, drinks .. you'll find them all and more. From the main area, we crossed over to another building that had even more and bigger stalls, so move around so you don't miss anything. Our favorite was a small stall that served a mound of melted cheese on top of boiled potatoes. Worth standing in the long line.||July 12, 2015
LPTST||50||Just love Borough Market, first on our list when visiting London. Love the history, the food, the stalls.||July 12, 2015
manwey01||50||Fantastic place to wander and sample simple but amazing street food. We tried the chicken wraps: fresh moist roasted chicken breast, Mayo, lettuce and special sauce..... Simply Amazing. Later washed down with a Strawberry and Raspberry drink. Must try!||July 12, 2015
SallyF906||50||This is an interesting market in a lovely setting. All sorts of food stalls from all over the world - food freshly prepared to eat, food to take away, fresh vegetables, meat, bakeries, wine and so much more. A very vibrant atmosphere. Even if you don't want to buy anything, it's worth a visit just to wander through and look at everything although you are bound to come away with something!||July 12, 2015
N9484RGmaryb||50||This is a great place to go to experience a taste, or several, of London. There are so many stalls with an abundance of fresh food. You may smell something intoxicating as you arrive but I would suggest you resist the urge, walk around and see what is there before you buy. You may discover something you like even better! There are some vendors who only sell food and there are some who sell packaged products such as spices, jams, relishes, coffee, tea and fresh pasta, The vendors are very welcoming and encourage you to try their products. There are a variety of cuisines and something for everyone. We had walked across Tower Bridge, visited Borough Market and then walked along the South Bank and made a day of it. I would suggest visiting at the weekend as there are fewer stalls through the week. We went back on a Tuesday as we were passing the area and there were far fewer stalls but enough to make us stop for a snack. Oh, and save room for dessert! The fudge, pastries and sweets are divine. ||July 12, 2015
Cenza B||50||Having been to London before, I couldn't imagine that there was much more to see or experience but I was wrong. A friend introduced us to the Borough Market and what an unexpected treasure it turned out to be: colourful, interesting, visually and appetisingly appealing. We found fresh produce from both local surrounds and Europe and needless to say we left with a bag full (or two) of the best cheeses, sausages, breads and fruit that very tastefully enhanced our next few meals. You can also find a great variety of local and not so local beers and wines. We just loved the bright and lively atmosphere of this market. A must see for any tourist and local alike.||July 11, 2015
Nicole E||50||A wonderful treat for anyone who likes to experience fresh, unique, tasty goods! From the fresh fruits and veggies, to the yummy pastries, to the fish and meats, this place has it all. Get there early in the morning to allow for crowd free browsing and visiting with all the local vendors. A must see in London on Saturday morning!||July 11, 2015
Livia H||30||This is a good place to look around, but you would need to be very flush to actually buy anything. If you are passing, make sure you look at the Chez Michele flower shop. It was the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron in the Prisoner of Azkaban.||July 11, 2015
Sue G||50||Always make a point of coming to the market when we come to London. The range of produce is amazing and have never met a stall holder who wasent helpful and very knowledgable about their products. You can tell by the enthusastic conversations you have with the stall holders they love what they do. This place is a must for anyone and we have told lots of our friends to visit and they have also been impressed by the market.||July 11, 2015
Adriana C||50||Visit Borough Market with an empty stomach!! Definitely worth the visit, I always try to taste from a variety of different stalls. They have everything from Italian to Indian to German to Turkish, etc.||July 11, 2015
Cristina M||40||Don't you ever date to go to London and don't walk around this market, especially at lunch time when people from all over the offices are eating; the food is amazing but the cultural experience is even better, there's a little place where the make fresh pasta that was a highlight, also the sangria is delicious if ever a bit overpriced ||July 11, 2015
annettet||40||We had a wonder for a couple of hours arriving just after it opened it was nice and quiet so you could easily get around and see everything. We made the mistake of saying we would return & buy what we wanted before we went home on our return mid afternoon it was absolutely heaving and some of the items we wanted had sold out so buy when you see it so you don't miss out.So many different and interesting things to arouse your senses not cheap but great for a treat, go and enjoy||July 11, 2015
Kate P||40||great fun to browse, but even better to stop and buy a great range of fruit, vegetables, dairy produce and cooked food. Lots of tastings available.||July 10, 2015
Little-Rambler||50||Busy food market with loads of stalls selling food from all over the world. Some good restaurants and bars nearby make it a perfect lunchtime destination. Really lively atmosphere - Don't miss it!||July 10, 2015
RickyR900||50||A must while in London. Stop off and get some great food and a proper flat white. Great atmosphere and wonderful vendors around every corner. ||July 10, 2015
triptik123||50||I loved this place. The cheese toastie is the best, but split it with a friend bc it is rich! I also tried the melted cheese over diced potatoes with pickles on the side and it was okay. The dolmas are great, as is the rose Turkish delight. Just try anything you can. It all looks good. Oh and the raspberries are actually sweet and inexpensive....I took them back to our apartment and had them as a snack.Monmouth's flat white is very good. On another note, there are bathrooms there. From what I remember, it is a one at a time kind of bathroom. It was clean....good enough and free.||July 10, 2015
TasteLord007||50||Dont go on saturday when its heaving with people, but on a thursday or friday you are in for a treat, juices, pasta salad meat whatever your into its here and the atmosphere is buzzing with like minded food centred people.Go||July 10, 2015
Demy_70_S||50||This food market was a surprise to us. A lot of stalls with plenty of different dishes from almost every continent. From the fish and chips to the german sausages to Egyptian dishes, you can fill your stomach with plenty of good food. Try it out, busy at lunch time but it's worth the waiting time....||July 9, 2015
Hoffman4||40||This was easier to find than I thought it would be, just follow the signs, lots of good food to eat, it was a Monday so I think not everything was open.||July 9, 2015
arbin||50||While having a few pints at Blue Boar, met this guy who gave us some advise as what to see while in London. We took his advise and went to the Borough Market (and Greenwich too). The market had so much going on, all your senses on overload. All the types of food, spices, cooking going on was awesome. We went there hungry, and with so many choices was hard to decide what to get. (thanks for the tips, you were right on)||July 9, 2015
Alyce0707||50||Don't eat before you go, there is so much delicious food to try. We also took plenty of reusable bags so that we could fill them with treats for a picnic lunch later. Top picks: a Pimms while you wander around, the vegetarian burgers, fresh nectarines from the fruit stall, London honey and some dark rye bread with cumin seeds. ||July 9, 2015
andy s||40||Typical Londoner warmth and friendly service. Curry from one of the many hot food stalls was brilliant. Oysters from the fish stall were excellent and cost £1.50 each. Glass of Prosecco from the nearest wine shack was six pounds. Lots of variety to choose from for drinks and food. Cheese stall was also excellent. Well worth a visit if you are near London Bridge and have an hour to spare for lunch. Nice little pub tucked away behind the car park.||July 9, 2015
wrej||50||Borough Market is just fabulous any time of the year. I know tourists love it but I am a Londoner and I love it too. It is really only open Thur/Fri/Sat. If I want to do shopping I get there really early and have some sort of delicious bacon and egg concoction (making my mouth water thinking about it) for breakfast. For a really special treat for breakfast go to Roast. A birthday brunch would be great. In the winter there is the wonderful smells of the mulled wine but the hot spiced apple juice is really delicious. The surrounding shops and restaurants are great too. The area is really interesting as you have Nancy's steps from Oliver. The Golden Hind, The Clink Prison and walking further along the river The Globe Theatre and lots of things in between.||July 9, 2015
Dave L||50||Essentially this is a food market and a foodies playground, with stall selling specialty cheeses and breads, ham's, organic meats, fish and veg plus a myriad of other beautifully presented food and cooked food. I know that once visited you will love it and probably come away with a selection of smelly cheeses and organic loaves which you will consume once you get home, however be aware that people will give you a strange look on the train as the cheese can start to smell rather whilst in a packed and warm carriage||July 9, 2015
AemiliusMaximus||50||You'll find around 50 food stalls and some small restaurants in this area. It's a good hang out during a tiresome city trip.||July 8, 2015
KayliVee||50||The market is huge, be sure not to miss any of it. A great morning out with food and drink options for anyone, with any tastes. ||July 8, 2015
Heather F||50||We wandered into the market while waiting for the evening rush for the Tube to thin out. Found several items that I was very pleased to discover. Quite an experience.||July 8, 2015
911Wendy||50||This is a bold market that will have foodies salivating at the lips. From giant ham rolls and fine coffee, to falafel schwarmas and rare meats - this is a great place for a morning stroll||July 8, 2015
scampic||50||Here in the market I tried very good crab and oysters which is so unforgettable. There are many type of food like paella, bagel, curry, cheese, cakes, jams, juices... and you will be so lost in this food paradise. Though it was so crowded but it's definitely very worth visiting.||July 8, 2015
Kristin C||50||My favorite part of London every time I visit.So much good food, both to enjoy there, and to take away to cook with later. Artisan cheeses, gluten-free options, exotic meals, fresh seafood. Also lots of small bars and restaurants surrounding the market. It's always easy to wander and experience new foods and treats.||July 8, 2015
Davide C||40||For me, this is one of the best Market in London! It's very crowded on saturday and it's closed on monday.Here you Can find many kind of food from different countries.||July 8, 2015
Joe B||40||I think I must have visited on an off day. It was mid week and most of the stalls were closed. The only ones open were mainly oil, cheese and cured meat places which were selling everything with a "truffle" base. That said, the food courts to the rear were awesome and had a massive variety of simple dishes which were not badly prices for London and tasted amazing. I had my first salted beef bagel which tasted amazing and was well worth the 6 pound||July 8, 2015
424saraj||40||A great district for good food and wine. Loads to choose from and open until late most evenings. Comes alive more at end of week and on weekends, when the market stall are open. But the surrounding restaurants and cafes are fabulous. My friends and I enjoyed a very good meal at Elliot's, norther Italian tapas style. Attentive and friendly staff nice wine (3 bottles went down a treat!!) not overly cheap, but Worth the dosh. Will return,||July 8, 2015
Kashmirite||40||This is a must - see market.Spend hours wandering through all all the stored and exploring all the food options.Lots of opportunities to explore and taste goodies.Fun times with friends ☺||July 8, 2015
Pinkclare2013||40||A great selection of street food and stalls selling artisan breads, cheeses etc. Worth a visit for a take away lunch.||July 8, 2015
Storyteller374840||50||Stumbled upon this market walking to London Bridge. This is a food market. Perfect for lunch. The wife and I got a few different things to try and absolutely loved it so much that we came back the next day to try things we couldn't fit in the first day. Definitely go and eat. My recommendation is EVERYTHING!||July 8, 2015
Justine H||40||An excellent variety of goods, fresh fruti and vege, breads, cheeses, salamis etc and cooked food stalls. Not really bargain 'market' prices but very yummy produce. Things to look out for - it closes early (by 5pm everything pretty much shut up) and there is no seating area to eat. ||July 8, 2015
OJG2013||50||Take a large shopping bag, and lose yourself in the narrow lanes of this wonderful food market. The stall are very nicely and originally presented, food looks delicious, make sure you eat here as well. There is a special feel to the hustle and bustle of a busy food market, and this one certainly does not disappoint!||July 8, 2015
anonymousI6761NF||50||Just go. Amazing food. Lots of variety, and mostly organic (I think). Really cool place even if you just walk through.||July 7, 2015
lostintransportation||30||There's no doubt that there is an endless array of stalls selling almost every imaginable food-to-go. But the prices are aimed at the unaware tourist - expensive almost cynically so. ||July 7, 2015
TheGirlsNY||50||I spent a morning at the market while my son and his girlfriend were on a tour. I walked around the whole (expansive) place and then went back to a few stalls to try some of the wonderful food. I ended up with an Italian sandwich, which you can get hot or cold (I opted for hot), and a Berliner doughnut. I also bought a lovely selection of spices at the Spice Mountain stall. My son loves curry and at this stall, I was able to get a few different kinds of curry powder for him to cook with. The market is foodie heaven! I can't wait to go back next time I'm in London.||July 7, 2015
NinatronPanda||50||We went to Borough Market for the first time last weekend after recommendations from friends and family and absolutely loved it. There's so much food to choose from it was hard to pick where to eat. I think we'll be going again next time we're up in London!||July 7, 2015
C A||50||I loved this place! It gets a bit crowded but still worth it. We walked from London Bridge underground station, a very nice walk with photo-friendly views :-)The market was truly amazing, so many booths with great produce and foods, lots of organic fruits, vegetables etc. We enjoyed some Egyptian Koshari, iced tea, green smoothies and cookies. Be sure to go there on an empty stomach!||July 7, 2015
Barry Y||50||What an amazing place, a hive of activity. A wide variety of produce available and a good vibe walking around.||July 7, 2015
Dannonday||40||A foodies paradise! So much food from all over the world and some of the smells knocked me over!!Some of the stalls were a little pricey but apart from that we'll worth a visit||July 7, 2015
Anne P||50||Loved the variety of foods and beverages that were available. Reasonably priced. Close to public transport. ||July 6, 2015
OrgasmicCry||50||Ok it gets very busy, so try to go early. So many nice bibles here I had to go to the cash point twice - take lots of money!Personal highlights were fresh Poole harbour oysters opened right in front of you for £1.50 each, kangaroo burger for £4.50, salted caramel and honeycomb doughnuts not cheap at £2.50 but still worth it, sangria & pimms to slide it all down with. And the spice market and truffle oil to take home.But just go, and create your own taste adventure. If you don't find something you like here you're The Walking Dead.||July 6, 2015
Anenet||50||we really enjoyed walking between all the boothes, sampling food and buying food. we had great time walking around - and also some wonderful food, including a great macaroon cookie, wonderful wild boar sausage, great italian cheese, great vegan cake and indian food, and wonderful meat pies. everything was very enjoyable. ||July 6, 2015
Ali A||50||Go there on an empty stomach and ejoy what all the booths have to offer! So much cheese, food, nuts, bread, meats, coffee and the goat milk ice-cream. I visit the market religiously when ever I am London and I suggest you do too!||July 6, 2015
Bob B||30||Ample food choice to eat throughout the whole day. Got the usual stuff you can get anywhere as well as unusual food stuff that's great to try. Many will give you a free sample to try before you buy. Would happily visit again||July 6, 2015
Rodrigo D||50||Everything is there!Curiosities, spices, textures, colors and flavors from around the world. You can go very far beyond the fabulous British cookies experiencing a little piece of each corner of the world gathered in this room full of eaters everywhere. Well organized, well located and full of people having fun in a lunch right there standing with a group of friends or to drink an ultra cold Paint with snacks and laughter!||July 5, 2015
thomasandrose||50||We got up early to drive to London to have a meandering breakfast at borough markets..... A superb choice! There are spectacular cheeses available, delicious sangria and sensational pies.... Actually, everything is sensational. Just go and spend a day eating and drinking at borough markets. If you ant a souvenir, grab a borough markets tea towel! They are actually really cute tea towels, and only cost £5. Easy gift or souvenir.||July 5, 2015
chargee88||20||We came on the recommendations of friends that have moved and lived in London for a while now. We tried our best to enjoy it and sampled a wide range of food:- Shellseekers (3 scallops on a bed of stir fry beanshoots and veggies - the scallops were ok but the veggies were bland and soggy)- Parrilla Grill (Brindisa Chorizo Sandwich - dry and bland)- Ginger Pig (we ordered the chicken and mushroom pie and when we got home to reheat it we discovered it was steak and mushroom :( very dry with no gravy)- Roast to Go (pork belly & crackling sandwich with bramley apple sauce - it was ok)- La tua pasta (aubergine & courgette ravioli - tasted like a weird dumpling instead of ravioli)- Boston sausage (famous award winning sausage burger - disappointing tasted worse than our supermarket gourmet sausages back home in Melbourne)- Pate Moi (handmade organic mushroom pate - amazing and delicious. The only mind blowing food we had at Borough Market)So overall, we tried 7 stalls at Borough Market and only had one fantastic experience. We feel that we've been to much better and better priced markets in other countries.||July 5, 2015
Francesco2601||50||This is undoubtedly the top food market in London.I have my favourite boutcher and fishmonger here.It is expensive but good food comes at a price!||July 5, 2015
EllensTrips||50||We visited the Borough Market after the Globe Theatre on our way to the Tower Bridge. A perfect lunch spot. Absolutely incredible variety of food vendors - any type of food that you can imagine. We went simple: bread, cheese and fruit smoothies. Our cheese vendor recommended a bread vendor. Perfect. We could have taken hours to taste all that was offered. Found a set in the courtyard near a busker playing guitar. Loved the Borough Market.||July 5, 2015
SoThenSarahSaid||40||Wasn't intending to go here initially but a tour we were on ended near here and I'm glad it did. There's so much to try it's best to go while hungry!||July 5, 2015
RoyalMetrics||40||This has been my Saturday morning destination for food shopping for years. I know this is a little bit expansive but at least you get good food quality. I typically stop by Turnips for my vegetables and fruits, Gastronomica for Italian delicatessen. There are loads of kiosks for take away food and french bakeries. I really enjoy this market!||July 5, 2015
Perm611||50||This was an off cuff visit and we throughly enjoyed it. Was crazy busy but it was around lunchtime on a Saturday, so what should I of expected? The food all looked great and we tried a few things and bought bits too. Milkshakes, mushroom pâté, sausage baps and the best piece of food.... Raclette. Everyone kept asking where we got it from. Due to the heat of the day the cheese stands smelt a bit funky out in the sun but can't wait to go back! ||July 5, 2015
joelpatrol||50||An absolute must do when visiting London. Sample plenty of cheese, meat, oils and sweets before making the tough decision of what to have for lunch from the many street food vendors. I have been a few times and eaten from many stalls and am yet to have a bad meal. Can get very crowded at times so prepare to be patient, but in the end it's worth it.||July 5, 2015
Raedward||50||Not a huge market but a good size and crammed with all sorts of delights like a mushroom stall with every conceivable type of edible fungi, a stall specialising in truffles which can be smelt before it's seen, a specialist butcher selling wild boar meats, a specialist pie stall with every type of pie from pork to pigeon and everything in between, wonderful fruits, berries, vegetables and an amazing range of different breads. If you fancy yourself as a gourmet then this is the place to stock up for your next gastronomic adventure.||July 4, 2015
Anndove||50||This is one of the best markets we have ever visited, such variety and a great venue for foodies! You can buy food to take home but also eat whilst you shop and the 'street food,' is superb! The food is eclectic and I would say one could find almost anything in the food line in this market. The market and the surrounding area just buzzes and there are wonderful pubs bars cafes and resturants in abundance in the area! If you are in the area not to be missed!||July 4, 2015
201susanw||50||If you like quality and interesting gourmet food and drink, you should go to the Borough Markets with an empty stomach!! So much to try - eat there and take some home with you!! Even if you aren't going to eat or buy, go and have look. (But I'll bet there'll be something there to tempt you!!)||July 4, 2015
May W||50||This is my favorite London market. It is the perfect place for young foodies and people traveling on a budget. we came here twice during our week in London even though it was far away from the hotel. We loved the cheese, cured meats, and cider sold here. It has great street food for sale and I would highly recommend you have luch here.||July 4, 2015
elnewong||50||If you have the vaguest interest in food you would be crazy to go yo London and not visit this gem!! It's a traditional show case of some of England's finest produce. To wonder around and see the spectacular displays of food and munch on fresh raspberries or a tub of cockles smothered on malt vinegar.... ||July 4, 2015
Igor_Zubkov||50||We came to London Bridge and went by foot to London Eye..Close to London bridge you will find this market ... just walk around , buy some fruits , maybe go for some nice dinner / wine and more.Great vibe , nice atmosphere. ||July 3, 2015
nippersUk||40||I used to work in the area prior to the market regeneration. It was a lovely day for a trip down memory lane any to see what is there now. My old lunch times would have been much better if this had been there. Great selection of food for all appetites and diets. I had delicious scallops and my husband a venison burger. We would have bought produce from some stalls but it was a very hot day and we had a train journey home. We then went for cocktails in the Shard.||July 3, 2015
salvadors691||40||Even if it's small, this market has a lot to offer. From oyster bars to regional italian cheese and iberian chorizo. The shop keepers are super nice and it's fun to talk to them and try what they offer. There are some places to have beers or pimms too. If the weather is nice, it's a great place to spend some time during lunch hour.||July 3, 2015
webtravelreview||40||We enjoyed walking around and getting some food. Be aware that you need cash pounds, no one here takes a credit card.||July 3, 2015
Teagle||40||We arrived here early as we were meeting an English relative. The place was buzzing and had everything there relating to food or drink. I would love to have this on my doorstep at home. Also for me the history and architecture in the buildings and tunnels were awesome. Take a walk outside around the market. We also caught a boat from there up to Greenwich which was handy for us. Needed more time at the market to explore.||July 3, 2015
blannanna||50||Traveling with young teenager this place hit the spot. Wonderful atmosphere and all kinds of food to choose from. Totally worth a visit to enjoy the bustle of the market!||July 2, 2015
KwinAun||40||I guess this small market would suit the local more. There are many interesting ingredients and food to be purchased. But as for tourists, you can't really do much here. A pop by visit is enough.||July 2, 2015
Nick G||50||Foodies, market lovers, people watchers and anyone looking for a great brunch or lunch should check out the Borough Market. There are some other great markets in London but the Borough Market is located near a bunch of other places of interest: Tate Modern, Vinopolis, Queen’s Walk, Tower Bridge, HMS Belfast etc.; you can easily include in a day’s self-guided tour of the area. The market is partially covered so you can even visit on rainy days.We visited shortly after opening on a Thursday and had a “market brunch” I had a Black Sausage Breakfast Bab from Rare Stra’eat and my wife had a delicious pie from Pieminister as well as cold brewed coffee from a small vendor. We had delicious Macaroons from Comptoir Gourmand (so good we went back for more..) and then got a bag of dried fruits for the road.They have a great website and all the vendors at the market were very friendly with many providing samples. I really wish I was staying somewhere with a kitchen because the quality of meat, cheeses and veggies here was excellent and I REALLY wanted to buy things to cook with. Maybe next time?||July 2, 2015
fatmadcat||50||So I can have four stomachs. Was in London for four days before visiting other parts of the UK and spent three mornings stuffing my face there.IT IS CHEESE HEAVEN.You HAVE to buy some back - be sure to pack along an air-tight bag, though. I bought a lot, including black pudding (which tasted great fried!) and smoked fish (the selection there is fabulous and cheap!)||July 2, 2015
GrOmit-y||30||A bit smaller than I expected, lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, seafood, food stalls. Great to pop in for a look||July 1, 2015
P A||40||A great variety of food from various parts of the countryand world to sample and buy.a buzzing and lively market worth a visit.||July 1, 2015
amykat1102||50||I've been to London before but this was my first time to the market and it was amazing! There were so many smells and so many great foods. It can be overwhelming with the number of people bustling but well worth the time. We went for lunch, however, you should arrive before you're hungry as that made it really difficult to decide what to eat. I would go back during all future visits to London!||July 1, 2015
Chemyn R||40||We have been several times, and we love Borough Market! Tons of great food to try, lots of samples. Breads, cheeses, fruit, veg, meat (I'm vegetarian, but I saw lots of meat if you like that...), wines, beer, so much more. Lots of food stalls for a quick meal - I usually have the vegetarian curry - outstanding. Can get VERY crowded, so be prepared to be jostled a bit.||July 1, 2015
alex4815||50||Absolutely incredible place to go! Tons of prepared food options for all tastes and flavour preferences. Additionally, the market is filled with fresh fruits, veg, bread, cheese, oils, tea and the list continues. I could spend hours here. Everything is fairly inexpensive too for the value, and many of the vendors have special sales going on for even better deals.||July 1, 2015
HowieEmbry||50||This place is amazing. So many choices and all at a reasonable price. The place is crazy busy. I tried to go on a Saturday once and way to busy. Also they day I went it was later in the afternoon and by 6:30 many stalls were closing down.||June 30, 2015
rangers723||50||This is definitely one place you must visit. The different varieties of foods is unbelievable. I have seen outdoor markets before but nothing compares to the Borough Market. ||June 30, 2015
H3Tom||50||If you love food, drinks and people - go there!Food and drinks from all over Europe. Cider and Prosecco, crocodile burger meat and porridge, Italian tomatoes and German sausages, seafood, veggies, EVERYTHING. JUST GO THERE, GET YOURSELF A GLASS OF ITALIEN WINE AND A SOME SPANISH TAPAS. enjoy life at its best. ||June 30, 2015
noob1985||50||A lot of food to choose from, with a variety from around the world. Quite cheap and the location is good too.||June 30, 2015
J150505||40||I visited the market this morning and most stalls were open for business. One has to visit on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday to find all the stalls open and to get the best out of the market. The stalls sell Spanish, Croatian, French, Indian, British food etc from meat and fish to cheese and cake. I love to browse from stall to stall and taste the free samples. What they sell is interesting and of good quality but not cheap as it is artisan food. Well worth the experience. When replete with food one can stroll along the Thames path to Westminster to use up a couple of hundred calories and enjoy the Thames. ||June 30, 2015
F1234Yorkshire||50||Visited on Saturday morning as part of a short weekend trip. Was fab, so much to choose from, every type of food, specially liked the raclette stand nad mushroom and comte pate! Only downside very busy around lunchtime so perhaps go earlier.||June 30, 2015
996marcusm||30||More like a Foodcourt, than a market. It's okay to come here, but I personally think most of the steet food markets in London are much better than the Borough Market.||June 30, 2015
Juliet C||40||Not always open when I wanted but food glorious food. Staying just up the road I was able to venture past on more than three occasions. Great fresh food, tastes, smells, good alternative to the pubs. A must visit.||June 29, 2015
Figs_Olives||40||Absolutely brilliant market worth visiting over and over again, you'll find heavenly coffee, veg, salmi, cheese as well as cooked food. A few minutes from the globe theatre and right on the river. On a Saturday it's almost impossibly busy and you can buy food but there's nowhere to eat it except standing up||June 29, 2015
Trentham_Ozlady||50||Visited this market and was amazed at the various types of foods on offer. Absolutley jammed packed with stalls selling both fresh produce and ready made meals, breads, pastries, cheses, olives, fruits, etc. We arrived about midday and the market was very busy. Made a few purchases including an old favourite, homemade turkish delight, which was rather pricey but oooh so enjoyable. Don't miss this place.||June 29, 2015
Anto32009||50||Amazing amazing amazing. You can have all types of food, drinks and desserts for a fair price. It's really delicious and a must visit.||June 29, 2015
stevej433||50||Thoroughly enjoyable afternoon spent wandering around Borough market sampling all the delicious produce from small independent traders. This place is a must for the serious foodie to explore on a visit to the Capital.||June 29, 2015
Tracey W||50||Loved the diversity of food on offer,one of the bset markets i have been to,cheeses and meats to die for.didnt dislike a thing it was all good||June 29, 2015
JessLamarr||50||This place is fantastic! It's packed full of stalls selling baked goods, cheese, charcuterie, and entrees from various different cultures. I wandered through here looking for a delicious but affordable dinner on my first evening in London, and was nearly overwhelmed by the wealth of stall options, each with its own sumptuous smell. After considering a lamb burger and paella, I finally settled on Vietnamese sweet potato curry. I got a very generous portion, along with white rice, for under five pounds - and it was delicious! The place is bigger than it seems when you first walk in - there's even a section toward the back with tables and chairs if you're not the eat-and-walk type. I could have easily spent all of my money here. I strongly encourage a visit if you're in London, whether it's for lunch, dinner, a snack between meals, or dessert. They have everything! ||June 28, 2015
thornton34||50||Borough market is a 'must see' in your list of places to visit in London, and is easy to find being situated close to Southwark Cathedral and underneath the railway arches. This is a food lovers paradise, and you can see the pleasure on peoples faces as they walk around the many stalls with the wide variety of produce on offer. You name it, they have it, and the traders I spoke to are more than happy to discuss their wares and their provenance. After a leisurely stroll along the South Bank, we stopped and picked up lunch made up from several different stalls and a delicious sangria, which we enjoyed whilst enjoying the warmth of the sun sat outside the Tate. On a nice day it just beats sitting inside a cafe or restaurant.Whether you are a tourist or doing your food shopping I would more than recommend this market, the next time I visit, I will bring a cool bag in an attempt to get more of the fresh produce home after the long journey north. ||June 28, 2015
Amanda H||40||There is so much choice for normal eaters - not a lot for me as I'm gluten free (although there was a delicious free-from bakery! But that was it) but there were plenty of places selling fresh food, hot & cold. A little pricey but nothing you wouldn't expect being in London. Definitely worth a visit!||June 28, 2015
mossigetravels||40||i love this food market. looking for cheese, oysters, fruits or anything special to prepare that wonderful meal. you´d find it here. i can spend the whole day here just tasting what the vendors have to offer. highly recommended.||June 28, 2015
34amire||50||If you visit London must put on your list got there late and hate I did. They do free tasting and I missed it. Great restaurants and bars to choose from. Wonderful atmosphere. Definitely felt like local hang out.||June 28, 2015
pominsydney||40||Wow what a fantastic place to spend the day with friends. The only challenge is choosing what to eat and drink. We decided to try a bit of everything and share. We started with a salt beef sandwich which was succulent and sublime. We drank Sangria and Pimms with the sandwich. We then spent a few hours at the Wine pantry sampling stunning English made wines.We then tried the Raclett ( hot cheese on new potatoes).What a great day out.||June 28, 2015
Catherine N||50||This place just keeps on expanding and busier than ever. Not an easy market to navigate. Unfortunately some of the roads are still open to traffic when the market is open which can make for safety issues. Prices are variable for most of the items. Would still recommend. ||June 28, 2015
Bob L||40||This is a hidden gem that I never knew existed until I was told by a local friend to go find it. I am glad I did. This is a place where food, goods, entertainment, and more converge, creating a world that must be experienced. If you like going to a marketplace, go here when you are in London. It will not dissapoint.||June 28, 2015
PeghandleMike||30||Huge variety of food choices that overloads the senses. If i could sample every stall I would live a happy man. That being said there aren't sufficient tables to accommodate the throng of eaters. Too much density of vendors and people in too little space. I know we're in the minority but had to leave. I don't relish the idea of eating standing up or sitting on the ground.||June 27, 2015
cristina4216||50||This food market is simply amazing! Cheeses, fresh fruits and vegetables, spices, olive and truffle oil, meats, cakes, candies from british and international producers. There are also many stalls offering small and cheap dishes. Go for lunch, enjoy the vibe and take a lot of pictures!||June 27, 2015
WMIM||40||Further to my earlier review, I had a good day showing some foreign acquaintances around mainly the South Bank area, including the London Eye and Tate Modern, before arriving here. They found the whole place very interesting and we enjoyed plenty of food from the various establishments. They actually found this market the best visit of the day and were surprised that something like this can be found so close to London Bridge and the City. I can appreciate their verdict because I had a good time here too.||June 27, 2015
Psychiatrist||50||This market should be on your list of places to visit during your stay in London. Numerous food stalls where you can purchase different foods and the vendors will even give you a free sample to decide if you like the product. There are several buildings which make up the market so take your time and explore. We had delicious Turkish sugar coated candies which were delicious. We also had fantastic pastries. There is great food from around the world to taste. Enjoy and come hungry when you visit.||June 27, 2015
CarolynJW29||40||I just wish I could have picked up more food to take home! Such yummy looking foodstuffs but if I had picked up any more, I wouldn't have been able to carry it! Definitely worth a visit :)||June 27, 2015
Chris F||50||We just happened to spot this market on our way to Southwark Cathedral which is right next to it. We were pleasantly surprised, it's a great bustling market with many fine foods and drink on offer. The place is very characterful with its Victorian architecture well preserved. Most of it is tucked underneath the railway arches and you can hear the trains moving overhead which I felt added to its charm. To me the market is a well preserved piece of old cockney London and is a treat to see.||June 27, 2015
JenniMalta||50||Amazing food, amazing produce & very friendly people. Great place to just wander, look & eat. Managed to eat 3 times in a few hours. ||June 27, 2015
Paul h||40||Best to get there early, we were there by 10 and it was packed by 2 you couldn't move for the people. Worth the walk around but not enjoyable if all you have is a crush of people||June 27, 2015
nr_trk||50||Fresh, beautiful food everywhere you look. This place is a foodie's dream come true. Don't miss it if you are in London!||June 27, 2015
happyvistor||40||Really enjoyed our visit to borough market amazing food recommended by a friend worth a visit lots of choice of food to eat and produce to buy ||June 27, 2015
5_Frosts||40||This is a great place to visit to sample cheeses, spices, meats, candies, and so many other things. Mosst of the stalls are built-in and offer samples. At lunch time there were numerous places to choose from, but there are very few places to sit or find drinks.||June 26, 2015
Dean M||50||If you like food this is the place for you!!! Awesome fresh produce- fruit & veg, cakes, cured meats..if you want lunch here there fresh seafood, curries, zebra burgers the lot!!! Great buzz about the place! We Keep coming back.||June 26, 2015
Jste011||50||Have been told about this market it the past but never managed to get there, what a glorious foodie surprise. The stalls are beautifully presented with high quality mouth watering goods. Take your camera with you as its a really nice place to get some good shots. You shouldn't walk away hungry.||June 26, 2015
Kosher22||40||My son wanted me to join him for his birthday and he wanted to spend it here. I've been a number of times and really enjoy the atmosphere. A huge variety of market stalls selling fresh food from vegetables to Iberico Ham. Many stalls selling local British cheeses, all the cheese sellers are pleased to describe their wares and cut you off a sample. My favourite cheese seller in the market is Neals Yard, it's a proper shop, just on the fringe. The staff there are great and very knowledgable, they care about their products and are very generous with their samples. Great cheeses and you select the size you want to purchase. A very lively place, under cover, so even if the weather is bad, you'll not notice. One other thing to mention is the abundance of 'fast food' stalls, but not your typical fare. Egyptian street food, Salt beef sandwiches, Paella. It's all there and the choices are fantastic. A real 'foodie' heaven. Highly recommended!||June 25, 2015
Ashley m||50||Great and diverse food experience! Fish n chips to zebra burgers, wow! Lots of free samples and after the market closes, there are several pubs and restaurants open until late. Ethiopian, Indian, Spanish, French, Turkish, Greek and English foods and more are all wonderfully represented here. Meat pies, cheeses, dried sausages, fruits , vegetables, ice cream, cakes, honey, sangria and more! A short walk from London Bridge. ...don't miss it!||June 25, 2015
Simon B||50||Visited during a walk along South Bank, timed perfectly for Saturday lunchtime. Very busy but this added to the experience and atmosphere. Food was wonderful (Malaysian chicken curry) and inexpensive compared to usual 'London prices'.Don't miss Borough Market if you're passing by!||June 25, 2015
ctaylor0159||40||I have to admit, after reading these reviews on TripAdvisor, I expected the Borough market to be much larger than it actually is. It has a nice mixture of different ready to eat types of foods as well as other market-type items for sale. I had the Indian food and it was fabulous. It does get busier as mid lunch time gets nearer, so going early will help with the lines. However, the lines really weren't that long even at the busiest time of the day when I went this week.||June 25, 2015
pontikiif||50||The market is a foodies haven!!!!A variety of dishes from all over the world make the market a perfect place for lunch. Try the different kinds of mustards and a great variety of cheese and sausages.Deffinatelly get some chocolate or cheesecake for disert ||June 25, 2015
Treesrgreenr||50||Borough Market has an atmosphere that you cannot beat. Market traders, tourists and regulars are brought together to give London town a unique place to taste and buy quality food. It never fails to impress, even if you only want a loaf of bread.Take a camera, there are so many things to photograph, the food, the traders and people from all walks of life tasting all that Borough Market has to offer.Many of the stalls are selling at a premium, but I guarantee you will get carried away with the atmosphere and come home with a bag stocked full of goodies. If nothing else, get some cheese and bread or cold meats for tea time - and make the day last even longer. And Roast which sits above the market is not cheap but does a cracking breakfast (silver service).||June 25, 2015
davidarf||50||After a long day of walking and sightseeing, this is the perfect place to stop for a bite. Easily accessible and a variety of food to choose from! Highly recommended to visit this place||June 24, 2015
Hazwan||40||This market is bustling with stalls selling various items especially fresh food or cooked food, so there are plenty to sample and try. A good place to walk through and watch people bargain with the stall helpers.||June 23, 2015
OnandelBangkok||50||Great fresh food market. Go around 11am to beat the crowds to the section that serves ready-to-eat food. There is Indian, Thai, Burgers, sausage sandwiches and all sorts of other goodies. Grab something to eat and in the church yard next food. The fresh food section is fantastic as well. Really great top-end fruit, vegetables, seafood, gourmet butchers, cheese shops, bread, truffles, jams, oils, spices....and on and on.||June 23, 2015
Marina C||40||Open on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, it makes a great place to enjoy some delicious food. Also nice just to wander around and perhaps buy great ingredients for a home cooked dinner or lunch.||June 23, 2015
ECJ1968||50||Came here for lunch and a bit of a sight see. There were wonderful stalls and lots of food to pick from. Highly recommended.||June 23, 2015
Sonia T||40||I love Borough Market. Though the food can be quite pricy but the experience and vibes are great. It is also close to Tower Bridge, Big Ben and the London Eye. I would recommend it if you're here visiting.||June 23, 2015
Monika L||50||Its definately my favourite place for lunch time in London! I just love it ♡♡♡ Before actually choosing what to eat you can try for free many different delicious food types! My favourite is the duck roll and meringue for dessert. But there is so meny other type of food that it is just impossible to stop eating ;) Food from nearly each europian country ♡ Amazing ♡||June 23, 2015
TimescapesKent||50||A Victorian fruit and veg market transformed into a 21st Century destination venue. Situated close to London Bridge Station and the South Bank the market is a 'foodies' dream and caters for carnivores and vegetarians alike. From cheese and pasta, to hog roast and cider you can graze all day. Take plenty of cash and check opening times. ||June 23, 2015
littletraveller85||50||This place has a great vibe. So many people selling different things, most produced locally. The food stalls are excellent, so much choice. Be prepared to queue a while for some of the stands, the food is worth the wait though. Has interesting character. Worth a visit, particularly on a Saturday when it's the busiest.||June 23, 2015
Ruth B||50||I went here on a Saturday morning, and yes, it was crowded. Just breathe and make the crowd a part of the experience.Fabulous displays of gourmet deli items (cheeses and small goods), tempting breads, cakes and pastries, magnificent fresh fruit and vegetables, interesting sweets, wines - a foodie heaven. Most places offer a taste of their wares. There were plenty of places offering gluten free choices too, which is wonderful for those of us who need that. Plus plenty of different stalls selling a wide range of lunch and snack foods. I also enjoyed a magnificent cup of 'builder's tea' for just £1 - bargain! This is a must visit place - you will be able to stock up on delicious morsels to sustain your day as well as experience the whole vibe.||June 23, 2015
Ron S||40||So much fun! Borough market is near Tate Modern so actually you can make a plan like: Visiting Tate Modern in the moring and go to Borough Market on foot( abt 10 mins)and enjoy your lunch THERE, they got many food stands and small beer house / fresh fruits / vegetable. Remember Borough Market officially close around 18:00 (but actually, the food stands close around 17:30) ||June 22, 2015
Emily P||50||Borough Market is the most exciting place for food in London! Every Friday morning I'd spend my time browsing, sampling, and enjoying the best food London has to offer.||June 22, 2015
GSimone77||50||The Borough Market is absolutely worth a visit especially if your a foodie. The selection of food is unlike anything I have ever experienced. You must get here and arrive hungry!!||June 22, 2015
Lucy H||50||A fantastic market that provides a range of food and delicacies for all to enjoy.A great family day out, and you can spend the majority of the day walking around the stalls and enjoying a drink in the surrounding coffee shops and pubs.It does get busy so I suggest arriving early and with an empty stomach.You must try the chilli squid! FANTASTIC!Also great to buy local produce, with a large selection of fruit and beg.Bring your camera for some great pics and also a carrier for all the purchased products.||June 22, 2015
jayakumarr||30||If you are foodie and want to taste the local stuff, this is the place to go. Unfortunately, most of the food stalls had used very low quality ingredients. For example, the Focasia bread we tried, by the time we got to the hotel in the evening, it was crisp and hard. My wife was in the baking industry and she could say the yeast and other ingredients used were of very low quality. If you are buying something, better finish it right there so you don't feel the low quality stuff used. Quality of food vs. price, I would give this place a 2/5.||June 22, 2015
Mark B||50||This place is just brilliant. So much selection of fruit & veg, cakes, biscuits, fish, cheese, curry, burgers, bread plus loads more. It can get quite busy on a Saturday but it really is worth a visit. I loved this place||June 21, 2015
aliceaeb||40||It was busy enough at 9.30 but you could actually see eveything and move around comfortably. Extensive and impressive range of food, great atmosphere. For all those who seem to think its overpriced its not by market standards and having a freind who has a pitch for part of the year yoy must understand how expensive the pitches are so prices need to be higher than normal/shops to make some profit. Don't go for cheapnesss go for atmostphere.||June 21, 2015
Wolliedog||50||This place is amazing - all "Foodies" out there will love it. We made the mistake of having breakfast at our Hotel then going to the Market. Next time we will go on an empty stomach and have breakfast there - can't wait for January 2016!||June 21, 2015
Anne C Udengaar... C||50||If you are a foodie there is no place in London as captivating as Borough Market. Here you can find everything your heart desires from fresh fruit and vegetables to salami, wine and baked goods; all brought to the market by small vendors who are passionate about what they do, and who are more than willing to guide you through, and let you taste the products they've got. It's definitely also worth mentioning that the building, the market is located in, is an absolutely stunning market hall from the 19th century which adds a level of charm and authenticity to the market, you don't find very often. Lastly I would like to recommend visiting the market around lunch time, as there are a wide selection of delicious and freshly made lunches on offer.Remember to bring cash as almost none of the vendors accept cards!||June 21, 2015
JaneB74||50||Loved the market. Great for food and photography junkies alike. It is easy to find and we spent a good couple of hours there tasting the fares.||June 21, 2015
Niffy_10||10||Our daughter suggested we go to the markets on our last visit to London. We had been tho London frequently but never to the markets. Quite frankly we found them disappointing. The food was average or below average and certainly overpriced.||June 21, 2015
LittleRachD||40||How did I not know this place existed? The years I've been coming to London and until yesterday had no idea about this place. Wow! Go early as it does get very, very busy. So much fresh food. Many stalls cooking all sorts of different world foods. The smell of foods drags you in and keeps you there. There are some great juice bars too. Lovely atmosphere. Genuinely a brilliant place to visit and shop. ||June 20, 2015
jbv91||50||Bought fresh juice here and walked around see what people were selling. It was a lovely experience. Writing this makes me wish I could go back there! ||June 20, 2015
KellyD6646||40||Based on Trip Advisor reviews and a friends recommendation my husband and I went to the market for lunch. It's a bit overwhelming, so many options to choose from and not laid out the best way, so come with lots of patiences! From Wagyu burgers to Asian, cheese and wine and desserts galore there was plenty of food. I could definitely go there every day and try something new. Not a place to bring a stroller, super crowded for that. ||June 20, 2015
AAF-ME-TEMPO||50||Amazing display of meats, fruits, and vegetables. The prepared foods are amazing and delicious (too many to remember). Make sure you come hungry!||June 20, 2015
Dreamz12||10||We have been visited there recently. We had salted beef and paella. They don't taste any good! Salted beef is too dry and the bread is a bit hard. Paella don't taste any flavour at all and the portion is so small. Defiantly not worth £6.50 at all.I would suggest to go to brick lane on Sunday which is much better food! You have to have the salted beef from there!! So much better and it's only 3.70!||June 20, 2015
NoFranchisesAllowed||50||This was recommended by a friend who recently visited London. My daughter had already been and took me as she LOVED IT. The vendors were very friendly. The amount of food vendors and samples was unbelievable, you could go hungry and fill up. You can sample foods, purchase, eat a meal, drink! We bought food to take back to the hotel, meats, cheeses, bread, olives. They cut it for us. We also bought homeade prepared pasta as take out to take back to the hotel as well. We bought Pimms cups to sip while we walked and shopped. It was a Saturday afternoon and very very crowded, but it's so big, it seems you can still move around despite the crowds. This is worth a stop by.||June 20, 2015
art1510||50||Came here to get the freshes food and best service!! Had a shrimp wrap and cider beer that was fantastic! Then had too many oysters and some marys :-) ! Glad to have found this gem and will recomeded my friends and family here. ||June 19, 2015
JaR_55_56||50||Its a true feast for the eyes(and stomach).Just looking around at the display of fruits, veggies, meats,cheeses ,cakes etc are a treat enough.No seating place to eat however so can be tricky with kids.Try the pulled pork and salted beef sandwich.I love them.Theres so much to see and eat.You need to walk around all the stalls and then pick what you would like to try.||June 18, 2015
mireilletoyn||50||This is a fantastic place to go to if you are a big foodie like me. I could spend hours going round all the stalls - From chutney to goats ice cream to nougat to italian cured meats. It's all the top quality food companies under one roof - Absolutely fantastic! I highly recommend going round to have a look at what's on offer throughout the market first - Then deciding what you fancy. It's a fab place to pick up any birthday presents or dinner party thank you gifts. I'm never disappointed by Borough Market.||June 18, 2015
greggc90||40||One of the best markets in London with some brilliant food stalls.A couple of the stalls sell brownies, massive chocolate brownies that taste incredible.There's also Mountains Boston Sausage which do great breakfast bap - Boston sausage burger, fried egg and hollandaise sauce.It's one of the more popular markets for tourists so expect it to be pretty busy whatever time young go.||June 17, 2015
jennifer D||50||What a lot great place to see, it has lots of shopping stalls and eateries, with fantastic choices of unusual foods, the are quiet areas to sit in peace, enjoy you food or drink or chill and relax.||June 17, 2015
cactusBadger||50||We've gone twice to this market 5 years a part. One of our favorite things to do in London and free unless you buy something, which you will.Many kiosks of venders selling almost anything imaginable. Zebra hamburger patties? Try finding that at your Krogers.Do not miss trying the toasted cheese sandwiches. It is located over near the small church, We heard about this vendor from one of Samantha Brown's Travel shows. Definitely one of the best sandwiches we've ever had and for only 6 pounds. But low cal it is NOT!But there are many other worthy food and fruit and cheese venders as well. Too many to try.It is not open every day and a bit hard to find. It is open Thursdays. To reach it walk east along the south bank of the Thames. It is not far past the Globe Theater and a few blocks south.By the way the small church adjacent to Borough Market was William Shakespeare's boyhood church.||June 17, 2015
Brent T||50||This is by far my favourite place in London. It is a foodie's dream. On weekends, it gets extremely busy, but it still worth the visit. Go on an empty stomach, and be prepared to make some tough decisions, because there are so many amazing food options, that you won't know what to do with yourself. I've tried a number of different vendors, and have yet to be disappointed. You honestly cannot go wrong||June 17, 2015
Hayanm||50||I have been to London twice and Borough Market still by far the highlit of my holiday after Camden town. The best place to enjoy the street food in London . My fav is the pie shop at the beginning of the market. You must stop at the Cuban bar too. Start your day around the London Bridge and head to borough market for lunch. Remember it closes around 4pm. So if you need a hot delicious pie, you need to be there around 2pm. Cannot wait to come back again. Plenty of English bars around for some quality pale Ale :) ||June 17, 2015
TravellerFromNWales||50||Character, atmosphere, bustle, array of food, this historic market has it all! Everybody should go and experience the market, but check the website first to make sure it's open when you want to go. It tends to be quieter early in the day and there's plenty to choose from for breakfast. Shop around for juice there though, and if you don't see what you want, ask the stall holders, they're generally very helpful.Pieminister is a must do for all pie lovers and the bacon, sausage and burgers from North Field Farm are tasty and filling.A foodies paradise in the shadow of the Cathedral, go and enjoy!||June 16, 2015
906shellyj||50||Yum!! The food displays here are amazing. Wonderful cheeses, cold meats, vegetables, oils and amazing breads and cakes. Go early around 10.30 am to avoid the lunch hour rush. It's a mix of locals, business people in suits and tourists. Very crowded at lunch time until about 2pm. Well worth a visit. Grab your favourite international street food or take a basket and gather items for your own picnic. Follow up afterward with a delicious icecream. A definite must do when in London ! ||June 16, 2015
Veronica A||50||A must-do while in London. Make sure to some starving because you will eat your way through it, like we did!. I wrote a blog post on my most recent visit to Borough Market. Check it out: http://bit.ly/boroughmkt||June 16, 2015
NicD440||40||It really is a food lovers paradise. Be warned, you will be fighting the crowds, but the variety and quality of the food more than makes up for the lack of room to breathe||June 16, 2015
wyotravels||50||Of all the markets I've visited in London (Spitalfields, Camden, and more) this was my favorite. It's all about food - fresh produce, bread, meats, cheeses, flavored oils and vinegars, beers, wines. We were sad that we had already eaten when we arrived because there were so many choices of ready to eat food. Perfect place, too, to gather supplies for an impromptu picnic along the Thames. ||June 15, 2015
Tracy W||50||You could visit here every week for a year and try something different. I try to get there on a Friday at 11am before the lunchtime rush and enjoy checking out the stalls, the taste testers and sitting watching people with a coffee in hand. It does get very busy once midday hits so if you can, know what you are going to have and join the que. You have to embrace the hustle and bustle and be prepared to wait for food and then squeeze onto a step near the beautiful church and people watch. The sky seems blue most of the time. When its raining its a bit more tricky balancing food in the inside gazebo section. Food great, good drinks and love the mixture of suits, tourists and everyone else that is lucky enough to be out in the middle of the day. A must to experience and if you can grab some portuguese tarts to take home. Yum!||June 15, 2015
Magnus1968||40||Amazing variety of stores and food offerings with literally anything and everything available. Most offerings are reasonably priced and we had three different meals (noodles, duck sandwich, Turkish titbits) all of which were absolutely delicious. the only reason why it gets 4 stars rather than 5 was that It was extremely busy and a bit of a bun fight a times to get served at the more popular counters even with so many places and dishes on offer. And it's so big it can be hard to keep track of your bearings if trying to retrace your footsteps to stall which appealed during an initial browse! All that said, well worth a visit and bound to be something there for everyone to enjoy.||June 15, 2015
Andrew C||50||This is usually open from Wednesday to Saturday each week, and it is fun to wander around in the crowds and see what there is on offer. If you are hungry there is a wide variety of choice of things to eat and drink. Or you can try and perhaps but some interesting things to take home.||June 15, 2015
JohnT641||40||If you like adventure, this market will be for you. It has so many choices from Cheese, fine sausage's, Truffles, fine wines,outstanding fruits and vegetable. There were 40+ stands sell from Grill cheese,Grill sausages, to scotcheggs, Tacos, this will be the place for you spend 3-4 hours.||June 15, 2015
jcd60||50||We loved visiting this market, so much to see, smell & taste. I particularly love the amaretti biscuits from one of the stalls. It's easy to spend a lot of money on foodie things here.||June 15, 2015
Omeed T||40||Just been reading some of the "poor" and "terrible" comments about this market and felt so incensed by the remarks, mostly from provincial visitors into London expecting to find a bargain there, that I felt I had to add my own comments!Borough market is one of the oldest food markets in London. It's not the kind of market you'd go to find 10 bargain chickens for the price of 1! This is a novelty market where you'd find top quality rare coffees, wild truffles, novelty cheeses, chocolates etc. it is expensive, hence my 4 star rating rather than 5. Think of it more as Harrod's or Selfridge's food hall, rather than Grimsby fish market! This is where you go to have kangaroo steak sandwiches, oysters and organic ciders. It does get busy, especially at lunchtimes, a testament to the variety of freshly made foods on offer. Expect to pay £10-15 for a standing lunch which could range from paellas, to seafood, various hot/cold sandwiches, or more if you opt for one of the cafes or restaurants. If you're clever, you'd walk through the market, trying different dishes from around the world and get your fill for less than £20. And for an extra £30-40 you could take home some foods that you've never had or tried before! Alternatively, you could save yourself a lot of money by doing your shopping from your local supermarket and make yourself a pilchard sandwich for 50p!I recommend this market - give it a go and live a little. Life's too short!||June 15, 2015
tinglebelle||50||We went to Borough Market initially as a just-for-fun visit. We couldn't help but return for a second time after that. Huge variety of market foods that you can choose from. Many shops selling seafood, cheeses, sausages, fruits and produce. Our first wrap was from Applebee's. You can't miss it as it's located near the main entrance within a seafood restaurant. Their cajun prawn and fish wrap was fantastic. At 5 pounds each, I'd say it was a good buy. Wrap was loaded with fresh fish and prawns. So good we went back just for it. Another favourite was the duck confit sandwich. Duck was crispy and fragrant. Finally, do not miss the roast hog roll situated at the left of the market. Head all the way in and you should see a stretch of stalls after the restaurants. There was a long queue for this (not surprising). Roll came stuffed with generous serving of roast pork. Fantastic. Much to our disappointment, the stall was replaced by another the following Saturday. Note: Only go on Wednesday to Saturday because that's when the full market is available. Make sure you head to Borough Market at least twice because some stalls do get swapped! The market is right outside London Bridge train station.||June 15, 2015
SoulgirlCarnforth||50||We went to Borough Market on a weekend visit to London with friends, it was just down some steps before you walk over London Bridge and down the road from London Bridge Station. What an atmosphere it was really buzzing, all the many different food stalls serving food from all over the world, the smells were amazing. The fresh fruit and veg stalls had things on that we had never seen before and the cheese stalls were all giving samples away absolutely yummy. There was also lots of fresh fish stalls with oysters, languistines, lobsters, monkfish and so much more, we could have spent a fortune and would have if we had not been staying in London for the day, especially carrying fish around all day in the heat.We would absolutely recommended going, the Golden Hinde is moored up there too and we had a great breakfast at Bills near the Clink museum just go and soak up the atmosphere. ||June 15, 2015
CMickell||40||Basically just a food market but for some reason this has become a real tourist attraction. The variety and quality of food is amazing and if your looking for cheap lunch options there's lots to choose from. A good bet if visiting the nearby Shard.||June 14, 2015
Sue_e_sue||50||We've visited here twice now and it's been brilliant both times. The second time we went prepared with lots of bags and made sure we bought what we wanted as we saw the items so we weren't disappointed. Go early - it gets absolutely rammed near to lunchtime. Everyone is really friendly in there and they really want you to enjoy the experience. There's loads of samples to try - the first time we went we had so many samples we couldn't fit any lunch in, so beware! Looking forward to going again.||June 13, 2015
Jaja000||50||Great large foodmarket, a few hundred meters from the riverside. Locals will grab there lunch here during lunch break at the office. We tried the Etiopian meal and a sandwich pulled porcBoth great for ~5GBP.Nice to stroll around and buy some food to bring home, at least a lit cheaper than Fortnum & Mason.||June 13, 2015
Rhoward2||50||I love visiting this market and wandering through all the various food and produce stalls. There are lots of place to get something for lunch (and don't forget the pastries for dessert). If it's a nice day, go outside next to the church and eat in the sunshine. If not, there are tables inside.||June 13, 2015
ModeenW||50||Go early - go hungry - and plan to spend some time enjoying the atmosphere and the amazing food choices. It's awesome!||June 13, 2015
dr6633||50||We found this marked accidently and were so glad we did. The market is open all week and if you're hungry, you shold definitely visit there for lunch. There are many many options and nice Vegan stands. ||June 13, 2015
dr-lucifer||50||By far one of the best markets I've been to.super friendly shops, very cozy, reasonable prices, lovely chocolates.etc..a tiny garden and chairs worth a cup of coffee.||June 12, 2015
castironskillet||50||I ate lunch here for four days straight and averaged eating from 4 shops/ stands per meal (including desert). I managed to never eat from the same place twice, and was never disappointment by the food, although I really don't want to know how much I spent here. Everything was excellent. When I was there, the market was only partially open on Mondays and Tuesdays, however even on those days there was still plenty open. However, I highly recommend visiting at least once when everything is open. Only complaint is that they stand to make more seating available.||June 12, 2015
VinceVW||50||The market has lots of varieties of food from all over the world. There is a section for cakes, pastries, fruits, seafood, cheese, truffles, breads and street food from Africa.Do not miss this place if you are in London.||June 12, 2015
rzile||40||Great array of food stalls... The ones we tried had great tastes and a brill little oyster bar with £1.50 a pop! Bargain! I expected more fresh produce stalls but the ones that were there sold great rainbow of tomatoes.On a pleasant day a great hangout in London...||June 12, 2015
Samm A||50||My friend and I followed our noses in the wonderful aroma of the food cooked in the markets they had delicious organic and home made delicacies that are far more better then some restaurants I've been to ! The rustic feel of the market also was a highlight ! Must visit ! ||June 11, 2015
Sarah W||50||Brilliant! We make sure we go every time w take a trip to the big smoke! So much to see, smell, taste. Something for every palette and just when you think you've seen every stall you discover you haven't! ||June 11, 2015
Inbal L||40||Good variation of foods, nice atmosphere and helpful sellers.Not enough public seating when lunch time crowds are gathering. Worth a visit!||June 10, 2015
Tourist-Dean||50||Lots of fantastic finds in this huge market, we stumbled upon this by chance on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed. All the vendors were very friendly and recommend for a quieter visit to stop in during the week. Definitely on our list of places to stop in during the week.||June 10, 2015
SMD919||40||I couldn't decide where to go first. Absolutely a heaven for food. Delicious cheese, bread, chocolate, oil, olives, produce. Made a deliciousdinner for my hosts after visiting here.||June 10, 2015
Tan J||30||Spoilt for choice in the food market!But I didn't have the best street food here... The place was very crowded, and I personally preferred the other markets that I went to... This one is abit too touristy:/ But still go down to the borough market to feel the atmosphere!:)||June 9, 2015
mike e||50||Well, what more can I say other than that we love this market, especially Pie Minister. The cider man and his barrels of wonder are always a welcome sight. We had to try the Scottish beef burgers and they were fabulous. This market is usually kicking it and it is busy, so eat where you can and you may spill over next door at Southwark Cathedral and munch. The famous grilled cheese sandwiches are ok, not stellar. There is a candy lady who sells nice licorice, and sweets are in abundance all over the place. This is our favorite food market and is a "must eat." It is easily walked to from London Bridge Station. Oh, weekends are the best days.||June 9, 2015
CarlitaVel||40||This market has everything, as a foodie, particularly a cheese and meat lover you can get lost in all the handmade food, there's something to see, try and eat on every corner. Don't miss the pig on a spit and the Ethiopian food! ||June 9, 2015
Mattbtravelin||50||Sought out this food market on a Monday afternoon after seeing it on TripAdvisor. Not all the stalls were open but still an impressive and diverse selection of meats, sweets, cheeses, baked goods and food made to order. Try the Ethiopian food stall - delicious. Sat in the adjacent cathedral courtyard with many others but there is also an enclosed glass atrium with tables. May go back today to try Turkish Delight. Great place for a meal on the go.||June 8, 2015
fiona229||50||Quick trip here en route to a work meeting. Bought lots of great spices, salami and some samphire. I love this place. However there were lots,of,people just photographing things and not buying anything. If you go to look around please support the traders. There is a lot of great stuff much of it at fair prices. Had I not had a flight to take I would have been tempted by the saddle,of hare and some of the amazing cheese.||June 8, 2015
Diveboy77||40||Great market available so don't miss a visit.Great selection on offer so definitely try something varied and you wont be disappointed.Wild Boar is a winner!||June 8, 2015
nicolebL9362IZ||50||We visited Borough Market on Saturday for the first time and were amazed. The fresh food choice is unbelievable. Most stalls have tasters to try before you by. I would recorded going to the market with an empty stomach as there is plenty to go at. ||June 8, 2015
Christinavincenzi||50||Would come here every week if we could. The atmosphere, the smells, the hustle & bustle, the food. We love everything about Borough Market. It's all so fresh, so lively and friendly.||June 8, 2015
beverley w||40||Fantastic atmosphere in a very busy market full of sights, sounds and smells of all sorts of fruit, veg and foods galore! Spent nearly 2 hours wandering and tasting!||June 7, 2015
judithgoh||40||Great variety of food and they all look delicious! The stall owners were friendly which made the whole experience even more enjoyable. Do try the big cookies and the bread in the market.||June 7, 2015
WannabeW1||50||The market has a really wonderful selection of fresh produce and a nice variety of freshly made foods. Lots of great ethnic foods stands offer up some delicious options for a nice lunch. Juice stands offer refreshing and healthy variations for everyone. I love all of the fresh-baked goods as well! There are some fine coffees and teas as well, always nice to have on hand! Just a really lovely spot, makes for a lovely experience for any foodie out there!||June 7, 2015
youke_worldwide||50||I thought a market would be boring but the hustle and the bustle of the market was amazing. Please come on an empty stomach because your senses will be fully tantalized by the vast amounts of food available. There are cheeses and meat and coffee and fruit and drinks such as sangria. Then there is there are the burgers, olives, bread and the donuts etc. Everything looked so good. Even if you are a tourist and can't buy fresh produce there are tons of things for you. ||June 7, 2015
Bekraaw||50||We didn't actually know about this market until we were introduced to it on a tour, however we just had to go back the next day so that we could experience it properly for ourselves in full!The market is busy, and you can quickly get swept up in the hustle and bustle, but this is just what you want from a market. You can tell that it is one of the original markets in London and there is so much to see and take in.The street food is incredible and there is so much more that you could buy and take away with you. I can imagine that it is really easy to spend a lot of money in this market, but it would definitely be money well spent.It is definitely something that you need to visit at least once whilst you're in London.||June 6, 2015
SteveDELIWEAR||50||An experience not to be missed. Every imaginable fresh food, wines, oils, bakery goods and prepared foods. Beyond crowded but a fantastic experience.||June 6, 2015
am08540||50||A great place to visit. Lots of food stands. Fresh everything: fruit, fish, meats, bread. Great food stands with hot sandwiches, thai, exotic. If you are a bit concerned about being around lots of people with little room to move, this is not for you. If you have little ones that need a pram/stroller either leave it at home or come during a weekday.||June 6, 2015
Julie H||40||Very crowded, even on a weekday, but worth it. Borough Market offers a very wide variety of food to eat as you browse. So much to see! And when you're done, pop into Southwark Cathedral next door--it is the oldest cathedral church building in London. No charge to visit, and it was virtually empty when we were there. Then walk across London Bridge for an excellent view of Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.||June 6, 2015
195jeffs||50||There is a great selection of places to grab lunch here, or food to cook back at home. Well worth visiting just to see it all and to grab a snack.||June 6, 2015
Christopher K||50||We had great fun picking up bread, cheese, and sausage for a picnic in the park later that day. Merchants are very interesting, knowledgeable, and even interesting!||June 5, 2015
Dorabella G||50||Absolutely love this market, came in to London and so pleased my friend took me, everyone happy trying different foods, the smells are amazing, and spice mountain I could have spent a lot of money and rose petal jams from the Turkish deli just lovely||June 5, 2015
alexandrac151||40||Full of people but a great place to get a nice lunch and experience a bit of British culture. There was a lot of choice and all for a pretty decent price, I had a gourmet burger for 8 pounds.I would totally shop here if I had a nice dinner to prepare too.||June 5, 2015
big-blue-eyes||40||Lively market, so many choices of things to eat. So much colour very vibrant. Enjoyable visit not too busy on a week day. I loved the market building with the old pub inside and the railway lines overhead. ||June 5, 2015
F8772QFkellyc||50||Went there with my daughter who came over from the states and we were in heaven! Toasted Cheese and Parma Ham sandwich's amazing! Oysters Fab, Cheeses of every kind! So so many lovely things and all the stalls are very happy to help and have you sample. The Cider was great and the atmosphere was terrific! A Must Visit for anyone coming to London!||June 4, 2015
Mullers50||50||Vibrant and busy! What a great place to sample and buy all kinds of food, fruit and veg. Combine this with several goods pubs and so much choice of food and you'll want to visit again and again. It's only a short walk from London Bridge Station too.||June 4, 2015
Joanna381||30||I can understand why people go here, but I won't any longer. 10 years ago we would go often as you could get good food (either from the markets or the bars) for reasonably prices. It has now become a tourist trap. It is expensive and isn't exciting. We no longer go. If you fancy a busy vibe then it's worth going. But if you want good quality food, go elsewhere ||June 4, 2015
Chris B||50||The toasted cheese sandwich from Kappacasein is worth a visit to the Market. However, there are so many interesting shops in the market and the variety is incredible. Highly recommended.||June 4, 2015
Ryan W||40||Very fresh produce. Good place to pick up a quick bite if staying near the area, before hitting other attractions, or for stocking up on groceries. Some snacks for gifts (e.g. chocolates) can be sourced in the area as well.||June 3, 2015
Jocelyn Z||50||It means that we attend the market A LOT. Our favourite place in all London and without doubt THE BEST market in the country. Fridays and Saturdays tip : go early and go hungry !! You can buy a bottle of bubbly or wine at Borough Wines and walk around enjoying it while perusing the stalls and trying different food from all over the world. First class produce too. Bring a rucksack to carry the million things you will buy. An excellent way to spend a whole day for sure. Open Wed to Saturday. ||June 3, 2015
seawardfox||50||What an great market....We ate and ate.....Friendly vendors...outstanding cheeses,Caribbean Cuisine,meat pies...A must visit if you are a foodie!||June 3, 2015
Stephanie M||50||The number one place to visit if you love a foodie treat. Never have I seen such an enormous array of dishes to feast on. As well as purchasing a plate of food they also sell mouth watering sandwiches. I had a salt beef sandwich on my last visit which was packed with meat and delicious too. Also make a bee line over to the Farmers area and try all the homemade products. We always end up buying the handmade mushroom pate...problem is we never buy enough and usually scoff it when we get home with some fresh crusty bread ( also bought in the market ). I would highly recommend a visit if only to try all the free give-a-way... try before you buy.... samples of yummy goodies.||June 3, 2015
237sama||40||I live in London but I've never visited this place before. I really enjoyed walking around and seeing all the different types of food for sale. There's a whole lot of cheese but delicious meals too. I liked the Wild Highland Verison Steak Burger. Be prepared to do a lot of tasting around the stalls as there are lots of friendly people trying to sell you their tasty food.||June 3, 2015
AlexEH18||40||There are some really nice mini restaurants actually, as well as takeaway places. It does generally have that London feel to it too. Although this is a place that you should go to, I don't recommend going there for a day, I think you should have a look around if you're passing by.||June 2, 2015
SarahH878||50||The most wonderful food market selling everything from meat and cheese, to artisan bread and hand made pasta, lots of samples to try and food to eat already cooked||June 1, 2015
gammish||50||After a big morn at the Tower, we walked across London Bridge for lunch at Borough Market on a busy Saturday. Glad we did! Daughter and I shared the Minister Pie - AWESOME! Son went for a huge sausage burger that was delicious and spouse ate a Korean Po Boy - looked good but too fatty for me. We shared some chips and I had a few pints. Crowd watching entertainment and what more could you ask for? I bought some spices too! ||June 1, 2015
Kerrypanda||40||Loads to see and do at this market just south of the river. Plenty of tourist stuff nut also great street food and stalls for the regulars. Best to visit at weekend or Thursday/ Friday to see the best of it.||June 1, 2015
DaveSimon||50||If you're visiting London try and make a Saturday morning in this amazing place. A foodies heaven, try everything on offer but don't be tempted to eat the first mouth-watering thing you see. Absolutely brilliant place to visit - don't miss it ||May 31, 2015
isaura2015||50||Great atmosphere and street food. Frequented by locals and tourists alike. Well worth a visit when in london.||May 31, 2015
Docmatt||50||Not going to borough market after the Shard is like going on a space ship to the moon but forgetting to get out and go for a walk on it. Bear in mind very busy at the weekend but just go there for the freshest of food and drink and little to those trains going over you ahead and close your eyes thinking you could be in the 1800's. Marvellous!!||May 31, 2015
jakkih176||50||so much to see - go hungry, there s so much food to choose from! Loads of street food to eat on the spot, or buy some of the amazing goods from the stalls. ||May 31, 2015
Jiemi G||50||My favourite spot in London - I would live around Borough Market if I could. Tons of good food from cheese sandwiches, German hot dogs, to fish and chips and shrimp wraps. Be sure to go on an empty stomach. You could easily eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there (although the market closes around 5pm). There's a restaurant in there called Applebee's, not the American Applebee. They sell you fresh fish, and you could take it home and cook it or they would cook it on the spot however you like it. Fantastic idea!||May 31, 2015
JerseyBoy75||50||One of my must visits every time I'm in London even though everything is on the pricey side. There is a fantastic range of places to buy cheese. Also there is a very good stall serving a great range of bottled beers, it's called Utobeer.||May 31, 2015
BobH625||50||Feast your eyes, Inhale the aroma's, awaken your tastebuds, enjoy the food, embrace the atmosphere, engage in the banter, Borough Market has something for every foodie....Can't wait to visit again!||May 31, 2015
ClareMcK||50||I am really lucky to work just across the road in Park Street so I am writing this review as somewhat of a regular.Walking through the market at 8am on my way to the office I see, hear and smell the delights of the market as the traders set up for the busy days ahead. Note that on Mondays most stalls are closed. Tuesday is a little busier and then bam...Wednesday the market is in full swing. Last week I ate at lunch at Koshari, an Egyptian street food stall. I had a vegetarian pot of chickpeas and veggies for £4.50 which was flavoursome and to die for. I ended my week with a lovely apple muffin for £1.90 from Karaway Bakery stall. If you like great, freshly made bakery items you will not be disappointed.My colleagues rave about the freshly cooked fish and chips from Fish which may be worth a try too.You literally could eat your way around the market dining cheaply and healthy. But visitor beware, it can get very busy around lunch times when the office crowds bustle in. Usually I sit out in the churchyard of Southwark Cathedral or along the Thames overlooking St Paul's.The best produce a great prices. You really are spoilt for choice.||May 31, 2015
VivinKuriakose123||50||If you are a foodie like myself and my wife, head here for the most amazing farm to plate food options. There are options from middle eastern to burgers and even the best seafood paella sold by vendors. Go around lunch time and it's definitely a must visit in London. Very inexpensive. No places to sit. Heard that weekends are even better. There are also lot of farms that sell fresh produce of fruits, olives, fish etc.||May 30, 2015
brooksonline||50||The place was brilliant however very busy! If you want to eat here I'd have a walk around first as a lot of places do the same. Recommend the fresh chocolate brownies! Nice samples too!||May 30, 2015
christine1354||50||A colorful, crowded can't - miss attraction. Enjoy a delicious stand-up breakfast or lunch and bring home some goodies to your rented flat. Among our favorites: vegetarian curry and savory bhujia with onion, pies with meat or veggies and gravy, and light and tasty ciabatta bread. Just check the times; market isn't open every day.||May 30, 2015
Cathy H||50||I will preface my review by saying, markets are our thing. We have done them all over the world, and although this is no Boqueria, it is terrific. We went here on our last day in London and should have gone here first. The market is burdgeoning with food stalls, restaurants, food stuffs to buy, drinks, etc. Don't miss the truffle stall. I was so busy soaking in the atmosphere that I am afraid to say, I did not make mental notes of the particular stalls that I purchased different nibbles from. There was one lady that had pitchers of Sangria for 3 euro a glass, close to the front of the market, and I will say, I highly recommend a cup of her red sangria while browsing the market. There was another stall toward the center, right next to the interesting sign about rents, that sold different kinds of burgers. We had the lamb/mint burger, which I am afraid I cannot recommend. The burger was dry and small and so was the bun. The man did give us a sample of his "salted beef", which in the US we call corned beef, and that was very good. There was an attached green market that had beautiful produce and toward the back several interesting restaurants that we didn't find, unfortunately, until we were already full. The underground has a stop right there so it is very convenient. We had walked over from something else, so when we were ready to go back on the underground I asked the information fellow which way to the underground, he came around his desk and walked us to the stop. He really could have pointed, it was that close, but I thought it was cute. This market has something for every foodie, I highly recommend it.||May 30, 2015
ElGrumpo||40||On a clear day do the Shard then enjoy this querky market. Although don't expect any bargins just interesting varied foods.||May 29, 2015
Sarah W||50||We visited Borough Market on a Friday and were able to take advantage of the full market. There are so many options for food, so if you're interested in something specific or want to visit a particular vendor, make sure you check out their website before your visit. This is on my must-see list for London! Part of the experience is walking around the market and visiting the different vendors. You can buy a large meal or eat small portions from many stalls. If you see something you want, make sure to stop! We walked by a vendor selling prawn wraps and had to stop - so happy we did because it was some of the best food we had that week! I would definitely recommend the market to my friends/family!||May 29, 2015
265keving||50||when you go to London make sure you don't miss this place fantastic ambiance, lively , lots to see and taste the venison burger was fantastic and one of those green smoothies not bad either lots of cheese tasters make sure you try them all. easy to find can be busy over lunch time so if you take little kids maybe go later in the day but overall brilliant day out||May 29, 2015
DanLuvs2Travel||40||We spent the morning and early afternoon at the Tower of London during our April 2015 visit to London. It was about a 20 minute walk to Borough Market, across London Bridge on the south bank. We arrived around 4:00PM and there was lots of activity. It was a Thursday, so the "full market" was open until 5:00PM. (Check the Borough Market website for days and hours when they are open. Everything is not open every day.) We went because we had heard about the great food being served by various vendors. Specifically, we were looking for raclettes at the stand operated by Kappacasein Dairy. These are a serving of new potatoes smothered in Ogleshield cheese, topped with spicy gerkins and pearl onions. Cost was £6.00. Decadent and delicious. We wandered around and also bought a great grilled bratwurst (£4.50) from the German Deli. We finished with dessert from tables operated by Artisan Foods....a piece of German cheesecake and a piece of hazelnut carrot cake. Both were delicious (but the hazelnut carrot cake was better)! As they were shutting down for the day, and packing away all their baked goods, we got them both at a discounted price of £3.00.Besides all the food booths, there were butchers, bakers, florists and lots other shops & stalls. It's an interesting market to visit....and a great place to stop for a delicious bite to eat.||May 29, 2015
webbsgoflorida||50||Very busy, loads of atmosphere...go hungry!Lots of different foods to try, very easy to get to by public transport.||May 29, 2015
Andrew A||40||Once am wholesale market, the canopied Bourough Market (adjacent to Tower Bridge Underground station) provcides an astonishing array of grocery stands and is well worth a visit. There are also seveal interesting places to eat. Don't miss the Bubble and Squeak at Maria's -- an intitution..||May 29, 2015
Laksa6||50||It is good experience to visit this Market as you get to try different types of street food and you are able to buy fresh produce like fruits and vegetables. Cheese and Wines from Europe can also be found here. The atmosphere is almost carnival-like and vibrant. It is not difficult to get to the Market via Tube - a 10-minute walk from the London Bridge Tube Station. Grab a bite and a coffee from the iconic Monmouth Coffee Company where you see people in queues. Note: do not take your breakfast before coming to the market - there are plenty to eat and sample here, from paella to pastries. ||May 28, 2015
FionaMKent||40||Can't believe I've never visited here before!! Bustling market with great friendly stall holders selling some really original products. We started nibbling our way around the stalls sampling the produce.. Then stopped for some fresh juice and finally purchased some lunch and sat in the grounds of the cathedral eating and basking in the sunshine.So many flavours and a great atmosphere. Highly recommend a visit to any foodies||May 28, 2015
Vickie S||40||Going thru the Borough Market was a fun little lunchtime adventure. Tons and tons of different stands with food from all over the world. I grabbed a smoothie and started walking past each stand to check out all the different kinds of food. While i was trying to figure out what i wanted for lunch, i got pretty full on just the samples that were offered from each vendor. My memory is a little hazy as its been about 8 months since I was actually in London, but I wanted to give it a TA review anyway! In a nutshell, friendly vendors, lots of samples (cheeses, breads, meats, dips, olives, veggies, fruits, the list goes on and on), delicious foods, an overall fun experience! After stuffing myself with samples, i finally bought some curry chicken and rice that was being cooked right in front of everyone in a giant cauldron. It was a massive portion that i didn't finish, reasonably priced, and quite yummy! If you have some time to wander thru here to hunt for some good food definitely stop by!||May 28, 2015
GaddisGadabout||50||The Saturday crowds at Borough Market can get to where you can do little but shuffle along like penguins but it is easy to understand the draw for this legendary culinary madhouse. The individual purveyors of cheeses, meats, fishes etc are cheek by jowl with all manner of stands offering fresh-made, fresh-grilled food. But before trying anything else, you must join the queue for one of Kappacasein's famous 3-cheese toasties. (6 pounds in May 2015). Arguably, this is the finest single item in London. I am serious.||May 27, 2015
HeatherR889||40||Went for a look round on a Saturday morning, and be warned... It's manic...lots of food stalls especially cheese and vegetables. Lots of stalls with food to eat on the hoof. Amazing range of different stalls from truffle pate' to wine and tropical fruit and vegetables. Clever sitting area for when you need to rest your feet, but you might have to wait for a space. Samples to try before you buy. Well worth a visit. Right next to Southwark Cathedral if you need a quite sit down and only a few minutes walk from the river.||May 27, 2015
stanners1978||40||You can't go wrong at borough market. If you can eat it, it's sold here. From fresh meat and vegetables to more exotic jamaican and turkish treats you'll definatelly have lots to smell, see and taste. ||May 27, 2015
ErrigalLodge||50||Come and try - free taster! That's the cry from many stalls selling cooked samples of their meat, game, fish and shellfish though not so much hot food for veggies to eat there but then there are excellent greengrocers selling fabulous fresh and cheap vegetables, fruits to take home. Cheeses to die for and loads of fresh mushrooms make sure any vegetarians will not be disappointed. Finally. Oysters and champagne at 8am - what's not to like?||May 27, 2015
MilwaukeeHawkeye01||50||Visited the market on a weekday afternoon during a recent visit to London. My only problem with the market is it was impossible to decide what to eat! Even as a vegetarian the options were endless. I opted for the Ethiopian. It did not disappoint.||May 27, 2015
Filipa C||50||Beautiful food market, with plenty of choice. It's possible to find everything at Borough market. Easily accessible by bus or tube. Location is also great, near the river.||May 27, 2015
efuss||50||The smells, the sites, the tastes, I thoroughly enjoyed this market. It is a true farmer's market with everything from cured meats, fresh produce, fresh seafood, excellent cheeses, olives, baked goods, spices, you name it. If you don't like crowds, this place isn't for you. However, if you like to shop for a little bit of everything in food, this is the place.||May 26, 2015
bodiciousblighter||50||Take a walk in the spring or summer along the southbank from Westminster Bridge past the NT, visit the book market to Borough Market for a food fest and produce market that is unparalleled anywhere in London. The views are great and the atmosphere unrivalled.||May 26, 2015
SierraMaydell||50||We were warned there wouldn't be much going on in the afternoon as it is considered a "morning market" but to be honest I thought it was amazing. We got there at about 3 in the afternoon and all of the stalls were still open and giving out yummy samples. We walked out with some of the best cheese and bread which only made it to the church next to the market for a little impromptu picnic followed by delicious goat ice-cream. It was a really great experience and everyone was so friendly. I look forward to visiting again next time I am in London.||May 26, 2015
Readster56||50||If you like fresh and interesting food, try the borough Market.The first of the season cherries were so fresh, pies, meats, bread for every taste/.A must visit venue.||May 26, 2015
Bea_K186223||50||Visited on a Saturday morning and found the whole experience to be exciting and enjoyable. It is very busy and crowded but you can still take time to sample loads of exotic foods and to take in the whole atmosphere. When I visit again I will take a large shopping bag and make the market my only London stop. It isn't really practical to cart stuff around the capital! There is a wealth of food to be eaten at the market and plenty of meat, cheese, veg etc etc to buy to take home.A great place to visit and so much to see and try.||May 26, 2015
Leo C||30||I went on a Thursday afternoon at around 2pm, so not too packed, but lots of people. Food was fantastic, overpriced, but fantastic, but there didn't seem to be that many stalls there with differing variaty||May 26, 2015
ElleBelle250||50||It's packed, but it's worth it. Went there with family. The atmosphere is family oriented. Food is delicious. The duck sandwich is to die for. ||May 25, 2015
otp71||50||Visited at lunchtime, a great variety of excellent bites and foodstuffs to eat on the spot or take away. The atmosphere and selection were excellent, and the location is very beautiful in its own special way. Will definitely visit again when in London!||May 25, 2015
sltravel2015||50||Fresh produce at its best! Everything from meat, fish, bread, cheese, jams, well the list is endless. Also great food stalls where you get a delicious lunch. Anything you want you may find here!||May 25, 2015
verbijsterd||50||This is such a great place to go to for food. They have everything. Take whatever you want and have breakfast or lunch outside. Monmouth is just around the corner for coffee, but tends to get crowded. Good (better?) coffee alternative is the Notes Coffee market stall.||May 25, 2015
UrbanNomad11||40||To do justice to this market one has to go with a good appetite.Awesome array of food to satiate even the most fussy.One can spend a whole afternoon and go back the next day!!A visit to bread ahead is a must||May 24, 2015
RemcoV533||50||When arriving at market you feel the vibe. Stands with quality products as meat, vegetables, fish, land products,etc. Shops and restaurants with tasty bites and matching drinks. Borough Market is the other London you need to see. ||May 24, 2015
SarahDntn||40||I like the variety of food stalls. I visit it sometimes at lunch time and, as a treat, I also buy fruits, vegetables, meats and olives, but it's rare, because it's very expensive. Definitely a place to check out!||May 24, 2015
Val M||50||Lots of atmosphere - visited three times in three days - just wish I could visit every day - so much choice and the freshness of the produce available was amazing. ||May 24, 2015
JamesBischoff||50|| My family and I all visit the market fairly regularly. There are few places in the world where one can find such a range of 'artisan' foods and drinks, the quality is excellent but the price is high. Worth visiting early as it fills up with tourists and by mid-day it is tricky to move around. Wonderfully range of cheese, olives, fruit, vegetables, breads and really delicious fish, etc.||May 24, 2015
BATTIKHI78||30||If you wanted to take a break from all the history ...the shopping ....and the craziness that is happening in london....this place is a good choice...lots of people...lots of things on display.. Your nose will have a million different smell...be prepared||May 23, 2015
neilalexander||50||great range of veg, fruit, meat, olive and virgin oils, teas and coffees and bakeries - all of the highest quality||May 23, 2015
Pierre171||50||Borough Market is one of the best open food markets in the UK and arguably in Europe. Though with a different feel that one in France, it offers a great vibe and a very good selection of all things food. Good meat, vegetables and cheese selections as well as an array of local and ethnic products.||May 23, 2015
Nora Erika V||50||Fairytale comes true :)) a lovely market where you can buy all the gourmet ingredients you can imagine: fruits, vegetables, fresh seafood and so on||May 22, 2015
lenas734||30||A rather big food market, but there isn't much to choose from: cheese, meat, fish, bread and fruit. I've seen bigger and more impressive food markets (i.e. Boqueria in Barcelona), but this one is totally worth seeing||May 22, 2015
Welda M||50||Great variety of food and drink stalls, fresh, organic, foods from all over the world! Wonderful stop to grab a drink with friends. The place is buzzing after five when Londoners meet up after work for drinks. Vibrant fresh food market! Worth a visit!||May 22, 2015
Volle1953||50||Borough Market is a place you must experience.Are you interested in good food and wine, you will feel good in this market.There are many stands where they sell street food of the best quality.||May 21, 2015
CCBOSS||50||A great place to get fresh foods of all types and enjoy lunch and a drink. Gets busy at weekends but brilliant during the week.||May 20, 2015
LindaRoo||40||Fun place to walk around and try some of foods London has to offer. I had the chorizo sausage sandwich at Brindisa and the grilled cheese sandwich at Kappacasein on two different days. Both were very tasty. It gets very crowded there, so I recommend that you come on Thursday or Friday instead of Saturday.||May 20, 2015
56anney||50||I love this place. If you want to have good streetfood there's a plenty of places to choose, from different cultures. Food is good quality and atmosphere very outgoing. Also lot of amazing products from small producers. ||May 20, 2015
Sophie7292||50||We went on a Saturday lunchtime so inevitably it was hugely crowded. Despite that, there was an amazing atmosphere and huge selection of fresh food and cuisines on offer to cater for any dietary requirement, both for eating there and to take away for home preparation.||May 20, 2015
jmb222||50||One of my favorite stops on the whole trip! It's near the Shakespeare Globe and the food is absolutely out of this world! You simply must go and plan on getting your lunch there. So many options and choices! All so fresh!||May 20, 2015
BAJ89||50||Borough Market is a brilliant food market with a vast range of produce fresh seafood, chesses, wines, cider, paella, curries, brilliant pastries and so much more. The market is full wonderful aroma's of lovely cooked food and is pulsing with noises ,energy and activityThe market is right opposite London Bridge underground station; and just a short stroll away from the Globe theatre, the Millennium bridge and Southwark Cathedral so easy to combine different visits in the same day.A couple of tips - Late in the day many vendors will discount some items. Ensure you go to the market hungry.||May 20, 2015
Dariya K||50||It is a great pleasure to visit Borough Market even if you don't want to buy anything. I can spend hours just going around, looking at the people and sellers. It is also great place to have something for lunch& I can strongly recommend you 'Pieminister": best pies I've ever had! ||May 20, 2015
Sscady||40||Definitely a feast for the eyes, much less for your pockets. Nonetheless it is an exciting experience to walk along the corridors underneath the railway vaults. You will find stalls with cured meat, an incredible selection of local cheeses (and you'll discover that Cheddar is not the only British option), locally grown fruit and vegetables, fresh meat from local farms, home made bread, pastries and cakes different spreads and dips, oil and so on. Cured meat and cheese from Italy and France and Spain. Furthermore a number of dedicated stalls will provide you with "ready to eat" solutions. I fondly remember the "duck sandwich + 1 glass of red wine" deal for 5 pounds. I would highly recommend a visit but avoid lunchtime on Saturday (the full market is on also on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays). ||May 20, 2015
Neil B||30||Having visited the market in the day time along with many other people, it can became very over crowded, took a stoll around when the market closed, a completly diffrent feel to the area, its safe, plenty of places open to eat & drink||May 20, 2015
Jan R||40||Lots of fabulous food stalls in the shadow of Sothwark Cathedral. All sorts of specialist products and free samples. Getting a bit expensive but veg stalls still cheap and cheerful. Historic pubs like The George nearby. Market open Friday's and Saturdays.||May 20, 2015
nicisdisturbed||40||Maybe I went at the wrong time, and I'm a guy who likes a busy market but I had no opportunity to slow down and view all the amazing foods on offer. I'll definitely re-visit but not at peak times!||May 20, 2015
PDvfx||50||Although Borough Market can be a bit touristy, it still remains as a great food market. With all the facility upgrades, Borough is now an even better place to grab lunch, and sit by the Thames.||May 20, 2015
Rutu79||50||I LOVE Borough Market, so much to see and EAT! from fresh foods: veg, fruit, meats, freshly caught fish to a huge variety of hot meals and of course cakes mmmm. What makes Borough Market even more interesting is the location!||May 19, 2015
Ermoo||50||Never been before but what a vibrant kicking place, full of delicious smells and lots of noises. Will visit again but earlier as arrived when stalls were packing up||May 19, 2015
AnnH626||40||Either the market or cathedral as a breakfast starting point for a wander up or down the Thames - favourite walk is towards Waterloo for lunch at the Southbank. Would take any first visitor to !ondon on this route to see the best London offers.||May 19, 2015
515Donna||50||Great market, really busy and buzzy and great to buy something then sit in the courtyard of Southwark Cathedral to eat it. It more than just a trip to a market, it can be a whole day. brilliant after to stroll along the South Bank or the back streets of Bermondsey and imagine olde London. There is also the Shard opposite.||May 19, 2015
Moley1230||50||Save your appetite for this market, the food on offer is amazing. I had a vegetarian meal (indian) and it was fab. Was tempted to stuff myself with more!. Worth wandering around just to people watch too.||May 19, 2015
joshuapaul73||40||I often trek to Borough market. And despite the changes over the years and ongoing works overhead at London Bridge station, it's not lost its charm and eclectic mix of food and market stalls. If you visiting London, then head hear for a good choice of food and enjoy the hustle and bustle. ||May 19, 2015
JOZO1307||50||Come rain or shine this excellent market near London Bridge is well worth a visit. Specialist stalls with vendors who really know and love their ware. Good place to graze as you wander in and out of this old venue. Close by are locations of Happy Potter filmings and other films. Authentic, characterful and easy to get to. Incoroprate in you rvisit to other attractions like Southwark catherdal. Check out old local pubs and warehouses for old London||May 19, 2015
Judy H||50||Brilliant but be ready for the crowds. Artisan food on all the stalls and lovely coffee shops and pub. Then follow up with a walk along the embankment.||May 19, 2015
Kim-Neil||40||Great selection of food stalls but too crowded at the weekend which makes it uncomfortable unless you like crowds ||May 19, 2015
Adam M||40||Great market for getting food to eat while purchasing more take away food and unusual tasty nibbles.||May 19, 2015
Chris L||50||Took the family there for a fabulous excursion. The boys loved all the stalls, and the samples they were given by everyone. We biought many good things to take home, and had lunch at a delicious Turkish cafe. Wonderful foody experience.||May 19, 2015
barkingiguana||40||I love shopping here, you can get all of the most beautiful ingredients. It's usually incredibly busy though as it's a massive tourist destination as well as being a huge draw to the local foodies. Don't let that put you off, just expect to be jostled a bit and don't suddenly stop walking to take pictures or someone will walk in to the back of you!There are two great coffee shops here, and lots of places to grab lunch - try the free range scotch eggs at Scotchtails, yum!||May 19, 2015
KimmyUK2013||50||Great atmosphere walking around the market. Go hungry as there are fantastic p,aces go eat and drink. Varied foods available. If you go on a Sunday, pop your head into Southwark cathedral||May 19, 2015
philipotti||50||Do you want to just pick at food, stroll about and enjoy the surroundings? This is the place for you! From food to drinks, you'll love it all!||May 19, 2015
debbiecole||50||Really worth a visit for the sites sounds and smells. What a wonderful place to just wonder around and pick up unusual foody things. The colours in the fruit and veg are a site not to be missed as are all the seafood stalls. Really worht a visit||May 19, 2015
Merisi1610||50||Walking around the market the produce AND the people there offer a colourful environment - the stalls are all world-class, eats on the hoof, game, pies, fish, special sauces and so on, and the drink is great also! Great stuff||May 19, 2015
Sharon L||50||I loved everything about it, the variety of international food stands, the energy, the produce market, the ability to purchase small food items to take home.||May 19, 2015
Indotraveller_10||50||Be prepared to arrive with food sensory overload!Make sure you arrive hungry as there is a bit of everything for everyone.Whiskey ginger does amazing food and drinks, Boston sausages, Thai, goat cheese ice cream, baguettes, coffee, beer, everything is here.Limited park space so grab a sidewalk to munch down on the yummy snacks here||May 18, 2015
Selinawongg||40||Went to Borough Market for the first time. Right opposite the London Bridge underground, meaning location was very convenient. It is semi covered, so still quite good even when it rains. Huge selection of food to eat and to go. Must try the fresh wild oysters when you're there, worth the queue ! A must see when in London.||May 18, 2015
Alyssa B||40||This is a cool market. It's mostly cheese and meats. Except for one end does have fruits and veggies. Just depends on what your looking for.||May 18, 2015
Karyn19||50||Wow ,we spent a short time looking round before going to the whiskey shopWhat treats you could see and all the lovely foods being cooked smelt and tasted wonderful.||May 18, 2015
Charlotte4w||50||Amazing market, great stalls and great food. Walking distance from the Shard. Would recommend not eating before you get there - to many choices for great food when you get there.||May 18, 2015
TheTravellingFamily||40||First time visit with my sister and it didn't disappoint us at all! The food was excellent, many nice stalls and even the organic fruit sold have a good price! Also try the patties, really nice. Went here on a rainy Thursday and it wasn't too busy so we got to see most of it. Will definitely return on one of my future visits to London.||May 17, 2015
jlg3000||50||This market makes for a wonderful visit, you'll probably spend an hour or two browsing the stalls. You'll see great displays of vegetables, meats, cheeses, breads, baked goods, seafood, etc.||May 17, 2015
lilredwriter||50||If you're into food, Borough Market is a must. Lots of amazing sights and smells and friendly vendors. Don't miss the oyster stand. They'll shuck 'em for you right there on the spot. I can't wait to go back!||May 17, 2015
Dani_Zaupa||50||I simply Love this Market. Arrive in the morning on a given Saturday and prepare to try food from all over the world. And still be able to bring home some ingredients for a perfect meal. ||May 16, 2015
MelZell88||50||We happened upon this area at a very opportune time. We were VERY hungry. This has lots of local meats and cheeses and breads and produce and other local wares. Recommended for a trip through around lunch time!||May 16, 2015
Mishy B||50||Saw all the sights and sounds whilst visiting London but did not expect this place to be up there as being the coolest. I basically had a bite and sip from almost every stall. Great cookies, iced tea, Chicken kebab hmm all good. Also took home some packaged food items and beers which is great if you want to take something different home to enjoy for later.||May 16, 2015
HI_Traveller_12||50||Incredible! So many food vendors from so many cultures. All the food was prepared fresh and reasonably priced. I loved the many pastries, roast pork sandwich with crackle, salt beef sandwich, cheeses and so much more. We combined it with a trip to the globe theater and a walk over the Millennium bridge . Bring a big appetite and cash (they don't take credit cards ).||May 16, 2015
Sandy K||50||A Foodies paradise located next to the Thames river. We walked to this market up after seeing the Crown Jewels at the London Tower. It was Wednesday afternoon which is less crowded- Saturday being the busiest.What you'll find here - organic veggies, fresh seafood, Chesses, wines, baked items, fresh olives, awesome meat pies, paella, meat delis, dried fruits & nuts and much more....This was the best outdoor market I've ever visited and a must see while in London. Tip - Get here later in the day and many vendors will discount items. We hit up the Essex oyster vendor, Fish & chips vendor, meat pie vendor and of course the baked goods vendor. Quality was great and there's no charge for admission.||May 16, 2015
richardsmyname||50||We went through the market really quick -- probably a little too quickly -- so my suggestion is to make a bit of time for it. Grab a bite in the market, and explore the food stalls!||May 16, 2015
AmyA124||40||We went on a Saturday and it was very busy. Managed to see a few nice food stalls and had a delicious pork burger from Hobbs.||May 15, 2015
Tina W||50||Love this place! Come hungry and snack your way through. Great for breakfast, lunch and snacks. Great foods to take home too. I love it!||May 15, 2015
medsp3c||40||A large market with a wide range of food offerings as well as fresh and preserved produce! We easily spent a couple of hours going from stall to stall to see what was interesting to us!||May 15, 2015
Railwayman35||50||Saturday afternoons, Brilliant, so many different types of food from oysters and champagne to a good old kebab, there are so many good quality food retailers here you will be spoilt for choice. Located with a number of good public houses in the adjacent street this is a place that, despite numerous visits I never tire of visiting.||May 14, 2015
Korkhun||50||The market is not too big. There is indoor and outdoor area. Lots of shop especially cheese and bakery. Don't forget to try Spanish fried rice and some eastern food- attached to London bridge station and London bridge||May 14, 2015
TamuMomx2||50||We had a fun lunch at Borough Market. We went on Tuesday and it was not too crowded. My daughter went on a weekend and said it was crazy crowded. We had great food and enjoyed seeing all the offerings. Borough Market has been going for over 1000 years. Amazing!||May 13, 2015
RobbieSS||50||First rate open air food market with fresh foods of all types. Come early for breakfast! Easy to get to from the London Bridge tube stop. Just exit stop and walk toward the church. Stop by Roast to go, and Tea2You. Grab a chunk of cheese for your hotel snaking at Neal's Yard Dairy. This place is a reason to visit London, not just a site to see.||May 13, 2015
xraymike85||50||The food here is so fresh and so delicious, avoid coming here during peak times, always open and the quality is always the same!||May 12, 2015
aries138||50||Borough market is officially my favourite place in London and my personal heaven on earth. I've never seen so many different cultures gathered harmoniously (and deliciously) in one single area before. You can buy and try food literally from all around the world and be fascinated by all these flavours and aromas that come from every single stand. I was extremely amazed by the Greek olive oil, the handmade Italian pasta and the Ethiopian street food. The best day to visit is of course Saturday in terms of variety, but it is advisable to go as early as possible because it gets really crowded in the afternoon. In case you decide to go on a weekday you really need to check online for the timetable, as there are days that the market half-opened. Nevertheless, it is definitely a place that international cuisines meet and form a really joyful atmosphere and it surely worth one (at least) visit.||May 12, 2015
NormaT||50||What an amazing place - beautiful well set out stalls which range from fish , shell fish, cheese, vegetables, cakes, drinks etc etcWish we had any thing like it in the North East !We visited early in the morning - about 10am and it was easy to look around - go later and it is very busy. ||May 12, 2015
Jimmyw88||50||What an enthralling experience, the whole place is completely captivating. So many different smells, sights and tastes. Being able to nibble and taste as you browse the vendors was great. So I bought a jar of scotch bonnet chilli jam from Pimento Hill after having a little sample and being blown away, we then stopped for fresh oysters, which were succulent and tasty. After browsing all the vendors we decided to opt for Gourmet Goat and OH! did it deliver, if you are ever in the area i would recommend checking these guys out, they know how to cook goat. Finally as we were leaving our eyes were drawn to doughnuts at Bread Ahead, too much filling to handle, in a good way.||May 12, 2015
Tyero||50||Borough Market is any food fan's dream. A large crowd but so so so many food vendors, there is something for everyone here. A lot of cheap food as well for those on a budget. I sampled an insane amount of food and everything was good. Meats, cheeses, noodles, pastas, burgers, seafood, etc. One of the top food destinations in the world.||May 11, 2015
MattE217||40||This market has apparently operated for a long time and has a great tradition attached to it. Check out the cheese shops which are amazing. There are some dedicated French and Swiss cheese shops with incredible varieties of cheese. Whilst you are there, check out the Southwark Cathedral which is right next door. Shakespeare lived in this area for part of his life and this is highlighted in part of the cathedral||May 11, 2015
Vic P||50||If you have the slightest interest in food you cannot visit London without visiting Borough Market. Street food, stalls, fresh meat, fish, vegetables, cheeses ... well everything you can imagine really. A veritable cornucopia of world food.Surrounded by some great eating places and wine bars if you want to sit down.Great buzzy atmosphere which is totally different by day or night.||May 11, 2015
hotchef1967||40||Great market to wander around sampling great, tasty bites and drinks.Venture from stall to stall – take in a salt beef sandwich, a cheese cone or something more exotic. Top off with a drink, available from the copious places to choose from.Browse around and take home delectable delights to prepare yourself.GREAT!||May 11, 2015
Maureen B||50||This is a must! Everywhere you look there's food and more food! Breads, cheeses, sweets, and more! It was so much fun to look at everything- then go back thru and pick out what I wanted!||May 10, 2015
gardinem8||40||Great range of food on offer interspersed with sit down coffee shops and restaurants...great atmosphere......but go early if you don't like crowds||May 9, 2015
Marlene D||50||What a delightful place to stop and see the glorious fruits, vegetables, flowers, various produce and products from locals. Vibrant and a dance of movement and sensual treats. Great place to stop for a bite or a beer in the afternoon. The atmosphere is festive and purposeful. I found the most wonderful balsamic vinegar and cheeses here, great bread and cold cuts for a quick picnic. Right on the Thames, a lovely walk from the Tate Modern.||May 9, 2015
cgiderler||50||Definitely the best food market in London. Cheeses,breads,mushrooms,olives,sausages and much more. While walking in front the food benchs you feel hungry. You can choose many options. You can find many cousins all around the world for a reasonable price. We tried burger,calamari and paella. Prices are below London's turistical side's average. You must go in crowds and feast your self:)||May 9, 2015
drpadron||40||I haven't seen so much variety in food and delicacies from all over the world. Also many samples to try. Not as expensive for London standards. The roof and stands are charming, I liked it not only for the food but because of the decoration, roof, the cleanliness and the uniformity in the decoration of all the different stands. Almost os nice as La Boqueria in Barcelona, Mercado San Miguel de Madrid. Also worth visiting the Markthal in Rotterdam.||May 9, 2015
WJT101||40||Borough Market is a delightful assault on the senses and a foodies dream. Only the food halls in Harrods compare but they certainly don't offer the value for money that Borough Market does. We went early on a Saturday had a delicious breakfast and did the weeks food shopping. It gets very busy after about 1030 so go early or be ready for the crowds. ||May 8, 2015
j b||40||We enjoyed our visit to Borough Market,we went about 2.30pm so it wasn't as busy. we were able to chat to the stallholders & try some of the cheesses before buying.We purchased some Lord London,very light, tasty, creamy cheese, amongst others.Its a fun,busy place with a good variety of foods and some good shops surrounding the market. Not far from The Thames so easy to get to. .||May 7, 2015
Jeremy C||50||This is a great place to visit if you like food. There is everything on offer for the foody from all around the globe and plenty of opportunities to try samples.||May 7, 2015
Mary Kate P||50||I'm am American studying abroad in London and I've been here so far for six months and I highly highly recommend visiting Borough Market for every age range and price range! The street food is about as cheap as you could possibly buy something in London for (think 5-7 pounds for a filling meal), so it's great if you're on a budget, but it's also delicious, fresh, cleanly and good quality! Hopping and lively during the day, be sure to check the hours you go but the best days and times to visit are morning/ lunch time on Friday and Saturdays, this is when the full market is open. Sundays unfortunately the market is closed so save something else (like Camden Lock Market) for a Sunday trip if you're in London for a weekend or week. The market also offers great desserts and other specialities, like beautiful cheeses, breads, cured meats, oysters, fresh fish, and fresh fruits and vegetables. LOVE! Options for everyone's preferences and requirements, as a vegetarian I have had tons of options but so have my meat-eating friends, also includes several gluten-free stands :)||May 7, 2015
Jason S||50||Great to go and visit in the heart of London.Amazing food options if you love a wide variety of foods.I went a couple of times to experience the atmosphere and the great options for food.It's not just food other merchandise is available at reasonable prices.Very much worth a visit, maybe go at lunchtime, your stomach will thank you.||May 7, 2015
feedme247||40||My boyfriend took me to Borough Market when we went to visit London cause we both love our food. I had never heard of this market prior to visiting. It was a buzzing market full of little stalls to suit every taste. It is very easy to spend a day here trying bits and pieces from every stall. Will deffo visit again!||May 6, 2015
MdmVerdier87||40||We decided to stop here and hopefully find something good for a low-key lunch. There is so much to choose from! The smell from all the stands is just amazing and there are free samples everywhere. My hubby tried Scotch eggs, while I had an Ethiopian chicken wrap. Add a fruit smoothie and Indian sweets for dessert and you have a nice international mix!||May 6, 2015
jeff g||50||You could probably eat here every day for a month and not run out of options. We visited twice during the seven days we were in London. Will definitely return next time we are in town. Standout item this trip was the Chorrizo sandwich.||May 6, 2015
trevorgrehan||40||My wife and I spent an hour in the market. We should have planned to eat and drink there. There is some lovely food available and some drink. Fantastic smells from all the cooking. We would go again. Trevor Grehan Ireland||May 6, 2015
Flasheart78||20||My wife and i visited Borough Market on a Saturday afternoon. Fantastic sights and smells but thats where the fun ended for me. Its was so packed that it was annoying and uncomfortable and everything is at London tourist prices so wont be going back in a hurry.||May 6, 2015
frances a||40||Its a good free attraction and there's lots to see but it is busy on a Saturday. You can get unusual things and takeaway food is reasonable||May 6, 2015
home644||40||Stumbled apon this market by accident.. whilst trying to locate the Shard... ( yeah I know... hard to loose the Shard) So pleased we found it... I've been back twice. Amazing diverse choice of foods. Definitely recommend a visit||May 6, 2015
isayade||40||I really recommand to visit this market, plenty of life, nice foods you can taste ( spices, cheeses, olive oil, breads...). A nice spot you can buy your meal for lunch. We found a nice and tasty lebanon booth, yummy!||May 5, 2015
floridaskiers||40||So much food/fun/crafts and you name it to see and sample and buy but on a nice Saturday afternoon - don't go near this place!! You can barely move but during the week - a gem!!!||May 5, 2015
Chris B||50||I do agree with other reviewers that Saturday is best avoided as it gets stupidly busy. But if you're a food love living in London, this place is a must. Ginger Pig and Brindisa are especially reccommended.||May 5, 2015
Fred C||40||Tip one - don't go to Borough Market on a Saturday if you are at all bad in crowds. It is busy. No, it is packed. Go early or go another day. Try to avoid lunchtime - although that rather spoils the point of going! But if you are OK with crowds, happy to be dragged hither and yon with the flow, you'll be fine.Tip two - take lots of cash. Get it out of the ATM BEFORE you get there. The local ATMs will have a queue a mile long with people who didn't bring enough and have spent what they did.Tip three - don't buy the first thing you see. Wander around. The variety is tremendous. You will see fresh fruit, vegetables, mushrooms, fish you've only read about in cookery books or seen on fine dining TV programmes. Razor clams, samphire, chanterelles, they were all there last visit.Tip four - take a big shopping bag or a rucksack. You will buy a lot. You will spend all your money. Despite tip 2, you WILL be queuing at the ATM.You will love it - it's brilliant. I have seen the surrounding area revived by the success of the market. Buy a traditional pork pie - or have oysters and a glass of white wine. Buy some fantastic finochiona salami. Just enjoy.So why not 5 stars? I guess because it is a victim of its own success, it's too crowded, and it's too expensive. But what the hell - if you like food, you'll love it.||May 4, 2015
CindyJstc||50||Don't miss this incredible food market! Everything we tried was delicious! Different ethnic foods, teas, coffee, spices and desserts! Grilled Cheese was The Best! Make sure you go hungry and try as much as you can. Bring a jacket as it tends to be a bit windy in that area.||May 4, 2015
Mix-m8||50||Fabulous place to wander through and kill timeThe trouble is it is so interesting you needs loads of timeThe range of foods on show are amazing and the taste and smells are tantalising Great place to visit ||May 4, 2015
Nan F||50||I ate here five times in six days, sampling Ethiopian, Turkish, Cajun, and Spanish foods, along with Bread Ahead donuts. Yum yum! Eating is only part of the fun, mingling and chatting with vendors is tops, and I picked up tons of tasty treats for friends back home, including tortillas, hot sauce, spices, and herbs. Tea towels for the ladies, organic teas from Ceylon and a nice bain marie for my son at Borough Kitchen. Enjoyed a jazz trio playing at lunchtime, and knocked back a green juice, bagged organic fruits for munching on a walk to the Tate. Splendid place, and just within view of the outrageous, glorious Shard!||May 4, 2015

Amanda503775||50||Really enjoyed looking around the stalls picking out food for a picnic along the Thames. Beautiful olives, cured meat, bread and olives. To finish off best strawberries.||May 4, 2015
BirchyCat||40||Go on a Friday and avoid lunchtime. Plenty of places to eat & drink nearby. Loads to sample and takeaway in the market itself. Some of the stuff is pricey. Great if you want something out of the ordinary. Lots of artisan breads. A mix of tourists, hipsters and local office workers all enjoying the hot food on offer. ||May 3, 2015
Teresa M||50||We saw this market given a rave review on a holiday show at home so we gave it a try. It is everything a market should be-fresh produce, great atmosphere, things to see & diverse lunch options. My husband ate at "Pie Minister" & had the works affectionately referred to as "The Mother Ship" which included your choice of pie, mushy peas, gravy, grilled onions, creamy mash which was eaten with delight! Being a vego I had several options and enjoyed the haloumi and carrot burger in a wholemeal bun from the place next door which was equally yummy!||May 3, 2015
djhallett||40||This market is a must for "Foodies".Great place to stroll around and sample the different cuisines.One criticism is there is very little seating to sit and eat.You have to buy your food and walk around with it.Not the best experience!||May 3, 2015
mummam4||50||Heard of this Market, visited 1st May (not planned) could have stayed for hours! Food and shopping absolutely amazing, tasting available too. An absolute gem, more than worth a visit.||May 2, 2015
arizonavoyager||50||If you want to go where the chefs go to get the best of all ingredients, Borough Market is your destination. There are some full time venues, but the majority of the most colorful stalls are only open Wednesday through Saturday and Saturday is definitely the main event. The market is jammed. Locals go to hit their favorite stalls for the week's marketing. Tourists wander around delightedly sipping Prosecco, Pims, coffee, or fresh organic juices; nibbling on enticing samples from the vendors; and noshing down an exotic meal or typical British lunch from a take away container while perching on a wall in the Southwark Cathedral churchyard, or just leaning against a pillar or sitting on the curb. It's shoulder-to-shoulder and the pedestrian traffic jam is exacerbated by all the photo taking and general consternation as people try to figure out how to navigate the labyrinth of pathways between the stalls. It is absolutely all great fun and great food and great atmosphere, but you must have patience for crowds (well mannered and multinational). There's no better way to spend a Saturday morning/early afternoon in London. You will really feel you are part of the city! If you want to avoid the crowds, go late Friday afternoon and you will have a much more leisurely experience and you can appreciate the atmosphere and architecture of one of the oldest markets in London. Or visit both Friday and Saturday and see both sides!||May 2, 2015
David M||50||Borough market is crammed full of food stalls, some just fruit and vegetables, others specialist meats and cheeses. Increasingly, over the years, stalls with interesting food to eat for brunch and/or lunch. We go there almost every time we go into London on a weekend from our home in Cambridge. THE place to go for coffee is Monmouth Coffee Company: long queues but worth it - unless you like Starbucks, in which case you can probably find one of those every 100 yards on every street in London!||May 2, 2015
Ripi14||40||I just came back from a week in London and me and some friends went to the market on one of its maybe crowed days (Saturday). We went there to get some lunch, I we did not regret doing that. You can get almost what ever you want :) I got a kebab at one of the stands, although it had a long line, was if most defiantly worth the wait. One of the best lunches I had on the trip. The price was not to bad considering the place and the freshness of the ingredients. :) You might have to spend a half day there if you want to see it all. And taste all the good food. Definitely worth a visit when ever you are in London. I know that I will go there the next time. ||May 2, 2015
Mark S||40||Borough market has all foods from around the world in 1 area from sweats to ice creams and all types of meals for yr delight. With fruit and veggies on sale it's a perfect place to stock up yr back pack. ||May 1, 2015
Rose F||40||Absolutely love it, variety of foods to eat whilst you walk around or to take home. You can have a glass of bubbly or sangria and take it all in. A real gem of a place to walk around, free entry. I ate my food in the grounds of the church next to it. Felt like Judith charmers walking around tasting samples of curry etc.||May 1, 2015
jacobt117||40||This was the first time I'd visited borough market and found it a thoroughly engaging and interesting food experience. Lots of samples of things you've never tried on offer and if you go there with an open mind your sure to enjoy yourself ||May 1, 2015
bevgPreston_||50||Borough Market drew us back for another visit as it has an atmosphere all of its own. The smells, variety and characters on the stalls make a definite place to visit. Have a taste of the specialities on offer cheeses, pickle, home bread and pies etc.The market is a must see for all visitors, plenty to see and close to other attractions.||May 1, 2015
angiel199||50||I loved visiting here, had lunch at one of the stands and got homemade pasta. Was delicious! Lots of interesting homemade goods, would have bought plenty had I not been travelling home a few days later. Must visit if in the area!!||May 1, 2015
utterlybutters||50||For the uninitiated, this is London's most renowned food market which is a haven for chefs, restaurateurs, passionate amateur cooks and anyone who happens to love eating and drinking.My visit on Tuesday around 4pm meant that quite a few traders had packed up and gone home. This would never happen in Albert Square!Borough has been associated with food markets as far back as the 11th century and nowadays the taste, quality and provenance of produce is regularly measured so think Leeds Market!The choice is incredible; see http://boroughmarket.org.uk/traders where you'll find an interactive map to help track down a particular specialty.I'd never been before and was expecting a tatty street market comprising stalls awash with bric-a-brac or pointless souvenirs. It's not!Close to Southwark Cathedral and The Shard plus plenty of other London Bridge attractions. A must-see.||May 1, 2015
Robsski||40||Great range of stores and lunchtime street food. Cheeses, olives, fishmongers - pretty much whatever you want. Prices can be eye watering though .... Most county towns have butchers etc offering quality at far better prices! ||May 1, 2015
momo0momo||40||Went there on Monday around lunch time, the market itself is not very busy, some of the stalls are closed on Monday. We wanderred around and stumbbled accross this stall at the corner selling grilled scallops with crispy bacon topping...and yes it was mouth watering, the scallops were fresh and full of flavours. Also got some paela from the stall across, it was delicious! Spent about an hour here and took a walk to London Bridge...||April 30, 2015
H2794UFdavidm||40||Was really busy but had a range of stalls selling all sorts and a huge selection of street food vendors from german sausage to Dosa to pie from pieminister.. Well worth a visit when on the south bank ||April 30, 2015
mexicanbound5||40||This is amazing....you want any kind of ethnic food it should be here!! But so was half of London!! you could hardly walk it was so busy! First warm, sunny Saturday of the year and everyone and their dog was out.....literally!!||April 29, 2015
lauralZ4054DG||50||Visited in October last year & returned to show my husband just what he'd missed. Great market atmosphere, quality produce & lots just a bit different! Loads of samples to taste & huge variety of foods to eat or buy to take away!! Last visit was Hoisin Duck wraps, this visit Hog Roast Roll....both excellent!! Only downside was unless going to one of the tabled restaurants then due to how popular the Market is there is few places to sit around & enjoy the atmosphere as the grounds in the church at rear were packed already. But didn't make any difference was still a great afternoon out & worth a repeat visit.||April 29, 2015
Agnes W||50||Honestly, I had dilemmas picking out what to eat because EVERYTHING looked very good, and my stomach had limited capacity. A lot of the vendors were very generous with their samples as well, and you could be easily filled up just from the samples. The bread stand just right at the entrance caught me, and I indulged in their custard cream filled donuts, definitely a must-try! There were many stands with rolls, roasts and burgers, another must-try! I got to say though, a few pounds here and there do add up, but it is totally worth it than going to a pub or restaurant since you can get different kinds of foods. As my post titles, this is a foodie heaven.||April 29, 2015
Traveleando||50||We left Merylebone with the bikes in our way to the market. It's an amazing experience and a great way to know a different London. The market was all we thought we will encounter and more. Great places to eat and drink, full of a lively ambience. My recommendation is to walk and discover all the possibilities before letting yourself induce by the first temptation. There are so many options and all with great looks. If you are a cheese lover like me you will feel like heaven at the cheese shops, we took some for enjoying later. After a great afternoon we went back to the bikes and off to the streets of London.||April 29, 2015
KatieL346||50||A must see if you like food!! Plenty of street food to choose from, stalls to buy food or foody gifts for others and a fantastic place to get your hands on the more unusual items you can't get in supermarkets. The best food market I have ever been to!!Plus you can always get a Pimms or a Sangia in the morning.||April 28, 2015
FlorisDW||50||A nice food market with all different kinds of food and styles. Nice atmosphere and a nice break from walking along the Thames. ||April 28, 2015
dt0809||40||Undoubtedly the best place to find food in London and one of the best experiences in the city. Went there a total of 4 times during my 8-day stay in London. Absolutely loved the brownies by Olivier's Bakery. Sausage rolls (sold for charity) at one of the stalls were also the best I've ever had. I'm a huge mustard lover and bought some mustard from Fitz Fine Foods back too. Great pasta too. Love this place. The duck confit sandwich was a tad disappointing though. Ciabatta wasn't great and the duck confit was too dry. Would be great if there're some seats for people to sit, and if the washrooms could get an upgrade.||April 28, 2015
aldo17||40||Not your usual market. Food and drink from almost every country imaginable to eat there and then (seats are not easy to find) or to take away. Very busy - spend a little or a lot! Situated under the railway lines and next to Southwark Cathedral - many people use the churchyard to sit and eat their food. Handy for The Shard. Very cosmopolitan. Worth a look, even if you don't want to eat - the cooking smells may change your mind!||April 28, 2015
travelexperts919||30||Borough market, where to begin. The food there is brilliant and you can stock up for the rest of the week. The fish and meat is to die for and there is even a Gelato shop. The noise and atmosphere will make your mouth water. There is nothing better than taking in the smell before buying a fudge paker brownie. I wouldn't recommend going if you are going on a diet as some of the food is very sugary. remember to visit the green market for more universal food||April 28, 2015
kr1313||50||Wonderful little market with street food, cheeses, meats, bakeries and other edibles -- only a few shops had anything you couldn't consume. Bustling and atmospheric -- it's tucked under a busy set of railroad tracks. A delight to explore!||April 27, 2015
R9783QKkarenc||40||Went on my term break with a fellow teacher, we had great falafel wraps, but was disappointed no grilled cheese. Will have to go back again!||April 27, 2015
flyhermes||50||I went on a Thursday at lunch before a reservation at Roast (please read my review) and we enjoyed it. It's the solution instead of going during the weekend when it's very busy. On this occasion we could stroll gently from place to place, taste almost everything and have a real conversation or advice from the sellers. Bought Indian chai tea to be prepared with cardamom by yourself at home along with a very interesting advice about when to add the honey or the milk, three different jams (one with whiskey), white truffle honey (on cheese it's a killer), chocolate wine and different beers that I have never heard in my life. Ah, one more thing: do not eat before. Go starving.||April 27, 2015
pat_norman||40||Borough Market was an obsession my friends had, and it was quite impressive. The cheese in particular (and mulled wine!) was great on a really cold day in London. Highly recommend if you're looking to prepare a meal at your accommodation rather than head out for dinner - the produce is fresh and delicious and there's huge variety.||April 27, 2015
MrB1967||50||The freshest fish, a healthy fruit smoothie, an obscure French cheese, Truffle oil, the hottest chillies, or Zebra and Kangaroo burgers! - Not only is it great fun hunting out the obscure and unusual here (And free to enter), but the people working there seem to be so happy and having so much fun - even on a horrid rainy Saturday afternoon.OK, prices are a little on the high side if you simply want some Edam and a fresh lettuce, but as an afternoon out, or fixing a surprise for a loved one, or a last minute "heaven's I can't think of anything" - this is a super if busy venue. My daughter is a student living near, and says you can almost eat for free with all the samples being dished out, but you can also spend a fortune if your a bit of a foodie!Great fun, and on a practical side, a huge range of fresh produce on offer, along with some lovely restaurants and cafe's on the door step, and of course London's "Shard" just around the corner.||April 27, 2015
Championcheapo||40||We wandered upon this market and the food and veggie stalls looked wonderful. We were trying to find another place and by the time we returned the food vendors had closed and happy hour was in full swing. The place certainly was lively both times but sad to have missed tasting the offerings saw ostrich eggs even.||April 26, 2015
travlife||40||Very popular market . Be sure to walk all around. Some areas could be missed. So much food. Had a delicious venison burger. Some other items as well as food . Just steps from Borough High Street tube.||April 26, 2015
Dalry||40||The selection of food is amazing--there is something for everyone: caviare to hotdogs, organic iced tea to wine. The baked goods are wonderful, the turkish delight is irresistible (I did a taste test and ended up buying 2 lbs!), and the atmosphere unique. Highly recommend the Scotch eggs with arugula salad or sweet potato fries. Try to avoid the busy lunch hour. Minimal toilet facilities and always a long line up--so go first!!||April 26, 2015
percywozere||50||If you enjoy tasting different foods you have to visit borough market! Make sure you go there with an empty stomach. Amazing!!||April 26, 2015
bubbagu||40||Went to borough market with a friend for a birthday lunch/drinks, such a lively atmosphere lots of things to see, places to eat and drink. I went when the weather was nice which I think added to the atmosphere. So easy to get to buy public transport.||April 25, 2015
bdearl41||50||Located in a cool spot of London, this is a great place to soak in some fun atmosphere and eat some great food. Walking around the market on a sunny afternoon and trying all the goodies is a great way to break up sightseeing in London. Go during the week when its a little less crowded. Make sure to try some of the Sausages from the restaurant at the north entrance. Bring cash as most places operate more easily with cash. A little off the standard tourist route, its worth checking out. Within a 10 minute walk of the Globe and Tate Modern.||April 24, 2015
Doris T||50||It is the food market with a lot of choices, don't eat too much before go or you will regret. I ate oyster, roast pork bread, the spainsh seafood fried rice, coffee and fresh juice, and it all delicious. You must try the ice-cream, it is so impressive and I am missing it. You can also buy some gourmet as souvenirs, e.g. jam, oliver oil, with low price and good quality.||April 23, 2015
Christine N||40||Great food market. So much to taste and see. Definitely worth a visit. Had some amazing cheese and straight out of the oven sausage roll||April 22, 2015
GlamNik7||50||Love this place and any chance i get i go back. Recently visited when the market was shut and the bars were buzzing, great vibe.||April 22, 2015
SimeyTravels||50||We very happily spent over an hour here, early on a Saturday morning. When we first arrived, some of the vendors were still getting set up (I wasn't kidding when I said it was early), but most of them were up and ready to sell. Our first pass through the market was just to get our bearings, and see what was on offer. On our second pass, we started making purchases. Coffee from this vendor for him, a chai latte from this vendor for me. Then, on our next pass, we started paying particular attention to the food stalls (of which there are many many much).I was impressed by the sheer variety of foods and food stuffs available. You could get anything from freshly baked breads to Thai street food, freshly-squeezed organic juices to paella, goat cheese, milks and ice creams to macarons, oils and sauces to fruits and granolas. It was a food-lover's paradise, and it was hard to choose.But, eventually, choose we did. We made ourselves a little breakfast and then continued our walk around the market. It didn't take long to see everything there was to see, but I did enjoy taking in the different scents along the way. I so wish we had something like this in my neck of the woods. It reminded me of Chelsea Market in New York, but outdoors and a lot less crowded. If we had something like this near us, I'd be a frequent shopper. I wish we had had more time to spend there!||April 22, 2015
NellyBell55||50||Busy, bustling place chock full of places to eat and buy food. Best of all you can taste so much. We loved it. ||April 21, 2015
PipVickery||50||This was our first time at Borough Market and it was great. Just seeing all the different food on display and getting to taste some of it before you bought was just the ticket. Easy to get to from London Bridge station and if you haven't been you need to. The cheeses alone are worth going for.||April 21, 2015
Amit A||50||We found this place entirely through trip advisor when we were looking for local markets - similar to what you would find in Barcelona or Rome or Lisbon - and the reviews pointed to this being as delightful as anywhere else.We headed over to the Market from the Shard, a mere 5 min walk, and as soon as you enter the energy of the place, the diversity of food on offer and the aroma through the market grips all senses. My wife and I quite literally went a little cuckoo with all that we could stuff our faces with. We went for Ethiopian beef, pulled pork and pints of London Lager on outpr first day.After deciding that just one trip to the market doesn't do it justice, we returned the following day - our last in London - to sample more. This time ww opted for Vietnamese Chicken Curry, Scottish. venison Burgers and a BBQ Beef Wrap.I think it's safe to say that this market will form a must-do on our future trips to London.A word of advise to first time visitors - whilst its difficult not to get carried away, have a look around the whole place before deciding what to have for your meal(s) - the choice is baffling and its hard not top opt for the first station you see!A must visit.||April 20, 2015
AngusLCK||50||The market is just amazing, with all the fresh ingrediants, makes you happy if you love to cook! It's a shame that I am just visiting London from Asia and cannot bring all those fresh food back home... The fresh buns and bread are also great for breakfast there!||April 20, 2015
lucythomas17||50||Come back to this market every time that I am in London and am always impressed with the wide range of food available. From savory gourmet hotdogs to sweet chocolate brownies and fudge, this market has the perfect food for you. A must visit if you are in London/a perfect place for a quick lunch if you're a local.||April 20, 2015
Bekkycat||50||On our last trip to London we loved the choice of street food at Notting Hill market. So thought we would give this a try for our breakfast/lunch on Saturday. The place is absolutely buzzing with food lovers, the choice is amazing we had a duck wrap for £6 which was beautiful. We then tried a Chinese chicken rice and noodles dish for £5, then we had a cup of traditional lemonade for £2.50 which was so refreshing. U could have any type of food u like at this place it's amazing and very reasonable for the quality of the food produced. On our next trip to London we will 100% be back her for a spot of lunch||April 20, 2015
Sally F||50||Took a food experience tour around the market and experienced the hustle and bustle, tastes and exquisite smells of the market and what it had to offer.||April 20, 2015
zoe9392015||50||The best Market I have ever seen. So much of everything, best olives, meats, cheeses. Overwhelming in baked goods homemade breads, sweets, honey, you name it they have it. The food stands and the variety left me speechless. Thanks Michelle for taking your Mom to this Market. Next time when I visit London Borough Market is on my list!||April 19, 2015
Syphasound||50||Decided to visit the market as a spur of the moment thing as the weather was really good.It was great strolling around all the independent food stalls - picked up some fresh fruit, chutneys and teas.We then had some street food from one of the retailers there - a hot prawn wrap. Was really tasty.Great day out||April 19, 2015
274pip02||50||What a wonderful market. All the traders were really friendly. Lots of samples to try bought some great cured meats and cheeses and the wild garlic mayo has been a great find! A bit of a wait for cooked food but well worth it, the scallops and stir fry were cooked to perfection, my daughter had a venison burger which was super juicy. My husband son thought the pies and bratwurst were fab. The lovely fresh juices finished it all off perfectly. Would definitely go again.||April 18, 2015
TravelReviewer1983||50||Okay, it might be too overcrowded on the weekend, but you've got to love this market. Such an incredible variety of foods won't leave you disappointed. Also a great place for delicious vegan food including desserts. Most dishes go for £5 so definitely affordable. ||April 18, 2015
May903||50||organic food for all, but mostly London, bright breezy, and fun, it's not cheep, but there's cooked food to eat and drink as well,it's a great experience,more stalls, selling every kind of food, from fresh veg, to drink, and huge cooking vats to see, enjoy it, as much as I did, the nearest tube is London Bridge, the market is almost oppesiteThe days change, I think it's Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, but vp heck on there web site, as I believe they can change||April 17, 2015
Vacationhugger||40||Love this market. For all it's fresh everything. Veggies.. The Breads! The Cheese! The Meat! The Olives!! It was hard to decide which of what we wanted there was so much variety. The smells are so tantalizing especially if you are already hungry. We just could not leave without buying enough for a picnic. They even poured the wine into take out cups for us - how great is that!!!||April 17, 2015
Cait C||50||I've been back to Borough Market three times as a tourist all on separate occasions, and have fell in love with it more every time! Wonderful food and atmosphere with reasonable prices - highly recommend for an authentic London experience without so much of the touristy feel. ||April 16, 2015
sandbites||50||It is a food streetfair overload. Lots of food, cheese, cakes chocolates and pastries. Must visit when in London. Check opening days/ time before you come. Bring cash and lots of it. Come on an empty stomach. Lots of meet, game birds, pate, rabbit pate, sandwiches of all kinds.||April 16, 2015
Jason C||50||Anyone who loves food must make a trip to the Borough Market in London. With just about everything you can imagine to satisfy your gastronomical needs, this market is an amazing experience. It does get incredibly crowded, but don't let that deter you from experiencing it. Make sure you do a complete walk through before deciding on a meal, as the worst thing you can do is get food envy once you've chosen.||April 16, 2015
KeeleyGray472||50||A number of people recommended this place to me when I said I was visiting London.It is an amazing place, full of market stalls with lots to buy. The atmosphere is fantastic and its lovely to walk around. I could stay here all day!Beware that Saturday is a very busy day with lots of people. But its worth it to enjoy the experience.||April 16, 2015
Spoonermomma1||50||If you love food, and markets and interesting people - you must come to Borough Market! We loved it here! Get off at London Bridge station, a quick few steps and you have arrived to market and food heaven. Plenty of samples from chocolate to tea to wagu beef. It would be so hard to walk through the market and not buy anything. We all tired something different. I had a chicken and mushroom pie from Pieminister - delish! My girls had bratwurst and my husband ate every last sample he could get because he couldn't decide! The hustle and bustle of the market is authentic and not commercialized. Great coffee and the produce was wonderful if we lived in London, I would shop there.||April 15, 2015
Sieh F||40||I chance upon this weekend market when i went to Vinopolis. It is located just beside each other. The variety of fresh food and even drinks surprises me. Very pack but it is definitely worth the squeeze and queue. Love it here as Foodie is my middle name. Not to forget to try out their home made sausages. And even the Salted Beef Sandwiches. Remember to bring along extra stomach to fully enjoy all the food n drinks...||April 15, 2015
alexontour||30||Nice place to go to soak up the atmosphere. Not a huge amount of choice.It's so busy here though expect massive queues for cooked food||April 15, 2015
OnionKing||40||Absolutely amazing place! Turkish candies, Italian cheeses, Spanish jamón ibérico - here you can find whatever you want.Specialist food market in London Bridge. Great place to wander through and get inspiration or to pick up some lunch. Lots of little cafes and florists dotted around the place. Perfect for getting specialist foods that may not be available at the local supermarket.||April 14, 2015
ArienZ||40||Lots of good food and colourful market to visit.We had a quick lunch here, and there were lots of ppl (locals and tourists).Worth a visit. Defo better than most food markets in other countries ||April 14, 2015
njdixiedarling||50||We originally went to the Borough Market on a Sunday. Although we knew the vendors were only there on Th.-Sun., we had read that it was open for lunch everyday. There there really wasn't much open on Sunday, so we went back on our last day in London, Thursday. We were so glad that we did! It did not disappoint. A lot of vendors and way too much to choose from because everything sounded delicious. One of my 14-year-old-boys had a kangaroo burger from the exotic meat booth. We also tried the Vietnamese Chicken Curry, homemade gnocchi with pesto, smoothies and ice cream from The Greedy Goat. Highly recommend to anyone who is interested in food.Only negative is that it is crowded and we never saw tables. We stood and ate, but for some, it be hard to do.||April 14, 2015
sandbites||50||There are food stalls everywhere for every budget and every taste bud. I think there are some tables where you can sit but i think this is more of a SRO area. They sell pulled pork sandwiches to salted beef and scotch eggs. Its chockfull of people so watch your wallet. Bring cash as most stores accept cash only. There's sandwiches, pastries, cakes and home made chocolates for all gastronomic tastes. Check the schedule before you visit as the food market are only open on certain days ||April 14, 2015
Mariangel8||50||A must-visit destination for food lovers. Lots of fresh produce available as well as freshly cooked food available in stalls. Only selected shops have a very small allocation of seats, so be prepared to eat whilst standing. Queues tend to move efficiently, but it's extremely busy here on weekends year-round so if you have the option to go on a weekday, definitely take advantage of it.||April 14, 2015

Its in a nice location next to a beautiful church, and has been set up with attention to detail. The stalls are beautiful with a large variety of produce.The vendors are passionate and knowledgable about their products.An unmissable place if you are a foodie person, so much high quality merchandise.Not forgetting the food stalls, lots of choice for lunch or dinner, eat around the world but don't expect to sit down at peak times not a chance !!||April 13, 2015
769jg||40||If you are fan of good quality food this then place. There is basically every thing you will ever need from Truffle to grass wheat shots!!!!! I love this place and cant say enough good things. There is a special mention to the lads who make the large roll sandwiches near the church cant remember their name but follow the Que. If in London this one of my favourite attractions.||April 13, 2015
kjpj90||50||Just happened to stumble upon this huge market on a trip to London Bridge. To say I was taken aback by the scope of it would be an understatement! It was absolutely buzzing with people and there was a great atmosphere around the place. I ate a Roast to Go, but it was a toss up between this and about 4 other food stalls. Great experience.||April 13, 2015
Kimberley L||30||Destination market,,,,some cool stalls - food a rip off - but then this is LONDON....Wagyu beef burger - £7.50 :) Cool stalls - breads, tea, spices, olive oils..etc etc very 'touristy'. Box ticked.||April 13, 2015
Amelia S||40||I am a foodie and I greatly enjoyed walking around this market to take in all that was for sale. So much variety, it was difficult to decide what to eat. Again like most markets it was crowded but festive. My two young adult children both had Indian food that was reasonable priced, quite filling and delicious. I opted for a sausage sandwich that was quite good; however, really wish I had tried the pork! We topped it off with some huge cookies that were great. If you enjoy food, this is one place you shouldn't miss.||April 12, 2015
RaeRaeC||50||I love markets and the Borough market is one of the best. Amazing stalls- bread, cheese, sweets, produce and meets. Ginger Pig for sausages is one of the best. Can get pretty crowded so go early to avoid the crowds.||April 11, 2015
veritas59915||50||We often include Borough Market on our agenda! Great atmosphere and excellent street food! We ate heaps of fresh salad and omelette at Total Organics! Then freshly squeezed juices at their neighbouring stall! Bought lots of lovely food from other stalls including truffle spread and garlic selection (smoked, wet, and huge pink). Then walked along South bank in glorious sunshine - back to Covent garden- fabulous day out!!||April 11, 2015
ellie27ish||50||I was so excited walking around the market! I sampled various foods out on show to try. It was great to see the more unusual fruit and veg that you can buy and some of it was a great price. We had sangria which was delicious and got a 'Boston Burger' from Boston Sausage which was amazing! I'm definitely going back!||April 11, 2015
greggh438||50||I love coming to borough market. It's great for tourists wanting a quick snack or mooch around sampling all the various foods or even if your a local doing your local shop. Right outside London Bridge tube I could quite easily spend a whole afternoon here||April 10, 2015
AngelCadaval||40||The crowd jewel of the London food and veg market.A well known market popular with tourists and locals alike, has abundant amount of premium fresh, aged, ready to eat food and drinks to offer. I imagine most of its visitors probably won't have the cash to afford to use this market as their main source of food. Still, it doesn't stop us from browsing through the vast range of innovative and sometimes exciting produce, looking for the next piece of impulse buy.||April 10, 2015
hillbilly125||50||enjoyed the market and viewing the different wares available - we decided to pick up lunch and were amazed at the range of food and treats available.a good buzzy atmosphere too - would recommend a quick stop off for lunch and to pick up some local goods to take home.||April 10, 2015
Mr_Andy_Smith||50||Visitors to London often end up spending a lot of money on food, but for under £10 you can fill your boots with delicious food at the delightful Borough Market which is nestled in the shadow of the Shard at London Bridge. My favourite is the huge hog roast sandwich and the delicious generously sized succulent brownies. What will you choose? If there are queues don't be put off, they move quickly! Go early in your visit to London and I guarantee you will come back and take a tasty treat or two or three to enjoy later in the day. You don't have to pay the earth to have a little taste of heaven.||April 10, 2015
Brian M||40||I always get the feeling that a lot of this is style over substance but as a touristy place it's fine. When you have had enough head for the Wheatsheaf for a top class beer!||April 9, 2015
AJA A||50||So many wonderful different foods and flavours, you can get fresh produce which you can try before you buy. The selection of hot food is amazing and all well priced. I live in London so am lucky enough to come to Borough Market a few times a year."It's well worth a visit"||April 9, 2015
Becky B||50||I visited Borough market for the first time on Saturday with some friends and I was very impressed with the wide variety of stalls! I also loved the fact that a large amount of the stalls offer yummy free samples of their produce! It has a great atmosphere and feels as though you are stepping back in time to Olde London. (I quite expected Oliver Twist to walk round the corner!) It was a hidden treasure and I will most definitely return! ||April 9, 2015
Jane D||50||What a great place to eat fresh homemade food and the prices are not too bad either!! Even my 14 year old had the dosa pancakes and polished off all the salad too!,,||April 9, 2015
ElephantRider2||50||We had to see what all the fuss was about, now I've been I understand why! Even though it's a spring holiday, so loads of the stalls where not open, it was still amazing! So many foods to try and drinks to taste. It was all amazing and the cheeses and the wines and meats.... It was all very good. I spent hours browsing. If you had not built up a appetite, then there is no point In being there, it's all food and drink. Definitely recommending to my rider friends, Back to trekking on my elephant, Elephant Rider.x ||April 9, 2015
Peter H||50||This is the first time I have walked around this market. It is fantastic. There is so much choice of food. The cheeses are majestic. Next time I go I will have try a few meals.||April 9, 2015
EmilyHaegs||50||Loved it all - the fresh cheeses and meats, the local fish, the sights and smells and tastes. I could have stayed all morning and eaten myself stupid. As it was, had to call it a day following duck confit salad, a hunk of gruyere and hot gnocchi and pesto. Highly recommend it to any food lovers.||April 9, 2015
Doris C||50||I had a wonderful day out to Borough Market last year. It was around spring last year, I remember the Cherry Tree was in full bloom in the near by church yard. So many stalls selling so many different types of food and spices, perfect for any foodies out there. It was quite cold so we treated ourselves to a hot pie and mash each, served in a cardboard box with gravy! You would think that gravy in a box would be a recipe for disaster but no . . . it works and it was absolutly perfect for a cold day. Well worth a trip, the fish stalls are a must see.||April 9, 2015
RichardMcInroy||50||A buzzy, atmospheric haven for foodies and people watchers. Love this place! Great food, drinks, stalls and restaurant close by. Tube station just outside which makes life so much easier. I've had street food off numerous stalls, but 'Soul Food' is my favourite. Such amazing flavours, and the 'Chicken Box' is to die for!||April 9, 2015
Joan P||50||How wrong I was. It was a most amazing place. Every type of breads, cheeses and vegetables. Then to the stalls ofinternational food cooking, to tempt your appetite. Loads of samples to try first. So much choice, we could have spent all day there.||April 8, 2015
travelswiththebear||50||With so many wonderfully different flavours and smells this is lunchtime heaven. I had the most amazing onion bhajis and vegetable samosas, plus shared a salted beef, mustard and gherkin sandwich - awesome!!!||April 8, 2015
zeke421912||30||While exploring the London Bridge area, including the George Inn, Southwark Cathedral,stopped in this semi-open air market. Lots of different foods, giving an atmosphere of what living in this area of London is like. Enjoyed lunch.||April 8, 2015
TAalice||40||Close to London Bridge tube station and a good place to go to to experience an open market on a sunny day. Kappacasein's cheese toastie was yummy. We also enjoyed doughnuts of Bread Ahead. The market was quite crowded when we went at noon but we still had a good time. Coffee at Monmouth was good too but personally I don't consider it particularly good and, IMO, it's okay to skip the coffee if there is an extremely long queue and you cannot afford the time to wait.||April 7, 2015
BridieMcB||50||If you need truffle oil...this is the place to go! Really loved this market and the buzz around it. The food is fantastic and its worth while picking up your lunch at one of the stands||April 7, 2015
787Balazs_||50||We have really enjoyed the place - unfortunately we went there a little bit early, at 9am when the half of the stalls were closed, but the advantage was that there was no big crowds of people. We enjoyed fresh oysters, goat cheese, coffee, mustard, everything with a good taste and atmosphere.||April 7, 2015
caz_bpool||40||Visited borough market over Easter. Had a great time walking round. Wasn't as big as I imagined. Foods reasonably priced. Plenty of street food or there are cafes and restaurants off the market. Great location. Would go back if in the area. ||April 7, 2015
Trusstytraveller||40||You could spend hours in the markets looking around and getting lost and immersed in the culture. The smells of the market, the cheeses and the cooked foods were amazing. I wanted to try everything. A must visit, to feel and live the English market history.||April 6, 2015
Amy M||50||The delicious smells you encounter from the stalls as you enter will definitely tempt you to buy something. On Saturday I feasted on a duck confit sandwich and sizzling gyoza. I love the way you can find food from every part of the world here: Authentic Italian olive oils, Polish beers, fresh Spanish paella and so much bread, cheeses and cake I didn't know where to look. One stall was selling fresh oysters with tobasco. It's an amazing place to buy groceries and feast on street food.||April 6, 2015
Nannagabby||40||At first entering borough market can feel alittle daunting. Nestled in between the city the hundreds of people can be off putting. However I recommend you fight the urge to walk away as the moment you walk through your senses become enlightening. Me and my friends got a burger and fries from one of the food stands and it was delicious followed by a brownie which I have to say was scrumptious. It's a credit to london. My only negative side is the toilets, there's only one cubical per sex and there's a massive wait but don't let that put you off. When in London you have to learn to queue. Ha||April 5, 2015
DanielK329||50||We really do love food with my wife, so Borough Market was no.1 choice where to go in London. This is really different type of markets I´ve ever seen. You can buy whatever you want - vegetable, meat, seafood, fresh pasta, truffle, cider from a barrel, sweets,... It was one of the biggest choice in a market i my life. Borough market was the first place I´ve tried oyester:-) Delicious. We also tried some ciabbatta with rocket and apple sauce. Also fantastic. It is simple. If you are fancy some good street food you have to visit this market in the very city centre of London just couple of minutes walking distance from Tower bridge!||April 5, 2015
PhilWCroydon||30||Borough Market has sadly turned into a mass tourist showcase which is good for London but not so good if you want to find well priced fare. The traders do provide a a spectacular array of tasty delights but it is clear many are milking the new found interest in the market. Everything looks amazing and all credit to the market organisers for ensuring the quality is so high it is just a shame that everything is so expensive. We managed to spend £100 and came away with just a few bags of goodies. We have been given a tip off that there is a better value offering nearby but I am going to keep this a secret as the food on offer is apparently just as good but half the price.||April 5, 2015
PhantomFlanFlinger||50||My partner and I visited on the Easter Weekend. It was very busy with a fair bit of bumping and jostling, but we went knowing it would be.The selection and variance in stalls was excellent, with nearly all the food stalls offering a free little taste of their produce. The staff were always knowledgeable and willing to talk freely about how and what was in their food and drink.We tried a venison burger whilst we were there and it was excellent.Certainly well worth a visit and a great way to spend an hour or two.||April 5, 2015
jennyandmike||50||I love this area and could mooch around it all day. There is so much lovely food and offer to buy and to taste. Well worth a visit. We combined this with the Tower of London and Tower Bridge which was a great but exhausting day.||April 5, 2015
Gengis25||50||This is the first time I've visited Borough Market and it was absolutely amazing. It was Easter Saturday and it was extremely busy but that didn't detract from the incredible experience. It is visually stunning with fantastic displays at every turn. The smells and tastes to be taken in as you walk through tempt you at every corner and deciding on what you actually want to eat is so hard to do. The food stalls really are amazing and they show what good food, and good British food is all about! As it was a quick trip into the capital I'm jealous of the locals who can go in regularly to try something different each time!!!||April 5, 2015
Hkjkjkkk||50||Had read a lot about this market so decided to visit . We walked from Waterloo station along the Thames and as soon as we entered the market you are greeted with so many smells of food not fried onions lol .this is a foodies dream Lyon can eat your way around the world so much food so little time. We had a glass of prosecco and nibbled on cheese bread olives dried sausage black pudding humous so so many . It's a real must if you love food and quality food font let the word Market fool you such class food well worth a visit . ||April 5, 2015
Jacobny||50||wow this is awesome! a must do!!!full of incredible food, cool people and some good drinks too...is expensive as the negative reviews point out, but hey, go to lidl if u want cheap stuff...this is all proper, real food. fully reccomend.||April 4, 2015
ianp228||50||Next time you visit London, make sure that Borough Market is on the list.This is must see location for some of the finest ingredients available, from truffles to pies, chocolates to cheese, many restaurants abound in the area.||April 4, 2015
World_Traveler_DR||50||A great market that is one of the oldest in London. A wide range of fresh products , organic, homemade, local farms etc.Wonderful food stands, samples, quick meals, worth a visit.||April 4, 2015
MsAngelia||50||We love food so the market is a must. We especially enjoyed Tea2You, not just the tea, which was great, but the discussion about teas and the wonderful service from the staff member.Our favourite was the pies from PieMinister. I also liked the stall that had all the Turkish delight, nuts and baklava. It's a great market, and next to it, one of the oldest cathedrals in England. Don't miss it!||April 3, 2015
JulieandPete||50||This a proper London market which only sells food and drink. Everything you would need is here. Very busy place and hot food is available to buy. Well worth a visit.||April 3, 2015
calitocam||50||This is absolutely one of my favorite places on Earth. I've been four times now and each time I've loved it more than the last. Although, I do spend a small fortune eating and drinking my way through it. I've been on Saturday and Sunday which are both very busy, but help to lead towards the atmosphere. I made the mistake this passed week of going on Monday and even though the website said that it was open, only about 10-15% of the stalls were open. I talked to a vendor who told me that the dead scene I was walking through was actually busy for a Monday! So, if you're going to go, he (and now I) suggest Thursday or Friday if you want to go during the week.||April 3, 2015
Saqni||10||I still cant believe this market being this expensiveWent there with my husband thinking we can buy some good stuff every stall we went was sooo expensive we havent bought anything ||April 2, 2015
Nader A||40||Duck confit sandwiches, roasted hog, boston sausage, turkish lokum, cheese and olive stick, the berliner .. these were the things I tried and I wish I was able to try more but I was stuffing myself! I was full but still wanted to eat more! Everything was delicious, not overpriced, BUT - and that's why I gave it 4 stars, not 5 - you may not enjoy eating your sandwich if you go on weekends as it gets packed and overcrowded.Overall a great experience and every visit to London MUST be accompanied by a visit to Borough Market, but I'd avoid the weekends.Will definitely recommend the duck confit sandwich, £5.||April 2, 2015
JJRK_12||50||This is a great stop for lunch or a snack if seeing the sites in the area. There is an amazing selection of food vendors all of high quality and in great variety. This is a classic outdoor food market selling prepared foods, cheeses, charcuterie, produce and meat.||April 2, 2015
Joe C||50||Every time I visit I spend the whole day there, a brilliant day out. Especially if you include a pub lunch!||April 2, 2015
yopiyth||10||From iconic to visit place the market been convert to tourist catch overprice houl - you buy plastic tomatoes pretend to be "ceur beuf", for £6:50 a kilo..., fishermen prices, well better not coment...get today some ravioli from the Italians "pasta masters", the young guy even didn't know what the ravioli stuffed with...and push me to get some "prawns ravioli", which been crab ones -£8+ and back home you even can not breath of the "off" smell...Shame, shame, shame on such a venue...||April 1, 2015
Helen D||50||Yes, it's packed on the weekend but you really just have to bite the bullet and head on in! Very close to the London Bridge tube station. There is an enormous amount of food vendors here. It is a great place to have lunch. Check out the web page and then check out the reviews for the vendors. Sorry we were only able to make one visit!||April 1, 2015
Jessica812823||50||A variety of food to choose from. feel the bustling crowd, food smell from everywhere make me want to try every food stall. Will visit here again.||April 1, 2015
steven b||50||A must-do for anyone visiting London and likes food.The foodstands offer a wide range and the few things we tasted were very good.||April 1, 2015
610suew||50||We had some time to visit before we dropped in to Vinopolis. Wonderful selection of street food, cheese, oils, fresh fruit and veg, lovely fresh juices and so many other things. I had delicious King Prawn Pad Thai, all freshly cooked while I waited. £6.99 is really good value. I ate in the undercover area and watched some of the cookery demo. There is a small car park but tricky to find in the one way streets, but for £4 we got two hours parking right in the market. This was not our first visit and won't be the last. It does get very crowded on Saturdays and between 12 and 1.30pm. Try to get in a little earlier if you want to avoid the crowds. ||March 31, 2015
Weinmann11||50||We woke up early on our Saturday in London to go check out Borough Market. Most everyone we talked to said it was not to be missed. Our original intention was to get some breakfast / brunch food there. You won't find that but there are plenty of food vendors serving an endless variety of food that all looks delicious. I can vouch that what we ate tasted as good as it looked. On cool days there are also some vendors dealing out mulled wine and hot cider. Getting a couple tasty adult beverages in while strolling through the shops was priceless.Good selection of meat and cheese vendors as well... All giving free samples. We picked up some snacks and a bottle of wine for nibbles later that night.It does start to get very crowded around 1130 or so, but again, if you get there early, you will have a great time and avoid the crowds!||March 31, 2015
mdmortenson||50||An amazing selection of food vendors here. Wines, ciders, cheese, bread, cured meats, plus lunch/dinner fare. Fresh pasta, venison burgers, thai, paella. My wife had fresh lobster ravioli and I went with the venison burger. Both were in the top three of the meals we had while on vacation to the UK!||March 31, 2015
r0bharris2||50||Wow what a food market. If you want to have lunch have it here. Its a must place to see. The only criticism its very busy. But dont let it put you off . Enjoy. ||March 31, 2015
Csupi||50||This is what i call streetfood heaven! So many delicious things to eat, from the traditional brittish pies to the indian cuisine. Great place||March 30, 2015
jwobkk||20||This place might be fantastic but seriously it is the most crowded food hall that I've ever seen. Crawling with tourists and their selfie sticks. How embarrassing. I couldn't get close to the food because the stalls are jammed with people.||March 30, 2015
Gilbois||50||Got great advice from Cam our concierge at Mondrian London @ Sea Containers to stop by Borough Market for lunch. This place is fantastic. High quality food, in a vibrant atmosphere. Amazing stalls and lovely restaurants if stalls aren't your thing. ||March 30, 2015
Amys_Hungry||50||This place is a must for visits to London, but make sure you take plenty of time and go on an empty stomach, because you'll want to try everything. The fruit & veg are amazing, cheeses, pasta, meats, pies, cakes, street food.....One trip was not enough. I look forward to my next visit!||March 30, 2015
MichelleJRae||50||Borough Market was my favourite place to eat while I was in London. The variety of foods offered is amazing, with cuisine from all over the world. I was never disappointed in my choice. From Baklava to Thai, from fresh juices to coffee and teas, Borough Market is permanently on my "must visit" list for all future trips to the city.||March 29, 2015
davismama2003||50||This market is fantastic! Just on the south end of London Bridge, and right outside of London Bridge tube station, this market is tons of fun. It's mostly food and drink, with a few spices and sauce vendors, but no antiques or handy crafts. The cheese selections and homemade savory pies are to die for, and out the north end of the market, don't miss the large collection of ready to eat food vendors, lots for vegetarians and vegans, but the cheese lovers and meat eaters will marvel at the selections here. Weekends are positively heaving with people so go early if you must on Saturday (closed on Sunday). The atmosphere and spectacle make up for the slightly elevated pricing.||March 29, 2015
Paula D||50||This market is amazing. Food stalls, veggies, bread, meat, wine, cheese. Just so much variety. You'll be able to find paella, fried squid, venison burgers, duck sándwiches, fresh pasta, veggie burgers, a glorious cheesy as hell cheese toastie, falafel wraps, argentinian empanadas, oysters and so much more! Price is ok, I wouldn't say it's cheap though. There are a bunch of people on Saturday but also the most stalls so you choose! It's good to visit the river bank área with beautiful views, the Tate Modern and Shakespeare's Globe just around the corner.||March 29, 2015
carolyn607||50||I stopped by borough market today. Haven't been there for years. Was pleasantly surprised by the lively atmosphere and the wonderful selection of foods. Ended up coming home with freshly baked bread and a great selection of cheeses for supper!||March 28, 2015
altens||50||Heading for the Shard on the bus and found this market, just wonderful , foods drinks atmosphere was just wonderful , brilliant worth a visit . Will be back.||March 28, 2015
JohnThai||50||Positioned at the southern end of London Bridge this is a gastronomical explosion on the senses. The freshest of products from around the country and europe especially cheeses. There are fresh meat stand, cooked meat stands. More types of ready to eat food than you can imagine. This is an experience not to be missed but be prepared to put on a few kilos in the process. A must visit place.||March 28, 2015
Caron R||40||first visit through this market and the atmosphere Buzz was electric,very busy,the fusion of food with aromatic smells mixed with food being offered for sale from all over the world,sampling a few was exciting,very tasty and the actual cost was unbelievably cheap,very fresh and vibrant,great place to visit , absorb the atmosphere and local produce mixed with international qualities from all over the world.||March 28, 2015
Xinnam||40||.. You definately want to go. Place to get your daily vegetables or just for fun, but notice that everyone else is there too. Little bit crowded at least on Saturday near closing time.||March 28, 2015
Elise C||40||Even if you are not visiting London to buy your weekly produce you should visit one of the oldest markets in Europe. I believe it operates Thursday to Saturday. Saturday being the busiest day. Make a morning out of it and go see what Londoners eat. While you are at it, have breakfast there at one of the many restaurants surrounding the market or in the market. You can get a coffee and a "bap" (bacon in a bun) pretty cheap. Interesting way to spend a Saturday morning and get to know the London Bridge area. Highly recommend it.||March 28, 2015
Jack K||50||The famous borough market, I've heard this market is one of the biggest in London and I look for bargains at markets usually and that's what I got. The prices were very good and the banter from the stall owners were very good. veg prices you can't beat!||March 28, 2015
mrsmarr||50||On a bright day one of the nicest things to do in London is to get down to the south bank at wetminster and stroll along the river to borough market ....apart from the amazing food stalls there are amazing stands serving very tasty 'in hand ' dishes (hot and cold) to eat and enjoy.||March 27, 2015
djw1955||50||As usual, visited Borough Market and spent two hours looking around this wonderful market. The atmosphere is electric and even more so near the end of the week, but I love it. Enjoy tasting the free samples, chatting to the Vendors and learning from them on some excellent cooking tips. No pushing, no atmosphere to annoy a person, just complete friendliness. Well worth a visit.||March 27, 2015
markc534||50||Huge range of fresh and prepared foods at relatively competitive prices (for London), there should be something for everyone be they a meat lover or a vegetarian. Could do with a few more benches to sit down,||March 27, 2015
ChrisArlVa||50||Borough Market is easily accessible from the Jubilee and Northern Tube Lines. Great selection of cheeses, cured meats, seafood, spices and produce you find anywhere else in London.The reason I go weekly though is Bread Ahead who also has a baking school in the market. I also pick up orders for neighbors who are fans.Their brown wholemeal sourdough is addictive and other standouts are the cheese and olive sticks, raisin baguette, fennel multigrain sourdough, hazelnut and almond brownies and fresh doughnuts.The staff is friendly and helpful.||March 27, 2015
CinteS||50||No worries if you don't want to do grocery shopping. This market is good enough for a visit. When we first arrived it was almost noon and as everybody else we can't help it but try warm food available. My husband get a chance to taste Goat Milk Ice Cream, i get my Lavendar, we even bought few Berries to eat while walking around. ||March 26, 2015
Beodricksworth-44||50||Without a doubt! My favourite lunchtime food haunt is Gujarati Rasoi which serves vegetarian Indian food with superb flavours - it never disappoints. The market is great for cheeses and fresh and unusual vegetables. The best mozzarella we've ever bought came from here. Friendly and unusual and well worth a visit.||March 26, 2015
900gillianm||50||Wow I am so impressed by the Food market it was amazing, I highly recommend you make sure you visit and you will not be disappointed||March 26, 2015
DrewP5280||50||A great slice of wholesomne tasty, and foodie food. Best to go later in the week because it is quiet on Monday/Tuesday. It is reputed to be packed on weekends, so we went Thursday and had the perfect blend of numerous vendors and moderate crowds. Everything we tried and sampled was delicious.||March 26, 2015
mmc_80||40||It is an amazing place for foodies, a lot of variety. There are tons of stalls and a lot to see. Fresh food, fresh flowers, etc...||March 26, 2015
Anna E||50||My top and main tip is to go there hungry. You will be so disappointed if you eat before you go. In fact, Go there for breakfast, and by the time you have wandered round you can stay there for lunch as well!This place has something for everyone from paella to baklava to cheese and beyond. There are Ethiopian stalls, German stalls, Italian stalls, Polish Stalls, UK stalls with all the freshest food. The burgers are to die for but leave room for the German apple crumble cake slices!The bread stalls smell divine and all freshly cooked.I cannot rate this place high enough, its just awesome.||March 26, 2015
Glenda R||50||I love markets. I've been to them in Paris, London, Dehli, Udaipur, Jaipur, Rome, Tuscany, and more. The Borough is about the best. Everything you need for a scrumptious meal, vegetable stands, cheese mongers, fish, olives, oils, truffles, meats, salamis, meat pies, empanadas, sandwiches, sweets, and a ton more. It's a photographer's heaven, a cooks delight, and an olfactor's paradise.||March 25, 2015
Chris C||50||The aura of the borough market is fab! The smells s you walk closer are to die for and when you walk around the rustic stalls to some of the most divine food available to us you simply cannot help but feel hungry ! Don't forget to go to the rear of the market where the patisserie stalls are which have some superb pastries and cakes ! Also nestled above the market is a very nice restaurant called roast which uses lots of market brought ingredients and the menu is fantastic as is the service! Highly recommended !||March 25, 2015
MarcPT||50||You will find a million things you want to put in your mouth here, and that'll just be the beginning of your day's entertainment! Watch the crowds move by as you munch down on a warm Pie Minister, or join the large numbers of Champagne breakfasters in their early tipples. I personally would prefer to be there Saturday: yes it's busier but more atmosphere! Well priced, and the underground station is mere metres from the entrance. A must-do for foodies.||March 24, 2015
George P||50||Since the increase in popularity of food in general, these markets seem to crop up everywhere. I don't believe that any will share the history and quality of Borough though. I won't delve into the history of this place, there are plenty of websites that do that. I will say that you should be prepared for some serious decision making on what to eat. This is more of a market selling hot meals and snacks to be eaten there and then, rather a market of 'ingredients' to be taken home and enjoyed (although there is some of the latter). There is no point me listing examples of what on offer as I can't think of any cuisine that wasn't available. My wife had a salt beef, pickle and mustard roll that was still talked about weeks later, it was that good! I should have joined her, but opted for the salt and chilli squid instead which was still delicious. It's worth noting that this place can get extremely busy. We were there on a Saturday during the lunch period. I think this may have been the most crowded I've ever experienced, so be warned to avoid peak eating times if you don't like crowds. It's attractions like this that make us wish we lived in London full time. We can't wait to come back!||March 24, 2015
londonmcr||50||a mecca for food addicts especially if you like Oysters. Can get very crowded but still worth it. Always something new to taste/smell.||March 23, 2015
Sfc1704||50||Wow.. What a great selection of foods both savoury and sweet! Very busy (I visited on a Saturday so perhaps why).. If you can tolerate a crowd then please visit but also do not be deterred by the fact the market gets busy.. Everyone is there to enjoy the foods and browse so just embrace the hustle and bustle! I wish I had starved myself before I went as I was practically drooling over the many cuisines..I did manage a chocolate eclair with chocolate cream inside which was delicious, washed down with some cider.. A great place to visit and I will be heading back there during my next visit to London! ||March 23, 2015
Keith-B-Robinson||50||There are claims that Borough Market has been in existence for 1,000 years. This large, crazy, bustling, semi-chaotic marketplace has a reputation of selling fine foods from around the world. At bare minimum, it would take you a half hour to wander throughout the marketplace to just catch a glimpse of everything there. However, you could probably spend the better part of a full day ambling along and browsing/sampling each vendor's products. Fun!||March 23, 2015
Peter F||50||we had a really good time here, so much to see and taste and eat! Very busy but we felt quite safe and not hurried at all. We couldn't buy much due to luggage restrictions but well worth a visit and lots of nice places to walk and have lunch nearby||March 23, 2015
ascsroberts||50||Jump on the tuba to London Bridge and discover this gem. Forget breakfast overpriced in most hotels, just get there and have a pick of the best breads, pastries, unusual brunch choices in the little stalls and cafes, but fresh, really fresh, fruit and veg and get there early if possible for best choices. Lunch time trade is brisk too but all the fish stalls pack up early.||March 23, 2015
queen_ness||40||Borough Market has an incredible array of food and drink available in the arches and is brilliant to find something new to satisfy most palates. It's a beautiful place, albeit a little expensive. I'd recommend not relying on eating there though, just in case of the unlikely event that you don't see anything you fancy.||March 22, 2015
DCull||50||I love Borough market and often go just to look at the wonderful fare on offer there. But a word of caution try and avoid the lunchtime rush it gets manically busy and then it becomes very hard to appreciate the wonders on offer. ||March 22, 2015
alext570||40||Always a pleasure to visit this temple of gastronomy- it stocks a superb selection of organic fruit & veg, bakeries, charcuteriers, cheese merchants, fishmongers & butchers such as the renowned ginger pig. Such an atmospheric location & premises, adding to the pleasure of being there, whether just browsing or stocking up on gifts & goodies.||March 21, 2015
bcarspremierb||40||We went to fill in some time whilst on a day trip to London great mix of food from all over the world great testers and tasting too but be warned quite expensive place to shop.||March 21, 2015
WhiteRockers13||50||- wide variety of great food from the four corners of Britain, the seas and the Continent - food displays are photogenic and all were well maintained and inviting - everyone was friendly and helpful - delicious food to buy and ready to eat - lots of unique foods and displays||March 21, 2015
Linze K||50||This is a market just for food, but so crowded on Saturday, didn't feel like staying, however the fried squid is shocking good, not happy to share and wanted another for myself.||March 21, 2015
coley52||50||Spend an afternoon taking in the aromas of the open-air market in Southwark. We sampled paella, meat pies, oysters, cheese sandwiches, cheeses, boar and chorizo sausages, and meringues. There were many lovely produce stalls as well. It was a delectable experience, and I learned about cuisine from France, Spain, Greece, Italy, Scotland, Ireland, India, and England, to name a few countries. Particularly enjoyed Mr. Hayward's local oysters! Guess I will walk back to County Hall after feasting on so much good food!||March 21, 2015
Welltravelled1971||50||We visited London several times yet this was our first visit to the Borough Market. It is an easy tube ride to London Bridge station which can be accessible via the Jubilee Line or Northern Line. If you take the tube, when arriving at the London Bridge station, look for the signs that point you to the "way out" and pay attention for the "borough market" exit. Once you exit onto the street, you cross the road, walk 30 seconds down and you will reach the steps that will take you down to the market.We have been to outdoor markets in Madrid, Barcelona, Nice, Florence, and many more and I must admit the Borough Market held it's own. No need to plan on where to eat if you visit as there is plenty to eat when there. The booths range from herbal organic tea, to sourdough breads with olives, to venison burgers, to imported cheeses. There was a wine tasting shop, olive pots where you can take olives to go, freshly made doughnuts filled with caramel, focaccia, even a stand preparing espresso and cappuccinos. The market opens at 10am and closes at 5pm. Without exaggerating, you can comfortably have breakfast, lunch, and an early dinner there if you wish. Just be mindful you are outdoors so you are exposed to the elements. Seating might be an issue as well but if you don't care about standing in a corner somewhere eating a plate of tapas, then it's all good.If you are planning an itinerary, be mindful the market is close to The Shard, Tower of London, and Tower Bridge. It is a bit of walking though but well worth the adventure. Enjoy!||March 20, 2015
ania7ja||40||I've been there for the first time last Saturday. It is very busy and not cheap, but you can find there food from all over the world, so if you like to cook, this place would be perfect for you. You can find there every kind of food on this planet I think;)||March 20, 2015
MallikaNarayandelhi||50||A tube ride to London Bridge, and a 2 min walk brings you to the lively market, with farm produce, cheese, breads, cakes, pies , etc, to buy and loads of eateries, great place for a visit, wander and food.||March 20, 2015
Elwood_B_Blues||40||Borough Market has almost legendary status now, but in the past it was a local food market which attracted Londoners from miles around in much the same way as Billingsgate or Smithfield. Today, it is a bit of a tourist trap which thrives off its' past history. That said, it is still worth a visit and there are some very interesting stalls to purchase from. Personally, I would avoid the hot food stalls towards the river end of the market, you can do far better for more authentic food elsewhere and pay a fraction of the price. Some of the confectionery stalls are also probably best avoided, in particular those selling Macarons. When you have Laduree and others within a shot tube journey you will get infinitely better quality for similar prices.I did say there are some good purchases to be had, and I would look very closely at some stalls, because you can find some real foodie gems. I'll leave it for you to find them, as you would do the market a disservice if you just went to see a small selection of stalls. Please take time to have a good look around, the market is in a few bits and there is a fruit & veg stall which is set out to perfection.TIP- If you are a bit squeamish, or any of your party are, best avoid the butchery section as there are some sights those more sensitive might find a little upsetting.Over all, the market is a truly fascinating place, once you get away from the bits which are, in my opinion, over priced and aimed purely at relieving visitors of their money in exchange for poor quality there are great sights, and even greater people to chat with.||March 19, 2015
Juliana Y||40||Try it on a warm day, as there isn't really anywhere to sit inside and eat. The variety here is amazing, with local British produce and delicacies, as well as curries, Middle Eastern food and other international cuisine. Good for a day out on the river. ||March 19, 2015
Skye17skye||50||Oooo you can smell the food and all the spices and you have to try the food, good range of food and drink and at very good prices ||March 19, 2015
Heiko A||40||As someone before me has said; this is not a cheap place. But if you are looking for food from somwwhere around the world, this is the place. I was amazed at all the stuff that was to be found here. Just to walk around without buying anything is a great experience, let alone starting to buy things.||March 17, 2015
missxiying||50||loads of stalls with free food samples. we sampled and bought from a few different stalls and all the food is really nice. may be slightly over priced, but really, you don't have to buy anything.||March 17, 2015
captainmidwest||40||Went on Thursday. It was still busy but not like Friday or Saturday which we previously attended. My wife enjoys the church that is in close proximity to the market. Had visited three previous times. Bought chocolates, cookies, and also Ethiopian. All very good. Lots of selection for food and reasonably priced.||March 17, 2015
madabcatz||50||Amazing place to visit! Sights, smells, tastes, although very busy as I visited on a Saturday, it holds a very cultural atmosphere. Great for foodies! But be prepared to queue!||March 17, 2015
AnnS_16||50||If you love good, honest, fresh and diverse food, Borough Market is a must go! Whether you are Vegan, Gluten free or an Omnivore- this place has something for everyone. Don't miss out on the Vegetarian Indian Stall (forgot the name!) even if you are a meat eater! Also The Free From Bakehouse has amazing cakes and bakes for those with allergies, while not compromising on taste. Others in my group had fish and chips from Fish! which was also really top notch. Final words: Don't miss it!||March 17, 2015
ZoeTaylor94||30||I went here on Saturday morning- needless to say, that it was extremely busy. There are a variety of traders, selling take away food, sweets, bread, preserves, fresh fruit and veg, fish, meats and cheese and alcohol. Some stall holders are more friendly and helpful than others (people in general, really). If you want to eat at Roast, make sure you book in advance.||March 16, 2015
325seang||50||You can lose yourself in the maze of stalls and stands at this awesome market, the smells and sounds can be intoxicating, if you don't know what your after you could spend a small fortune, Go Early otherwise you'll be enjoying the Great British Pastime of the Que! though to be honest the quality of produce on offer is worth the wait. i had the best Venison Burger ever at one stall, and the Drunken Cheeses are worth a visit on their own.||March 16, 2015
rcook5699||50||my advise if you are staying in london, dont have breakfast. go to the market and eat some great food freshly prepared. Amazing||March 15, 2015
leisa_down_under||50||Excellent market.We arrived at 10am Saturday morning before the rush and stayed 2 hours - it was very busy when we left.Great stalls. Lots of choice and different things to see. Recommend||March 15, 2015

1Waldopeep||40||The variety of foods available is terrific! Most of the vendors were very friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed the cheese sandwiches even though the line was long. Plan to return on our next trip to London!||March 14, 2015
WMIM||40||There has been a market in this area probably for over one thousand years ago now, the first one being at the end of the then London Bridge.The current market is located to the immediate South of Southwark Cathedral but the tourist/traveller should beware as you are not really seeing an authentic historic London retail market but somewhere that has mainly developed only in the last couple of decades to cater mainly for the 'foodies' among us. It was mainly just the wholesale market until then.What's on offer here is a wonderful selection of different foods from around the world, both in the general market area and in some of the small, busy streets around. There is always plenty of 'street food' on sale and I think you could grow fat here just from availing yourselves of the many free samples.The market has been under threat in the past from the growing railway infrastructure, and trains above rumble over the viaducts at regular intervals.One of the nicest buildings is part of the old Floral Hall which once stood alongside the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden.Be aware that the retail market only operates from Wednesday to Saturday, and Saturdays can become unbearably overcrowded.||March 14, 2015
FoodieTraveller1028||50||As a Londoner I am so proud that we have such an amazing place on our doorstep. Food from far and wide. Great quality of all that you can wish for. My personal favourites are the Khanom Krok (Thai coconut pancake) stand (They are bite size of pure delight) and cheese sampling with a glass of red wine! Get there a little early (around 10-11am) to avoid the crowds. You will get to enjoy the market at your leisure (preferably with a glass of Proseco ;0)||March 14, 2015
Ian J||50||Borough market is very close to London bridge station and London bridge its self, out of the tube station and its across the road. From the moment you enter this great London market you will be amazed by the stalls selling all kinds of every thing really but the best is the food and what great food all kinds of food from around the world, go for breakfast go for lunch just go and taste all this great food it really is so great. Th stall holders are great to cheerful funny and kind and most of the food stalls give you a sample, so what are you waiting for get yourself there right now.||March 14, 2015
tog1964||20||Well over rated it is basically overpriced food for food snobs. Far better (and cleaner) delis, shops and food places in London.||March 13, 2015
Simon B||40||Stumbled upon this market whilst on the way to Guy's Hospital. You really could spend all day here sampling the delights. I am a particular fan of cheese and there was a huge selection but then there are the dried meats, the oils, the fish, the oysters, the spices, the baklava, the cakes, the breads, the sweets, the hams, the beers, the veggies, more cheese and even more cheese.||March 13, 2015
New_Speranza||50||We were on our way to the globe... but never made it. Instead we wondered and tasted our way through this maze of delicious foods from around the world for about an hour and plan to go back. It has something for everyone with a laidback no hassle atmosphere. It is worth going just for the smells.||March 13, 2015
marux23||50||Such a great market - I've been to a few in London but this is definitely one of my favourite (haven't been to the one in Brick Lane yet though!). They have a wide variety of food (not as much selection for vegetarians unfortunately). Prices are reasonable but not exactly cheap but its definitely worth a visit. Tip: Get there early on a Saturday because by around 12 it gets really crowded. We set out for around 10.30, ideal time in my opinion.||March 13, 2015
nomadlad||50||Borough Market has been and probably always will be my favourite place in London. I often visit here with friends, partner or on my own.The stalls are all great and the smells and aromas divine; from the fresh olives at one of the entrances to fruit and flowers deep inside.All reasonably priced and has a real London authentic feel. Great all times of year to visit.It can be tourist driven, but so what. It's a place for everyone to enjoy with so much choice for food and gifts and even just to have a look around.||March 12, 2015
LeMae32||50||We thought this was great. A foodies heaven. Lots and lots of choice with a great atmosphere. Probably wasn't cheap but my chicken wrap was heaven. Would highly recommend visiting this.||March 12, 2015
Daniel B||50||I went there and it was very easy to be found next to the subway station, directly to the right you'll find a staircase in front of a pub, take this one and in 25m you are there. I was expecting that the market was open on Sunday, but it wasn't. ||March 11, 2015
Blobs1248||50||After visiting Borough Market, it's understandable why it's rated so highly. After getting a hard cider to walk around with, we found a variety of everything from spices to oils to mustards to spiced beef to other food. The selections are fantastic as are the surrounding pubs that serve cask ales. Make sure to go when you're hungry and you'll enjoy everything!||March 11, 2015
JOHN C||40||A fascinating market under the railway bridges and adjoining Southwark Cathedral which has mouth-watering displays of all types of food for sale - artisan breads, cheeses, fruit, fish, meat, vegetables, etc., etc. One stand specialises in hard-to-find spices from all over the world. There are numerous stalls and small cafes selling delicious street food from Europe, Asia and the Far East. The justly renowned and very popular public house "The Market Trader" is just outside the market and is an experience in itself with an incredible array of real ales and ciders. The well-known wine merchants Laithwaites have a large cellar under the railway arches nearby and this is well worth a look around. This whole area is a really pleasant place to spend an two or three hours.||March 11, 2015
ttugrad81||40||come hungry! great market that offers a variety of foods (cheeses, breads, meats, fruits, veggies!). there's something for everyone. bring extra napkins and a drink for a more enjoyable experience. had the most amazing strawberry cheesecake.||March 11, 2015
Carlos D||50||great market, great products, a lot of diferent stores and places to eat, variety at is best, loved the market will be back.||March 10, 2015
default91852018||40||We didn't plan to visit this market. While wondering around the area, we stumbled upon this gorgeous food market. Even if you are not hungry, it is difficult resisting the yummy food produce being sold here. Definately worth a visit... come on an empty stomach as there is a wonderful variety of gourmet cooked street food.... enjoy!||March 10, 2015
Nick S||40||Amazing. Really packed with lots of people going there. The reason is that there are amazing market stalls. Brilliant food of all kinds from all over the world. Bit pricey but you will find food which is not available from your average supermarket.It is a foodies heaven.||March 10, 2015
ShelleyOC88||50||Borough Market has a life of its own. The atomsphere, people and food are so good. I try to have a wander down here in my lunch breaks and am always spoilt for choice with the selection of food.Highly recommend all to at least experience borough market on market day at least once!||March 10, 2015
316DavidS316||50||Get train to Blackfirars and then wLk along the South Bank, take in the Tate, the Globe Theatre and the Golden Hind before you get to the Market. Brilliant atmosphere, great range of foods from a variety or countries, great produce from cheese, to pastries, to meats to ales and so vibrant- the colours are brilliant and great for photographers. All around are the pubs and restaurants if you do not want finger food and you could try the proper breakfast if you are lucky to get to the London cafe. And if that is not enough for you you are also in walking distance of the Shard. I have been a regular visited for a while now and the place never ceases to lack. Compact and attractive.||March 10, 2015
Richard R||40||Excellent food, try the cheese cake.. Take your own drink and napkins. Many different types of cheeses and bread.. ||March 10, 2015
EricChin||50||I love food, and I love weekend markets. If you're like me then this market simply cannot, and should not be left off your itinerary if you're ever in London.There's a HUGE variety of food vendors and quaint stores selling things as diverse as antiques to cheeses to skincare products, and I reckon you'd easily spend half your Sunday just wandering the nooks & crannies of this market.Do not miss the incredible roast pork belly sandwich at Roast, the amazing cheeses at Neal's Yard and the utterly delicious pastries on offer at the market. If you're lucky, you'll run into two blokes selling Turkish Boreks - cheese stuffed filo pastries - that is comfort food at its warm, crispy, cheesy best!"Free From Bakehouse" also has a stall here, and they sell a variety of gluten-free and sugar-free cakes and desserts, which are all definitely worth a try. Had one of their moist dark chocolate cake slices when I was last there and I was simply blown away that the cake had no refined sugars in it!The only downside of Borough Market, I reckon, is that there's just too much food to try out there! So come hungry, and thank whomever it was who was brilliant enough to invent the elastic waistband!||March 8, 2015
Smidahar||40||My first time to Borough Market and whilst it was smaller than I expected, it was great. I got some fresh items like honey to take home and bought several different food items to try for lunch. Lots of choice for vegetarians which makes a change. I didn't know what to try first. I would definitely go back. ||March 8, 2015
NinaTom||50||We have been here several times now and it is still a great place to visit. It is touristy, busy and probably a bit pricier than if you want to get the number 214 to the back end of London, but there you go. Lots of foods to try and a few good places to grab a refreshing drink. Best combined with a stroll along the river. ||March 8, 2015
StevePugh001||40||Great range of food. Had a superb veggie haloumi burger. The place and surrounding areas were absolutely rammed - reminiscent of a peak hour tube journey. But a great atmosphere nevertheless!||March 8, 2015
LikesBooksWi||50||If you are a food lover, don't miss Borough Market. Best market I've been to in any country. Go hungry. Stay all day. Have fun. Highlight of my recent visit to London was Borough Market. I can't wait to go back.Just GO.||March 8, 2015
darthteddy||50||Bright sunny day and finally decided to visit the Borough market and it was fantastic. Awesome food stalls, great fresh produce and a number of pubs and restaurants around for a drink. The fruits and vegetables were so fresh and so were the meats. Highlight of the day was a lovely garlic prawn wrap which was absolutely delicious. Go early if you want to do some grocery shopping before the crowds get in. Once they do the humanity is crazy. Great afternoon out and will visit much more frequently now.||March 8, 2015
924MichelleO||50||I've been to Borough market many times and it never gets old. The minute you're in you're eyes and nose go into sensory overdrive and you forget where you are. The market has amazing food, fresh food to go and good to buy, everything from fruit and veg, ostrich, octopus, cider and fudge. If I lived in London I would probably be there every week and my kitchen cupboards would be full of home made delights. It's a hidden gem but once you know it's there you won't be able to resist going back! ||March 7, 2015
rosie7242||50||We stumbled across these markets after walking across the London Bridge. The markets are predominantly food markets with a lot of fresh produce, cheese, continental items and ready to eat meals from a number of different nationalities. I can only describe the markets as a food lovers delight. We loved it here and will return.||March 7, 2015
1AnnieEliza||30||We walked through the market to check it out and of course get some food. It was OK, but not as extensive as I expected it to be, based on all the guide books, websites and reviews that say otherwise. Hubby got a port scratchings meal from Roast Hog, he was happy with it. I had a scotch egg with sweet potato fries that was very nice. I do wish they would ban the use of cameras of any kind while people are in line. I saw lots of lines moving very slowly because people were trying to line up a perfect shot of their food at the exact moment of purchase. Extremely annoying! Not to mention that the photos are in my opinion, useless, if once you take it you then alter it to look "more perfect"??? Maybe I would have enjoyed the market more if people hadn't been slowing everything down to take pictures of their food.||March 7, 2015
fizzles||50||Got here quite early and there were no crowds and had a good wander around, had a lovely hot apple and ginger drink, yum!. Was too early to eat lunch so left the markets to go for a bit of a walk and when we came back there was a huge crowd. Did not let this put me off, bought a mulled wine and wandered around again and bought some of the lovely produce to take home. Bought some fruit, cheese, bread and olives. For lunch I had an ethiopian dish which was very flavoursome and good value. Would definately recommend this market to others, easy to get there from London Bridge tube station.||March 7, 2015
PaulT_13||40||We visited the market and had lunch while we were walking around! I had a bab with chorizo and rocket which was fabulous. The wide variety of quality produce was astounding.Please see for yourself! ||March 7, 2015
jenw206||50||This was a lovely trip though a fantastic market, filled with all kinds of things to try and to buy. The cheeses were great purchases, as was the spice shop selling small packages of spices and various peppercorns. Most vendors are willing to give samples or talk about their product, as long as they are not helping others, or have a long queue waiting. The side streets also have great places to stop, the Vinotopia wine shop is definitely worth a look. I was here on a January Friday slightly off hours, and it was still packed, so I can't imagine a sunny Saturday - it will be wall-to-wall people. If you don't mind crowds, it is worth it, and I'd say try anything you think looks good.||March 6, 2015
alex_povereny||40||It's a nice place to go around to grab something to eat. Good variety of food stalls. You will find soups, sweets, vegi food, ice cream and more||March 6, 2015
SydneyGodett20||50||Borough Market is without a doubt the best place to get lunch, groceries, or snacks. There is every type of cuisine you could imagine ranging from vegetarian Indian to classic BBQ. The cheese section of this market is the biggest I've ever seen; the only suggestion I would make is to not fill up on all the samples. You could spend hours wandering between food stalls, and I suggest you do! There are tons of great vendors and you can't make a bad choice on what to eat. The produce is super fresh and if you stick around until the market is shutting down you may be able to strike a great deal on fruits and veggies. Go on a Saturday, it's busy but it's when all the vendors are there.||March 6, 2015
mabel98||50||You need to be hungry when you visit as there is so much to try here. Fabulous cheeses, condiments, olives, charcuterie and fudge were amongst our purchases and a great choice of street food to eat on the spot for lunch. Also allow time to walk around the shops in the streets around the market which also sell good quality produce. A great break from seeing the classic sights north of the river||March 5, 2015
kendstar||50||Such an amazing markets with soooo many delicious looking things. I could have eaten there for hours if it wasn't for the high prices.Don't miss out on this market, just make sure to choose your food wisely since there is lots of it and it does add up on your wallet||March 5, 2015
Princess_Pretty||50||I was told by my mum to check out Borough Market as my husband is a bit of a foodie. Although we didn't eat anything from the market (as we went to Feng Sushi which is just outside the market) we were very tempted.I loved the fact that we could buy a plastic glass of prosecco for £3 each and walk around all the stalls with it. There is something for everyone here. Meat, beer, wine, cheese, fish as well as a Spanish and French store within the market.The food looked and smelt amazing, to the point that the next time we are in London we will try something, whether it's a pulled pork sandwich or paella.I can't wait to return.||March 4, 2015
lisa h||40||Great collection of food vendors. Though expensive, most are purveying quality food. Cheese vendors are in abundance, as are bakers and deli type stalls. A few noteworthy stalls are the raclette cheese, Italian specialty pasta, and bread factory.I was impressed with the quality of the foods, but some of the dishes were so exposed I would not dare try them. Still, there are many options and certainly something to satisfy the most finicky palette. I went on Saturday which is very crowded. Next time I'll go during the week||March 4, 2015
pinheirod78||50||The Market is an amazing place in the heart of London City (London Bridge tube station). Plenty of options to eat (go for the cheese racklette or the three cheese toastie on the Kappacasein`s) and take a pleasant walk through the local product stands. Don't miss the streets on the surroundings (like Park St), they are full of cheese caves or little stores. Give priority to Thursday to Sunday's visit, when the market is fully operational.||March 4, 2015
Diane B||50||Can't believe I didn't know about this market, it is amazing. Fruit, veg, fish, sweets, cheese you name it they have it. Fresh food being cooked, music playing, good old fashioned east end. Should be on top of everyones "must see" list.||March 4, 2015
313duncang||50||During our day out we visited the Borough Market.This is a must visit market if you love food. Not cheap but that said for quality food you don't mind paying the money, that said its not all expensive.From veg to fresh fish, cheese, to wine and olives they have it all! The cheese and bread stalls scored highly and most stall have samples for you to taste. A one stop shop for some special food.||March 4, 2015
Bella S||50||I am not usually the one in favor of "street food", meaning my idea of "eating out" involves a decent venue with centre pieces and cutlery on the tables. Therefore, the idea of visiting a marketplace that sells food and eating there is not usually high on my "things to do" lists, when travelling. Borough market changed all that. From the sheer variety of produce on sale, to the fab setting (the walk along the river to reach it is quite something in its own right), it is a sight not to be missed. The venue is home to many street food vendors of various cuisines and dietary habits but it also has a fair amount of restaurants around, if you prefer to sit down. It also provides for ample people watching and photo opportunities, if you are not hungry (but you would be seriously missing out).||March 4, 2015
Cindy B||50||It has taken me 64 years to visit this wonderful friendly indoor food market and it has so much more!!We had a wonderful morning trying the fantastic food and buying loads,It's a must on a visiting list!!and we will be back.||March 3, 2015
hull_jolly_2||50||Being from 'up north' we don't get markets like this. We have visited several times and have always enjoyed it...hence our return. It is relaxing to wander around the food stalls, occasionally buying snacks. There is always a good range of take away foods as well as bread, cakes and cheeses. There is a great beer stall which sells unusual beers as well as serving sparkling wine in plastic flute glasses to drink as you wander. Would recommend.||March 3, 2015
Willett||40||It busy, but worth going and trying the free samples before you purchase your lunch. Interesting area.||March 3, 2015
lorak501||50||I loved Borough Market. I found it on Trip Advisor when I was planning my London trip and when I saw it was a food market I knew I just had to visit it. I went on a Monday during lunch time and I was happy I did. There is such a variety of different foods on offer and they are very normally priced - I was struggling to make a choice! They have stalls of everything - from food from around the world to pastries, cakes, coffee, smoothies etc. If you're around that part of London stop by for lunch or dinner (or just a dessert) - it's worth it!||March 3, 2015
joan t||30||We first visited this market some years ago, before the TV hype. At that time, Gregg Wallace was serving on one of the fruit stalls and the produce and stalls were worth visiting. We returned in january, and it was raining and dank, but a lot of the stalls were closed and the others were very overpriced. We didn't eat at the street food stalls but they were busy. Nice architecture and worth visiting if in the area but i do think it has gone downhill.||March 3, 2015
MSItalyUk||30||Food is pretty good and no as expensive as I thought, but buying groceries here is a rip-off.Try the Boston burgers, they are really good||March 2, 2015
ChristineTTang||50||Too much history in old London? Here's the place you can enjoy some other tastes of London! This place is energetic and full of fun discoveries. You can have a taste of cheese, a bite of textured bread, flavored jam and various kinds of street food, all at one place! A place deserves second visit! ||March 2, 2015
martine0211||40||When going to London Borough market is often on my list of to do's. You can buy the best food there. And you have a lot of specialised businesses.||March 1, 2015
davethesuede||40||I live 'up North' but was in Southwark on business. Had a wander round Borough Market. Some of us ate Sausage baps, I had Egyptian (first time in my life).Very tasty, and cheap. Up North we think expensive street food vendors are charging London prices, when it's actually cheaper in the Capital.Highly recommended.||March 1, 2015
Elmo1989_03||50||We had our lunch here there was so much to choose from. Everyone is willing to give you free samples too which is good! We had a curry from the Vegetarian Indian stand as well as some cheese and prosecco. We spent a good 2 hours here there is so much to see and it's a great location right near London Bridge tube and has a great view of The Shard. ||February 28, 2015
weemick||50||Just along from the Shard a fantastic food market with fresh produce from local producers and abroad. Loads of food and drinks to sample in a great atmosphere off the London embankment.||February 28, 2015
Coasted||50||We had a delicious takeaway from the Gourmet Coat, on the corner by Southwark Cathedral. We chose them because of the care & attention the chefs were giving to their food & customers. We were glad we did!Borough market is best during lunch time as so many bustling stalls. It is definitely worth a trip (next to London Bridge tube) but I recommend checking the opening days & times, as sometimes is deserted / closed.||February 28, 2015
Flutey90||50||A lot more than I was expecting there to be! I loved the variety of food and cultures at this market, particularly the lunchtime foods available. Fairly reasonably priced and really interesting to wader round. Will definitely be returning!||February 28, 2015
Kevin H||50||This is a must visit market if you love food. Generally speaking it's not cheap, but the quality of the produce is superb. From veg to fresh fish, cheese, to wine and olives they have it all! The cheese stalls are my favourite, most vendors providing a taste to help you make up your mind. There are spice and herb stalls and wine merchants along with butchers and bakers. A one stop shop for a special meal for that special person.||February 28, 2015
Mauilove39||50||Amazing food - so much variety it is hard to choose!Some of my favorite places are Pie Minister, Cannon and Cannon, Pate moi and Jumi Cheese!What a great place to eat and shop for produce, cheese, sausage, pate and much more!Love this place!||February 27, 2015
LJBCarmarthenshire||40||This food hall full of fresh fruit and veg plus jams cheeses etc is worth a visit. Expensive yes. But fresher food you cannot find and if like us your willing to try anything there is plenty of exotic things I have never seen before let alone eaten.||February 27, 2015
Keith J||50||Endless choice of food stalls, too yummy to imagine. Lots of lunchtime snacks. My personal favourite is the duck confit baguette (from Le Marche du Quartier). Also plenty of artisan and specialist food shops||February 27, 2015
Nitro-Nik||50||Great for a variety of fresh food for lunch. Including great fish and chips. Food can be taken to the park of a church right next door. Not cheap||February 27, 2015
helenahankaart||50||On a drizzly day with a hangover a trip to Borough Market is a great way to restore body and soul. This is a proper working market, small but with a great selection of food and produce.||February 27, 2015
Tony M||40||Wide range of delicious food, but rather overpriced compared to other street food locations, e. g. Camden Lock and White Cross Street ||February 26, 2015
90TheaB||50||Borough Markets is located a stones throw away from the London Bridge Tube Stop on Southwark Street. I ventured there on a Thursday around 2pm and found the array of fresh produce on offer to be overwhelming. My suggestion is to go on an empty stomach and do a lap or two around the market checking out what they have on offer. The markets is foodie heaven, from fresh organic fruit and veg to baked goods, french pastries, seafood, meat, wine, juice, chocolates, health foods (gluten free) and cheese...so much cheese! Warm spiced cider and mulled wine will alleviate the winter chill. I had a large container of thai green chicken seafood curry for £6 and a chocolate brownie for £2 as well as a couple sage and pork sausages to take home for dinner for 85p each. Something for everyone; don't miss it if visiting London.||February 26, 2015
roobozzart||30||Dropped by the Borough Market when it was 10 degrees F. in London, thinking that the Market would be a warren of warm winter-resistant restaurants and curios. Wrong! It's very much a working hub and not really a tourist attraction per se, but it might have been more fun if I'd been smarter and waited till Spring to visit.||February 26, 2015
kathfirth||50||We called here today. What a great place. There were a lot of different food stalls from fish to artisan bread. We had a salt beef sandwich on rye bread with pickle and mustard. We bought one to share. It was delicious and at £6.50 very reasonable as it was full of filling. We also had a lemonade, that too was really good. This is a great place to wander round, the place smells Devine.||February 25, 2015
Hannahpianaa||50||When in London, I make sure I visit the market for a bite. Unfortunately for my waistline, the bite turns into several bites every time.Okay the crowds can make it somewhat uncomfortable at peak times but if you arrive an hour before the lunch rush it is bearable and you can take your food to the church yard to sit. What I love the most is the variations and choice of food; chorizo to ostrich burgers, fresh paella to salt beef, biscotti to oysters.If you are a foodie make sure you wear stretchy pants!||February 25, 2015
rachmi||50||If you're a foodie then you have to visit this market in London! The smells, tastes and sights are wonderful. After looking around all the tasty food i settled on a pork bap from a spit roasted pig and it was soo good!There's a huge variety from cakes and breads, to cheeses, to meat and also vegetarian!It's a must if you love your food and the prices weren't too bad either.||February 25, 2015
DDL318||40||Borough Market is famously great for food and hipster-spotting. Generally one part does take away 'street' food, the other side is more market like (although there is plenty of cross-over). It's great, the kids liked trying all the different breads, cheeses and cured meats tasters, along with the delicious fish risotto. We ate burgers, Egyptian vegetarian stuff (?), Boston sausages, and some pretty good coffee (although not the best in town). Only tip is to go before lunch to the non-takeaway side, as many of the stall holders had already shut up shop by 2pm.||February 25, 2015
housefrau365||50||My husband and I spent a lovely afternoon at the market. We both had a very nice lunch for less than 5GBP each. There were a huge variety of vendors to suit every type of food preference. It was very crowded but we were there on Saturday so it's not very surprising. It would be better to go during the week.||February 25, 2015
roseanneellen||40||Having lived in London for a while now, this is my go-to market whenever I want some delicious food. Perfect for all ages.Best to go on weekdays when there is a full market as on the weekend and during half term it can get ridiculously busy.||February 24, 2015
Gary T||40||This is a great place to visit and browse for a few hours. The food is just great and lots of knick knacks to interest you.Food samples are many and wine tasting here and there.Just take a trip and enjoy.||February 23, 2015
Nick D||40||Huge variety of stalls, from fishmongers, cheese, butchers, bakers through to china and just about any and every type of street/fast food you can imagine. Great place to wander around.||February 23, 2015
Janelle T||50||I love this market. I have to keep myself from going everyday. Being from Los Angeles it is hard to find some of the things I love from home like quality Mexican food products, etc. but here I usually find what I need and more than I was looking for. I always get my bacon and eggs here, there is a wild meat stall that sells a variety of choices from kangaroo to Bison (I'm going back for the Bison). There are a few cheese stalls and Neals Yard all offering a decent range of fromage from all over Europe. The best times to go are mornings Wednesday-Saturday, although some sellers aren't there everyday. The market does have a lunch period mon-fri as well where all or most of the food vendors are serving the locals. If you are living here like me then go in the mornings so you can get in before the hoards of tourists, if you are a tourist then go on the weekends when its buzzing and enjoy the experience!||February 23, 2015
Patricia M||40||I was in London so decided to pay a visit to Borough market. It was very busy but as it is only open Friday and Saturday it is understandable. There are many stalls with an abundance of unusual vegetables, variety of cheeses, oils, wine, and pasties all displayed beautifully. The aroma of the freshly cooked Asian, Chinese and vegetarian food is wonderful plus great coffee. A great few hours spent on a dull day.||February 22, 2015
Monika M||50||Amazing variety of fast food stalls - we had the "Mothership" meal from Pieminister: a pie of your choice (the "matador" and the "deerstalker" are both excellent), mash potato, mushy peas and gravy.We visited on Saturday, so the place was very busy.||February 22, 2015
E H||30||I have heard so much about Borough Market that i had massive expectations.The best way to describe the market is that it is a town's farmers market but on a bigger scale.There are many fantastic foods to sample and I really enjoyed it. I just think my expectations where to high. If you love food and have a few hours to kill it is worth a visit, but don't come to London just for the market.I would rate this more than average but less than very good.||February 21, 2015
FinnFitz||50||I took young Barnaby to see the market where I used to go when at Godson's Brewery, the Globe pub is still there but it was not open as it used to be during the day. What can I say, We used to go to Fish and it is still there, the market has a plethora of food stores and cheese stalls and cafes and restaurants, the atmosphere is amazing, the buzz and crowds, just like the market used to be just with people wearing more expensive clothes. We started off at Brindisa, having breakfast in our favourite Spanish cafe. Later. we could not resist a salt beef sandwich with a wally, salt beef sandwiches without a gherkin are not the real deal, but Barnaby was resistant so I ate his. It took me back to the East End. This is the best market in London that anyone can access without a special pass or tour. It's vibrant and fun and has something for everyone. I buy my meat from a shop opposite Smithfield but the food stalls and butchers here look great. Barnaby loved his slice of contemporary London and he thought the salt beef sandwich was delicious, too. When Michael Fitzalan was planning his best selling book, Remember the Fifth of November, he took us to Brindisi and up to The View at the Shard. It was a summer's day and Brindisa Borough Market was bathed in sunshine, the lunch was superb, sherry and tapas, then we went up the Shard to view London. We bought and took home some cheese from one stall and some salami from another. I am determined to work my way around all the eateries and end up at Fish, which we went to about two years ago. Wish me luck, it may take me twenty years to do it, but the variety and quality of food will sustain me! This place is the ideal first call on a day in London, or for lunch or for supper, or for an eleven o' clock salt beef sandwich form the sandwich stall underneath the arches, but don't forget the wally!||February 20, 2015
ShirleyE14||40||Lots a different food stalls, selling street food to eat on the go, as well as meat, fruit and veg and cakes. Loads of choice, and lots of great advise form the stall holders. A lovely atmosphere that is buzzing. Well worth a visit.||February 20, 2015
Tom D||50||Stay in Borough Market for the day or just grab a bite and go, either way Borough Market is a great stop. Tons of wonderful food options - quick bites and groceries. Our group spent about £25 all together and we tried food from at least five or six different vendors. Everything was great. Despite how expensive London can be it is easy to find a great lunch here for £5 - £6. Just head for the Shard if you are on foot and need a visual, or the London Bridge Underground/train stop.||February 19, 2015
dcb007||50||Every time we go to London, we visit this market in the Southwark area of London. There are tons of eating stalls and fruit/veg, meat, seafood, cheese and bakery places to choose from, including a stall that sells cider! I believe it's closed on Sunday's but it's definitely bustling on Fridays and Saturdays.||February 19, 2015
penny t||50||I had heard great reviews of Borough Market but never thought it was worth traveling to (easy to find now at the bottom of shard), how wrong was I ! I have traveled a good part of the world but saw more varieties of food, both exotic and just plain gorgeous tasting in 5 hours of walking this market. It is a treasure-trove of wonderful surprises for tastes, looks, smells and best of all for exceptional gifts that your friends would never expect to receive. I can't wait to get back again with an empty suitcase and an appetite.||February 19, 2015
Paul59cdo||40||My girlfriend and I have visited here a few times and every time we go we have a great time. There are so many places to eat and buy food and veg, also alcohol. This market is year old and has a lot of history around it and so the visit to the market turns into a local visit of many attractions. I would definitely recommend visiting here but wear comfy shoes because you do end up walking all over to everything else thats local.||February 19, 2015
Fernetdan||50||It was the Saturday before Christmas and I was meeting the girlfriend's family for the first time. I thought I would take them to Borough as it is one of my must do's when in London.It was the first time I had been back since construction finished and it was better than I remembered. Yes it was shoulder to shoulder with other punters, and the queue to Monmouth coffee was 100 deep; but it felt like Christmas. The Brussel Sprouts still on their stalks, the Mistletoe, and Christmas Mince pies. The pork pies were delicious as were the several mulled wines. I would recommend not going on a Saturday and making sure that you do a complete lap before you decide on your lunch as a food envy is a dangerous thing||February 18, 2015
Mitzimoo100||50||Even if your not staying in the vicinity, you have to visit Borough Market. It's known for being londons oldest food market, great place and you can spend time taking in the he sights and smell, and even tasting what's on offer. We stayed at the London Bridge Hotel which is literally across the road! A perfect area to stay in. There are chic wine bars around even a Pop Up champagne bar which you can eat oysters too!!!||February 18, 2015
SarahJupiter||40||We stumbled on this walking around the south bank. We waited in a queue for an amazing homemade burger that was really really tasty. Typical market. You could buy cheese, fish, fruit etc but you can also have lunch there. Lots of fresh fruit juice stalls too. The only thing wrong with it, was that it was absolutely packed and it was actually difficult to walk around some areas without feeling you were in the Tokyo metro.||February 18, 2015
Paul S||40||If on the Southbank or the City then pop over to the Market, its close to London Bridge so easy to reach. Its worth a trip, its not just your standard market, this is a artisan foodie place. Lots of stalls, lots of great food to eat and sample and always busy. Take your bags as you will be buying something it all looks so delicious.One thing though, it isn't cheap. This is prime hipster country and it charges accordingly so be ready for that £12 loaf of bread!||February 18, 2015
Ruth K||40||We went on Saturday morning, crappy weather, cold and rainning and still it was unbelievably crowded! The food stalls are great, we had bureka, a cheese pie made with sfogliatta and it was delicious! We walked quite a bit and then we tried to find a place to sit, but it was impossible so crowded it was. Moreover, there were no places in any of the restaurants and pubs around it as well. So we decided to cross the London bridge, and had lunch on the other side. Since I am spending a few months here, I am planning to go back on a Thursday, hoping that it will be less crowded! But I do recommend it!||February 17, 2015
moiraw273||40||After a visit to the Shard today, we went across to the Borough Market. I had an amazing falafel wrap but it was difgicult to choose - all the stall food looked good. So if you want something quick and tasty after the Shard.......this is the place.||February 17, 2015
crazybutlush||50||Amazing aray of all things food - definitely somewhere to go if you are a foodie and great surroundings too! ||February 16, 2015
568irenem||50||My husband took me here as a surprise, and WHAT a surprise. It's fabulous! We went to Marias Café for a bubble and squeak breakfast. Very good value and plenty to choose from. Then we walked around the market, twice, because I didn't want to miss anything. There are so many different foods to try I simply cannot list them all. I bought fabulous Caerphilly cheese (from Somerset), wonderful sausages from Northfield Farm Butchers, Nutmeg syrup from a stall selling produce from Grenada and I have to mention the amazing stall that sells just about every sort of liquorice I have ever heard of and more. So there is cheese and dairy, fruit and veg, spices, meat, cuisine from around the world, breads, cakes, kitchen goodies, truffles etc etc etc . If I lived near-by I would probably never have to cook again. We went on a Saturday morning and it was getting pretty busy by the time we left, but hey, that's just part of the atmosphere.||February 16, 2015
tp19862011||40||I visited Borough Market a little while before christmas, it was a Saturday but we got there about 10.30am so it wasn't massively busy. It's a good place to browse and there is a wide variety of food to sell (unfortunately I couldn't buy much because I had to walk around London for the rest of the day). There are lot's of samples on offer and some of the things that I tried were delicious. I would definitely go back when I am in a better position to shop.||February 16, 2015
teresajaned||40||While in London we visited Borough Market, it was an amazing market full of all different types of food, cheese, fruit & vegetables. Don't have lunch before you go as so many samples to try, something different to experience, I would recommend you give it a try.||February 16, 2015
uukearv||50||We went to the market on a Friday morning, at 10am, It was quiet and clean with only a few visitors. We could taste many things and walk around easily about 1 hr. At 11am the place became very very crowded. The places that sale food or drinks were full with people. Although we waited in a long line, We bought a very tasty German "brotvursht" (like Hot Dog but much more better) and enjoyed every bite. Hot Apricot sider on that cold day was worming. If in the area - it's worth the visit.||February 15, 2015
KKgirl93||40||This was about the third time I visited, but the last time I came was nearly 2 years ago. I think it has changed a bit since then! It is definitely way more 'touristy', or maybe it has always been like that but I felt it even more because I went on a Saturday. Word of caution - if you don't like crowds, then doing on Saturday is not the best time for you! If you quite like the buzzing atmosphere and queues, then it's still a great place. Amazing selection of food and drink as expected - tons of cheeses, bread, chutneys, meat, fruit juice, vegetables and everything in between! For a foodie like me, it was overwhelming and I got excited at every stall. Hahahaha. As i mentioned, it's just the crowds that made things a bit complicated because it got quite hard to navigate around sometimes! I must admit though, prices aren't the best - maybe because it has become so popular with tourists that they can afford to jack up their prices. A small brownie or piece of bread easily costs £2, which may sound not too bad but considering that it's just a stall out in the open, some might hesitate to pay this price.Nevertheless, take your time exploring and sampling the food - it's a great place to spend an hour or two just admiring the huge array of food! Check out the surrounding cafes too - I've heard a lot of positive things about them as well!||February 15, 2015
Graeme W||50||If your a foodies, this is the place to go in London. what an experience, can't wait to go back there. Make sure you go on an empty stomach & have a pocket full of change & small notes. If you find the stall selling "duck confit sandwiches & mulled wine" then you have found heaven!A definite must when in London!||February 15, 2015
Cas194||50||We discovered this foodie paradise en route to vinopolis and can't wait to devote a day to visiting the place properly, a veritable haven of all things gastronomicApparently it's also the oldest fruit and vegetable market in London ... Nuff said ... Go ... Explore!!||February 15, 2015
CharlieFang||40||What a place with all sort of fresh vegetables, cheeses, meat and above all lovely fast food made with delicate fresh ingredients and drinks. You can get food to fill your stomach and drink to quench your thirst.... A must visit for first time London visitors!!||February 15, 2015
Yara Z||50||So much amazing food here, lots of it changes! Go hungry and give them all a try!!La tua pasta is AMAZING. Best pasta ever, so fresh, so fun! They also do deliveries within certain zones, so be sure to check them out!!||February 15, 2015
pearl2106||40||This was a lovely location for a Valentine's afternoon. Loads to choose from and something for every taste. We had a great lunch and some bits to take home too all at a good price. ||February 15, 2015
AnaRitaAzevedo||40||A great place to eat where you can find vegetarian meals of excellent quality! And the stands with desserts ... fancy eating everything! Furthermore it has bread stands, cheeses, vegetables, teas, ciders and beers, fudge ...||February 14, 2015
Traveladdictuk76||50||Even arriving at 10am, this place is packed. It has some amazing food you just do not know where to start. Well worth a visit ! Highly Recomended !||February 14, 2015
Dinosauraus||40||I loved it here! Make sure you try the mushroom Pate'! Well actually, make sure you try all the things.Its fresh, its got great Atmosphere, and its packed.||February 13, 2015
Gillian T||50||brilliant - just a great place for atmosphere and 'heritage'. All food stall holders had made real effort to display wares - sadly had just had large brekkie and heading for pre booked lunch so didn't try any - but looked amazing||February 13, 2015
Michaeldoc||40||Whatever you need, you will find it in this colorful covered market... From kangaroo burger to pheasant, Spanish ham, Gorgonzola cheese all at affordable prices....||February 13, 2015
frankie57||50||So good to find a market that provides so well for gluten free. Fresh produce, cakes and hot food to chose from. Love the cheeses, will be back.||February 13, 2015
antigonakee||50||Borough market is the best food market. You can find an extensive variety of (but not limited to) italian, greek, french cheese and general dairy traders, meat, charcuterie, fish and seafood, fruit and fresh produce, spices, condiments, gourmet products and of course plenty of bakers. There is also an extensive variety of small cafes, bars and restaurants or food stalls. As it is really close to the Thames you can always combine it with a nice stroll through the small pebble paths to Shakespeare's Globe, Tate Museum, Millennium bridge and St. Paul's Cathedral.||February 13, 2015
sprollylane||50||Not open fully on Sunday, limited stalls in the week. Saturday, be prepared! Very busy!! Still great day out and so near to so many historic London landmarks. Modern London at its best.||February 12, 2015
FranXav||30||Lots of old stuff to see and easy access. Loads of eataries and cafes. Items here are affordable. You could keep strolling and it takes you to many places.||February 12, 2015
CathyC119||50||Had always wanted to visit this centuries old market but was told by a guide it wasn't open for trading on our required dates... Well we went anyway and wow!!! The different street venders, amazing food stalls... The selection of different type of gourmet foods is surely second to none... If your a foodie it's a must... Just make sure you go on an empty stomach..||February 12, 2015
Christine276||50||I love borough market. Where else can you walk around drinking proseco and trying all the lovely things they have to offer. The choice is huge, cheese, cured meats, breads, spices and much more. Great experience!||February 11, 2015
jerseyman1||50||Very enjoyable to wander round this fantastic selection of fresh food stalls and places selling hot takeaway food, the selection is enormous, ranging from Ethiopian through French, German and English. My wife had Cajun Chicken from one stall, I had a brilliant hot beef roll from Roast to Go. Best I have had, £6.50 and worth every penny. Some of the stalls are overpriced, but the selection of cheeses and artisan breads are fantastic. Will return whenever we are in area, it's a good place to pass an hour or two and find things you wouldn't come across easily elsewhere.||February 11, 2015
uvabrian||50||Even if you aren't a foodie, you should go to Borough Market. You will really discover amazing things produced by people who actually care about their products. The food options really are limitless. Before you go, bring several things. First bring water. Second, bring utensils, perhaps something more functional than any flimsy plastic fork etc. that you can pick up from the market vendors. Really, try cutting into a wedge of cheese with a plastic fork. Pack a few napkins or paper towels because things can get messy. Also you can wet one with your drinking water. Why? Because you may find that you want a piece of fruit or something that you need to wipe off before you eat it. Fourth bring an open mind. If the vendor isn't busy, definitely talk to them. They will talk your ear off telling you about their products. Also don't forget some of the shops on the side streets like Neal's Yard Dairy, Konditor & Cook, and Monmouth coffee for example.||February 10, 2015
Nick D||40||A well known market and recommended by my friends. I finally managed to get there and it was worth it.Good quality produce, cheese, meats, spices, breads, flowers, game, pies, olive oil, seafood, local and imported cured meats... So many great things to see, taste and buy. Great food options to sit down and eat or take away. Allow at least an hour or two and take a big bag to carry the shopping.||February 10, 2015
Nicnac2511||50||I loved this market - in fact you could eat a whole meal without paying for it - samples everywhere and they were delicious - loved the atmosphere and the fact that you could buy a complete dinner parties food without having to stray outside the market and cheaper than some supermarkets - visit and enjoy.......||February 9, 2015
PDC1604||50||A real experience with atmosphere like you never expect in a UK market. The sights, colours, aromas and flavours will intrigue with many stalls sampling their produce. Come at lunchtime and grab food to graze as you explore. Highly recommended, my son thought the best thing we did all day!||February 9, 2015
Stephanie8228||40||I would avoid going on a weekend, I went Saturday around 1pm and it was super packed. Also, be sure to bring cash with you to avoid long ATM lines! I had a delicious sandwich/giant cookie at the market and enjoyed wandering about the shops.||February 9, 2015
Einat-Shaked88||50||You can just walk around and enjoy looking at all the different food.. great things to eat and buy. everything was designed beautifully, I enjoyed just looking at it.. Don't miss||February 9, 2015
rlcogg27193||50||A great place to go and try new foods! I'd recommend going there on the last day of a trip to London, because it's impossible to go without buying cheese, brownies etc (like me). Will definitely go again.||February 9, 2015
Lobbi_G||50||I wish I stayed nearer, I would never shop in a supermarket again. This is how food shopping should be done! Free samples and good banter from the stalls all a plus.||February 9, 2015
Fabiana P||30||We went there last day to try this famous market and yes, is nice just for 30minutes, not more! Too much people, is like to be sardines in a can! You can't move and to buy food you have to wait for a long time (depend always from wich stand you choose). We spotted some rabbits hang up without been cover and refrigerated! It's not hygenic! We tasted the Spanish Paiella and was nice but a little bit expensive for the portion that they gave us.No toilets, all the products are expensive but, if you're looking even for Gluten Free products, you can find something at good price!||February 8, 2015
B S||40||First time to Borough Market and what an experience. So much food and variety it was an amazing experience, being able to try the foods was a pleasure, and tastes wow. Look forward to another visit. Only downside it was packed !||February 8, 2015
Hawaiian555||40||If the smells don't capture you the sight of food will. Borough Market is a lovely small food market with a gourmet touch. Come here on an empty stomach and enjoy. I wish my hotel room had a kitchen so I can cook it myself. In the USA you would never find these items. So it's a great place to discover new foods from around Europe. Borough Market is surrounded by a Green Market and stalls selling high end fashions. It's a covered market so it's a good place to be when it's raining. I've been to Brick Lane which also has a great food market, but it's more local, low end as well with the fashions, but bigger and can take a couple hours to wander through.||February 8, 2015
sara f||40||There is some really unusual food here, the fruit and veg are amazing, some of which I've never seen before! Its a little pricey, but its hard not to buy some goodies. The donuts are amazing, if you go you have to try one and the range of meats, cheese and bread is fantastic. The market is smaller than I thought and we had been around several times within the hour. Worth a visit.||February 7, 2015
Visylia T||50||For brunch or lunch, I think Borough Market has quite a selection of good food :DThere are so many to choose from, the pad thai that I had was delicious! In addition, for the beer lovers, watch our for Utobeer Cage there, wide selection of beers available ^^||February 6, 2015
Rennaise8||50||Lovely and warm even if it was cold outside.Beautiful products.I ate Indian food but can't remember the name and it wasn't written on the bags. At the end of the market near from deutsh sausages stand. Perfect Indian, so good !! ||February 5, 2015
Carole P||50||A wonderful find, somewhat by accident, when we were meeting a friend nearby! Attracted by a fantastic array of different food, with glorious smells, we strolled aimlessly through this extravagant market. This is definitely worth a visit; and if you tire, step into beautiful Southwark Cathedral, which is just on the edge of the market. Be sure to visit the market when you are hungry.||February 5, 2015
furnesssj||50||I love borough Market we walked there from the park plaza along the riverside. Nothing to dislike about the market as it great.||February 5, 2015
No1Scribbler||50||I love the great food, buzzy atmosphere, diverse stalls and fantastic choice on offer at this market! Highly recommended as a great attraction that's not only free but you can get some amazing food to take home as a souvenir! There are also great places to get lunch on the go or to sit and watch the world go by with a glass or two. I always go when I'm in town and always recommend it to others! Superb...||February 5, 2015
Johnsmith1959||40||I work very close to Borough Market and wander round most lunchtimes. Theres a great selection of food on offer and plenty of stalls selling a variety of produce including breads, cheese, fish, meat, vegetables etc. It is a little pricey and can get very busy though.||February 4, 2015
Paul L||40||Went here once at the weekend when there was not that much going on but during the week at lunch it is bustling with numerous places eat and experience some gourmet street food.||February 4, 2015
Peacys||50||Love food? Like food?Hate food? (are you crazy?)No matter how strong your passion, this amazing market is simply food heaven! You WILL find something (or many more than 1) to indulge in and enjoy.Don't race in too early though. Sample some cheese and jam, taste the different types of bread, explore all your options before you make your final choice. After the big feast, go for a shop and treat yourself to the dessert tasters and of course, indulge once more!Wow, wow, wow!!!||February 3, 2015
Sue T||50||We love Borough Market its just an amazing place to visit and feel the atmosphere especially on a Saturday morning! So on a recent visit to London we could not think of anything better to go there first thing Saturday morning after a superb concert Friday evening.The stalls offer an array of wonderful fish, meat, vegetables and differing goodies and it is very easy to spend 3/4 hours there sampling the goodies on offer and buying so much more!We just wish that we lived closer as this would be our choice of shopping venue but sadly we don't so we just have to make up for it when we visit London again!||February 2, 2015
Shanthi K||40||Just outside Londen Bridge station. Fresh foods and drinks from all over the globe. We were here at saturday around lunchtime. The place was crouded with tourists and locals. We have had a great vegan lentle and beans wrap for 5pounds we were full upto dinner.You can taste at alot of stalls and the people behind them are keen on telling you there product info.||February 2, 2015
Richard C||40||We came across this market as we were walking along the south bank of the Thames. It was very busy and set up for Christmas, with lots of food and art and craft type stalls. ||February 1, 2015
A TripAdvisor Member||50||It's rare to meet someone who visited Borough Market, and didn't enjoy the experience. Located just steps from London Bridge Tube, so easily accessible from the centre of the city, this is one of the oldest and best-known markets in London. We visited Saturday lunchtime, so the market was busy with a friendly mixture of tourists, and Londoners from every background. We started our visit at Spice Mountain, where we picked up some tubs of prepared curry powders (from a huge selection) and a bottle of delicious Pomegranite molasses. We then went about our mission to explore and try as many unfamiliar foods as possible. Next was a stall selling flavoured mustards, and a Croatian stall with delicious fig preserves. Artisan bread and cheeses are big here, and it takes real willpower not to walk away with a bag full of sourdough loaves, or a creation stuffed with olives and herbs. We discovered some delicious mushroom pate, and bought two tubs for £8, and washed-down the sample with some delicate white tea. Now it was time for lunch! We started with a box of mixed vegetable curries (perfectly spiced) from Gujurati Rasoi, shared under the arches whilst sheltering from the rain. We then discovered Gourmet Goat, and shared a Kid Goat Kofta, served with Tzatziki, heaps of herbs and fresh lemon juice. A gorgeous, melt-in-the-mouth treat. Still hungry (it was a cold winter day after all) we then sampled 36 month cheese, and salami with pistachios, before concluding lunch with a plate of Paella, topped with mussels and prawns. Borough Market is not all about gourmet food; there is fresh veg aplenty, including varieties you may find difficult to source elsewhere, such as fresh Galangal. Prices are generally relatively expensive. We picked-up some Thai Basil just before we left. We spent about 1.5 - 2 hours here on this visit; we could have happily lingered longer. If you love food, you really can't visit London without spending a little time here.||February 1, 2015
Bermondseytravels||40||I actually shop for food here as Im local so sometimes the tourist mobs get a little in the way but its still worth it. I cant get all my oils, fish, meat, spices, veg etc. Great quality, if slightly pricey. As a tourist come and hang out at the market, eat drink and be merry, then walk it off down the South Bank. My top tip though...go Friday morning when it's open and no one is there.||January 31, 2015
RImrie||50||If I lived near here I'd be broke and obese! What a foodie delight with something to tingle every taste buds. Take some cash and and indulge yourself: we had a three course meal on foot: empanadas, Indian thali and donuts to die for. The market is also mostly covered so not a problem if it's raining.||January 30, 2015
Jane H||50||We always make a visit to this market when we are spending time in London! The food choices are amazing as are the wonderful smells! Cheese from France, Sausage from Germany, teas from India...you name it you will find it! We gather it all for a feast in our hotel or apartment! ||January 29, 2015
Nermine E||50||This market is a very interesting place to visit, especially for food lovers. Its just a couple of stops from Marble Arch tube station. Though full of a lot of products, it is not very big, you can stroll the whole place in an hour. It's neat and clean and a pleasure to walk around.The products offered there are: fruits, viggies, meat, sea food, poultry, cheese, bakery, sweets, spices, wine ...etc plus a lot of ready made ethnic dishes.||January 27, 2015
Aimee H||50||My friend and I visited Borough Market mid December and it was a fantastic experience. We had an amazing rosemary seasoned hog roast ciabatta sandwich with hot apple sauce. I was in food heaven! It tasted divine! We then moved onto the desserts. I bought a white chocolate chip cookie that was bigger than the span of my hand and he bought a chocolate brownie. We shared and both tasted AMAZING! Definitely needs a visit, even if you just swing by for a short time.||January 27, 2015
Layla047||50||There is simply nowhere else like it - the food on offer is superb, the very best of produce is available, all being sold by wonderful friendly people who are both knowledgeable and passionate about their wares. You are encouraged to try everything before you buy, and can happily fill up as you pootle around. Market sellers at their absolute best ||January 27, 2015
878gemmaw||50||Fantastic food selection all countries public house too.Very busy area London Bridge close byGo and have a look it's worth it To see the specialities ||January 27, 2015
Zwapano F||40||The Market is especially busy and buzzing on Saturday mornings. The wide variety of food stands always leaves me having a hard time deciding on what I actually want! There are nice options for food to eat immediately or breads, cheeses and meats to take home for later.||January 26, 2015
MarineMaize||50||We went to the Borough Market because i'm a huge fan of food (so as my friends) and it was really beautiful and so charming ! The food was delicious and the stand so bucolic ! But it was a little small (from what i read it was supposed to be big...) A place to visit in London !||January 26, 2015
KeepSmilingUK||40||The atmosphere here on a Saturday is out of this world. It's packed with people, four or five deep at all the lunchtime food stalls. The smell of familiar and exotic foods is overpowering. You have to eat something, but what to choose - veggie, spicy, filling, traditional, something you've never dared to try before? It's all here - none of it very cheap and you'll have to walk to the back of the Market to find somewhere to sit or just walk around eating your chosen grub and soaking up the vibe.Go under the arches to take a look at all the other stalls selling some great produce - breads, cheeses, fruit, vegetables. It's all high quality and that's reflected in the above-average prices.But even if you don't eat anything or buy anything, you're certain to enjoy just being there.||January 26, 2015
216gregm||50||This is a must see for any London visitor who loves food. Crowded to a ridiculous extent, but with people who know how to move through tight spaces without jostling. The array of cheese, fruit, veg, meat, seafood, bread and street food is sensational. A couple of pubs at the entrance serve a good pint for the weary market goer. I loved talking to the producers who really know and love their produce. I will go back any time I am in London.||January 26, 2015
marksw3960||50||It would be impossible to visit this food bazaar without actually eating something. The atmosphere of bustling market stalls with splendid displays and such a cornucopia of wonderful aromas precludes any such resistance.Luckily my partner had scoped out the offer and recommended the Boston Sausage company for a Winter Burger Special. A burger of goodness with real meat, delicious sauce so far away from fast food as to be supersonic. Situated near the Cathedral we were able to sit and enjoy our al fresco (in December!) treat with like minded coves. It really is one of Londons more interesting experience, yes its shopping of a kind but the kind of shopping that has a point of difference at every turn and memories that force a return.||January 26, 2015
malawi40||40||We just strolled round the market on Saturday morning. We had already planned to go to lunch at The George Inn just across the road in Borough High Street so we had to resist the temptation to eat at almost every stall. But we did buy some pastries and cakes to eat later on.You could easily spend a fortune here and gain weight!A wonderful experience.||January 26, 2015
caitykiss||50||We went just before Christmas and the atmosphere was chaotic but great. We took our pram which was a mistake, but we went early enough to avoid the hugely dense crowds. By 10am it was quite busy. The food is remarkable and the coffee at Monmouth was great. We bought lots of cheeses and bread and fruit and veg and went home for a wonderful lunch.||January 25, 2015
Frenchydressing||40||Went there for lunch! it was amazing! SO much choices of thing to eat! You have to go around the ALL market before making your choices. Do not be afraid to try something new and exotic!! Go there for lunch!But you won't be alone so be prepare to wait a bit. Also you can't sit so walk around with your food!A Must in your to do list!||January 25, 2015
NatalieNickol||50||It has various food in it, British and also from all around the world. It is quite near Southwark Cathedral and London Bridge, so you can see all of them very easily, at once. You can buy interesting food for home from here and the atmosphere of that market is worth feeling.||January 25, 2015
Bubiana||40||Hubby and I visited the Borough Markets twice on our trip to London. The Market itself can get quite crowded so I recommend heading there in the morning for a good look at the stalls before it gets busy (we went on a Thursday), and then head back there for the lunch time rush, or if your keen go for the crowds at lunchtime. The stalls are incredible, there is amazing fruit and veggies (was very disappointed that we didn't have a kitchen in our hotel otherwise I would have cooked up a storm), the sourdough is great and only 2 pound 50p for a delicious loaf, the fish and poultry looked amazing and I recommend a juice from the juice stall (not the pre made one, there is a stall just around from that who makes them on the spot). On our return I tried the potato/cheesy thing that I cant remember the name of... should have probably gone for the paella, took about 15 min to line up and get lunch, but that is tourists, work crowd and just a whole lot of people. I also recommend getting some cheesecake and a giant cookie! would defiantly visit again!||January 24, 2015
beardandbean||40||great to walk through a market that is literally packed with the food of the world. you can find good products of all descriptions. The unusual seafood, different meats and fresh veg are fab.the food stands are a little pricier than normal as you expect but its easy to find something for lunch; very hard to choose.be prepared though - its packed most of the time.||January 24, 2015
creativestartravel||40||Highly recommend visiting Borough Market. Full of lovely street food, nibbles, cakes and wine.It's about 5 mins walk from London Bridge station so if you're in the area play the market a visit.||January 24, 2015
andylandyl||50||Why have I only visited once or twice before when it is so close to home ? I really don't know. Visited recently and was stunned at the range of high quality stalls. My particular favourite was the liquorice stall. The Italian owners were really friendly took an interest in what we really would like and provided us with some fantastic liquorice.I think the best way to appreciate this market is to go with a few key recipes / unusual ingredients in mind then shop - rather than just wander around aimlessly - although I appreciate wandering can prompt thoughts of recipes and tourists also spend money on lunch etc. A great place to visit when in London. I must recommend it to visiting friends in future.||January 23, 2015
clivealive2016||40||You can be forgiven for missing this market under the railway viaducts near London Bridge Station, nestled beside Southwark Catherdral (worth a visit in itself). The market really is a bit of everything... from cheeses, mulled wines, truffles, hog roasts, artisan pies, salami to sausages, cookies, fudge and fish and chips. Take a stroll and let your nose lead you as ethiopian cooking aromas take over from where the sizzling hog-roast just got you drooling. Yes, you can walk around and taste a bit of most things, and you'll be tempted by many others, so good to stroll once around before you chose - don't forget there are two bits, the main part is to the south of the smaller triangle of stalls near to the Cathedral.I have to say that I found the prices were on the higher side of average, but you have everything here in one place to amaze your guests with that something a little different, or to just indulge your taste buds... very well worth a visit just to see and smell it all !||January 23, 2015
alan m||50||Great place to visit so much variety of foods,fish meats,veg etc.Go for snacking to taste and enjoy all on offer.Look ask questions just a great experience part of a day out around this part of London.||January 22, 2015
Jane M||50||Excellent quality and range if goods at this food biased market near the river. Superb cheeses and a brilliant spice shop.Good choice for lunch too, a London classic.||January 20, 2015
AlanH526||50||I have never been here before, but will most certainly go back, with empty bags to carry bits home in. If you like NICE food and things a little bit nicer than normal, make sure you visit this market. There is a great selection of produce from across Europe (Cheese was brilliant). I could spend hours here...||January 19, 2015
Skeppers19||50||This market is brilliant - the food on offer is very good and its popular with locals and visitors - lots of specialist provisions are available - I like the mushroom seller and the specialist meat stores - but all tastes are catered for and the veggie selections are brilliant - I think this is the best market in London - its in Southwark so Shakespeare's Globe is very close too..||January 19, 2015
g0tthetshirt||50||Always love going to this market!Such variety and genuinely good quality (albeit pricey) foods.Try the cream doughnuts and the giant cookies - yum!! Also fab if you're an ethical eater / vegetarian - LOTS of options available :).||January 18, 2015
Richard G||50||I suppose I have been coming here most weeks on and off for about ten years. After a refurbishment associated with the Thameslink works the market is now bigger and with more stalls than ever. Food wise you can get most meat and veg you can think of, including organic and free range, there are two or three fish mongers, bakers, several cheese stalls, some very decent wine merchants and plenty of choices for eating. The market itself can get very packed, I usually avoid Saturdays and lunch hours if I can. Its a pleasant environment in a very old part of London but I can't understand why some people just want to take pictures, instead of buy and or eat? There should be something to tempt just about everybody.||January 18, 2015
BertheUK||40||Have long seen recommendations to Borough Market in the media but even so I was unsure what to expect, however I was agreeably surprised at the number and variety of stallsWe visited on a Saturday so it was busy but not uncomfortable, very colourful stalls, and smiling sellers, lots of samples to try...a wonderful array of cheeses, spices, mustards, pickles, pies, cold meats, pies and cakes of all varieties as well as lovely fruit and veg stalls. lots of it is under cover so don't despair if it rains, all us not lost you can still enjoy it. A fun visit ..... Which I will certainly do again||January 18, 2015
Tinkerbell1940||50||Great place bursting with atmosphere and amazing smells. Huge choice in many cuisines,most of them are reasonably priced. Recommend visiting and going to London as the hustle and bustle of the market is to be enjoyed. The olive bread is absolutely amazing and stays fresh for a few days highly recommended.||January 18, 2015
PFTraveller62||50||So close to London Bridge Tube (not Borough). I love this Market. It has such a good buzz about the place. So many stalls selling different meats, cheeses, breads and cakes you can't fail to buy something. Go there hungry so that you can gorge yourself at all the different food stalls and with plenty of drinking holes surrounding the Market, you get the full package for a good day out. Saturday was a little busy so try and go mid-week.||January 18, 2015
GlamNik7||50||I have to visit Borough Market when in the areA. The stalls are well laid out with yummy food. If you like liquorice there is a great stall and they let you try before you buy. Lots of great fruit and veg stalls with cheese and delii type stalls. A great walk from Waterloo along south bank.Shard is near by so loads to do and see||January 17, 2015
pedro00||40||It was a Saturday morning, so it was packed, mostly tourists. But what a selection, fruit and veg, cheeses, meat and fish. Also plenty of food stalls. The downside is that it was so busy it's hard to find a quiet corner to eat your purchases!||January 17, 2015
seaskills||50||I love markets. I watched the San Francisco market grow and finally land in the Ferry Building several years ago. I love the Green Market in NYC. And always thought Detroit's Eastern Market was a relatively well kept secret. But the Borough Market? Incredible. I won't bother with words - it's chock-a-block packed on the weekends, so get there early. Come hungry - many food vendors and adjacent eateries. Great find -||January 17, 2015
Nina D||50||I love it hear and so will you if you are a foodie. full of vibrant colours fresh foods, meats, fish, veg, spices, breads, desserts, it is endless. It is happy and people watching is fun. Chorizo rolls are great if you are on the move, the hazelnut praline doughnuts, the Cheese Toastie is like no other. The Baklava really is the best and the fruit juices are perfect. There is something for everyone hear and it is good quality. Spice world has every spice you can imagine. When you have had enough or want a break there is a good wine bar to put your feet up. I love it here and will always keep going back||January 16, 2015
mariodagot||50||Nice place to have a bite to eat and relax. You can try several delicacies from the outdoor stands: vegetarian, Indian, european, Turkish sweets, ... So good.||January 15, 2015
DJWM68||50||Borough market is just great if you are a foodie. Loads of foods you will not find readily elsewhere and the people are really friendly. Lots of samples to try before you buy and a turkish delight stall (towards the back) that is fantastic. Borough Olives (also at the back) does the most amazing chilli and feta paste you have ever tasted. Bread, cakes, exotic fruits and vege (loads of meat but Im a vegetarian!!!) So worth a visit, I also spotted a few celebs, proper ones at that!!!||January 15, 2015
AdrianaKupresak||50||“LET’S JUST WALK AROUND SAMPLING ALL THE CHEESE, OLIVE OIL… AND EVERYTHING ELSE…”Samples lead to sales and £60 later, I’ve purchased olive paste from Taste Croatia, goats cheese from France, balsamic vinegar glaze in Original (Linda in truffle flavour), green olives stuffed with haloumi cheese to snack on with crayfish tails followed by a freshly made chicken wrap with sweet chilli sauce to claim as my brunch. Linda has fallen in love with oysters from Shell Seekers and keeps coming back for more, moments later the staff at the roast hog tent refuse to give away crackling samples which upsets her. Nothing another oyster can’t fix....An extract from my Blog post...||January 15, 2015
cy_sg||40||We went over to the Borough Market on a Thursday morning as the shops were opening. The market is a short stroll from the London Bridge tube station.The shops are not what you would expect to find in a typical open market but nevertheless still an excellent attraction to visit whether you're buying anything. Everything from artisan breads and pastries, gourmet cooking oils, fresh flowers, fresh seafood on ice and handmade crafts. It's certainly worth a short visit, especially if you're on the way to visit the Bridge or the Shard which are both a short stroll away.||January 14, 2015
p p||50||We went on a busy Saturday morning, there were lots of varieties of food available, all reasonably priced with good portions, suitable for veg. and non-veg. Don't forget there are 2 parts to this market as you cross over the road there are more food stalls, so check both ends before deciding what you want for lunch. Also be prepare for long lunch queues especially on Saturday, but definitely worth the wait.||January 13, 2015
JulianneS381||50||Stopped thru here on a day of site seeing.....ended up spending 3 hours looking around. So many delicious items available for purchase. Everything from fruits and veggies to meats and cheeses to mulled cider and Prosecco. Fantastic places to eat as well......I recommend stopping at the Wine Wharf to grab a glass of bubbly and regroup. Loved being there during the holiday season. This was an absolute joy.||January 13, 2015
arrumeiasmalaseparti||30||I went to Borough market looking forward to find new and different spicies, however, i found a place with different chocolate, some food and a place where you can buy fruits and vegetables.The fresh juice super worth the visit, taking into consideration how difficult is to find fresh juice in England.We ate a burger, but the queues were too long and there were no spaces to sit and enjoy the food.But it is a place that we need to visit to know more than landmarks. ||January 13, 2015
Duncan T||50||Borough Market was fairly low on my list of things to see and do while living in London. However when Natalie and I finally got around to visiting we regretted waiting so long. The street food is incredible no matter what stall you stop at. My recommendation would be the wild venison burger, it's cooked to perfection! Other things not to miss: 18 month aged Gouda from France, Bath cheese company's blue cheese, the best Chai tea this side of India, wonderful turkish coffee and the specialty beer shop. The only thing is that you should make an effort to visit on a weekday, it gets incredibly busy during the weekend. We visited on a Wednesday and all the stalls was open, but there weren't too many people there. When we went back on a Saturday, you could barely move in there.||January 12, 2015
GeorgeJWM||40||Any foodie could spend a long while here but you're not half left gulping at some of the prices for very ordinary things. It's just a great place to wander around taking in the sights and smells of lots of different foods, taking in the odd sample or two. One of the bread stalls near the exit to London Bridge tube station does a really good olive soft bread stick.||January 12, 2015
WoodyJ07||50||I work as a chef so Borough market so loved it spends about 2 hours the first time and went back a week later with friends it was just as good the second time.||January 11, 2015
Legal_itinerant||40||If you enjoy street food this is definitely the place to visit. It is easily accessible by tube (Jubilee Line) so no hassles getting here whatsoever. Unlike some of the other markets, the quality of products is good but be prepared for queues. Everything looks scrumptious and unusual. The market itself is not very large but the selection is still quite extensive. You can walk along the river and see the other interesting places in this colorful part of London. ||January 10, 2015
sarakhanafiah||40||I love food and this place was just too cool! The oysters were so fresh and so many variety of food sold. The place is buzzing and we love just walking around and sampling stuff and eating. Worth the visit!||January 10, 2015
Anna W||50||This market is vibrant and full of exciting tastes and flavours. I love just wondering the stalls and looking at the delights on offer. While it is busy it is not overcrowded and it has a good buzz. There were so many delicious bread stalls and cheeses galore - the smells overpowering. I would love to take this market and move it to my home town so I can wander there every weekend!||January 10, 2015
Katesr||50||What we loved - variety of foods to try, the buzz of the market, the colors, flavors and smells of everything. The only downside (and this should be no surprise given what we loved) is that the market is very busy so be prepared to queue up and don't go if you are in a hurry or don't like crowds. ||January 10, 2015
charly20071||50||More of a tourist destination than it used to be but when everything here is of such high quality who cares?A couple of great pubs and restaurants along with street food stalls make it a great place to spend a few hours grazing and hanging out.Highly recommended .||January 10, 2015
Sharkalark||40||I stopped at this place on the Saturday after Christmas. It was insanely crowded. I had done some research and knew the stands I wanted to see. Sadly, they were closed. I still had an amazing lunch.||January 9, 2015
smacka21||50||If you love your cheese and would like to sample all sorts of varieties then this is the place to go. I've not seen so many cheese stalls in one place with so much on offer. There are great fruit and veggie stalls too, bread, wines, ales, meats (one shop is dedicated to Spainish food and has Jamon being carved on the spot, could be more) and fish with the biggest scallops I've seen in a long time and on it goes. Everything is top notch amongst the many stalls in the market as well as the shops surrounding it.Or simply go to buy some food and you won't be disappointed. Nearby is the Tate Modern, The Shard and not too far from Tower Bridge. Easy to get to by bus or tube.||January 9, 2015
Claudia26||50||This is certainly a must do experience for food lovers. Wonderful cheese, bread, different types of meat, etc., etc. All in a lovely place with attentive customer service.I recommend the burger place - we had a lamb with mint burger which was fantastic! We shared one (big mistake!) and when we went back for more it was closed. So I'll have to come back to England to have another one!||January 9, 2015
kiwig14||50||Beautiful stalls, wonderful food, crafts and anything else. Every conceivable food you could find from all over the world. Beautiful setting, eat your way through the stalls or buy food for later and then visit one of the great restaurants nearby. You could also see the Tate which is close by. Of all the markets this is one of the best.||January 8, 2015
magictoast||50||Fresh produce, cheeses, cuts of meat and so much more. Do not miss the fresh oysters, or the duck confit sandwich at the stall that also sells sangria! Then head off to Monmouth Coffee outside the market to wash it all down with a steaming aromatic cup of java.||January 8, 2015
393LuC||50||One of my favourite places in London; loads of beautiful food so go with an empty stomach! Only bummer is it does get very, very busy.||January 7, 2015
Malleville||40||It's just as well we visited with the grandchildren, or we would have hit the debit cards very hard and spent a lot longer here. All the same, the boys enjoyed their burgers, their two grans enjoyed their bacon rolls, and I really enjoyed my Angus/Wagyu burger, even if I couldn't quite identify the cheese (with cream ?) topping. For the rest of the family outing, we window-shopped round the unbelievable variety of the foodies' paradise, tasted as many of the samples on offer as possible, and for the rest, just gawped at as much as we could take in. An ideal start to the Christmas food and drink marathon !||January 7, 2015
sunnykhedkar||40||It was a cold and rainy day but i made it to the market after hearing a lot about it. I however didnt know that this market is only known for food. Once i got there.... I straight looked for the stall scotchtail... This is where anthony boudair tried his scotch eggs and had rated the best ones he'd eaten so i tried em and i did like them. So thats my recommendation, i would also recommend the ousters and the freshly made burger. Defi a place to visit for food lovers! ||January 6, 2015
HollyHouse01||50||Now one of my favourite places to visit in London. Great to wander around & soak up the atmosphere but SO much great food to try & buy||January 6, 2015
Junrong L||50||If you love tasting and buying different types of food at top quality (especially the foodies), this place is a must go! I have made a trip to Borough Market the last 2 times I've been to London and I never get bored of it. There are so many shops that sell cheeses, dried and cured meats, jams, olive oils, bread, fresh seafood (and oysters!) etc. It's really overwhelming. I would suggest coming early on a Saturday when it isn't too crowded. Nevertheless, here are a few of my favourite stalls:La Tua Fresh Pasta - delicious and affordable fresh pastas to have on the spot or to go.The Olive Oil Company - quality olive oils (many that are new harvest ones) and balsamic vinegars and good prices.Tea2You - Amazing quality teas at affordable prices. The star teas are the Darjeeling first and second flushes. You'll be impressed!The Parma Ham and Mozzarella Stand - Quality Mozzarellas, Burratas and parma hams!Spice Mountain - The people here really know their spices. There are literally a hundred over different spices and blends you can get. Prices are also reasonable. We bought the real Ceylon Cinnamon sticks and Saffrons. There's also this shop that sells all types of flavoured mustards. Try the truffle mustard!There are so many other amazing stalls with passionate people who run them that I don't think you will not be able to find what you like. What's more, you can taste the food before you buy them! Afterwards, you could just head over to Geletaria 3Bis (just 1 minute away) for one of the best Gelatos in London!||January 6, 2015
Curious806360||50||I love the different types of food they have on sale here... I have been about 5/6 times within the past 2 years. If I could afford to go every week I would! I love this place! ||January 5, 2015
tripmama14618||50||Go with the idea of splitting and trying lots of diferent items. The market is a great place, ecelectic vendors and enormous food variety with a fun hustle bustle atmosphere. Most items are 5 uk pounds, and portions are huge so splitting is advised. We loved the duck confit sandwich,it is a 5 star must try! Others were enjoying oysters, fish and chips, ethiopian fare that looked fabulous and from experience the pasteries are fantastic. The fair trade coffee and chocolate house across the street was an excellent place to warmup end our market afternoon and enjoy a dessert and hot drink, just before heading to the Tate Modern only a 10 minute walk away.||January 5, 2015
ElaineAndGreg||50||The Borough Market has over 2500 reviews on this site, the vast majority of which are excellent, followed by a large number of very good. The market is only steps from the London Bridge underground station. It is also right next to the lovely Southwark Cathedral. The market is packed, and for good reason, as the food is excellent. It's awfully busy, but you can buy lunch and eat it in the yard by the cathedral. The food is well above average, particularly for fans of artisan cheeses and hams.I would suggest coming here, soaking in the ambience, and then enjoying the serenity and beauty of Southwark Cathedral.||January 4, 2015
MartaSte||50||Very lovely market near the river: Street food and shops!It is nice for a special lunch and for buy an unusual food from all over the world.There is a relax area with benches where you can eat.||January 4, 2015
TravelisHeaven||50||Very close to the Tate Modern so great for a pre museum snack or coffee. So many booths that one could hang here for hours.||January 4, 2015
sfhome1||50||This is the market to go to for specialty food items as well as fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, baked items, and fresh game. This was so much better than the Harrod's Food Hall, which I thought was disappointing. I bought some small batch balsamic vinegar and tasted olive oils. My friend tried several types of bread at different vendors. One booth had 4 types of paella in giant paella pans. Fun!||January 4, 2015
john_mason950||50||the market is a gem there are lots of specialized foods that needs to be sampled along with a glass of wine or mulled wine, there is everything that you could want - we used to go just for breakfast and watch the world go by ||January 4, 2015
Elaine S||50||Excellent place to get good street food and browse food stalls. Loads to choose from. You will be spoilt for choice.||January 4, 2015
Familycat022||40||Fourth visit to Borough Market and range and quality of offerings remains high. Always fun to stroll around having tasters and chatting to stall holders before deciding what to buy to both eat straight away and bring home. Nice atmosphere even when crowded, take your time to explore it and make sure you have space to sample the lovely foods!||January 3, 2015
ordinary-folk||40||I've lived in London for over 40 years and seen Borough Market change from a traditional wholesale fruit and veg market to what is today. A real touristy place, with prices to match! The stall holders near the steps from the bridge seem to charge 25% more for their takeaway food than those inside the market proper. But it is a fun place to visit. The choice of European meats, cheeses, olives, olive oils, breads etc is fantastic. I saw a couple of traditional English fruit and veg stalls, selling locally grown produce (local to the growers - not London!). There is a traditional cafe in the middle of the market (Maria's Market cafe) which is good for a basic fry-up and tea or coffee (nescafe) for under £10 for two. There also is a good choice of sit in restaurants around the outside. A good place to go if you wanted different ingredients for a special meal!||January 3, 2015
Sandy5611||40||Go and check out this place late afternoon, early evening after working hours. You will like the buzz. Nice bars just outside the market and good food for a quick bite to accompany your drinks.||January 3, 2015
Bella3490||50||It's is packed, it doesn't open everyday but TOTALLY WORTH IT! You can have little snacks in several stands or walk around and then choose a restaurant to have a proper meal. Either way you won't regret it. I suggest walking around before deciding what to eat since every corner hides delicious food!||January 2, 2015
MikeD934||50||A wonderful food market with every type of food you could wish for. There's a great atmosphere and stall catering for every taste and budget. Worth a trip even though it can get very busy. ||January 2, 2015
DeanDada||50||You must come here! It is one of the oldest market in town. You can eat very nice food from different parts of the world. Or you can just buy cheeses, salami, bread, biscuits, fresh veg and fruits and more to take home. We had a nice meal. If you are not hungry they will make you!We could not find a toilet, so we used the one of a pub nearby.||January 2, 2015
Katiebob93||40||Famous for a reason, visiting Borough Market is a must if you're in London and have the time. Stop by for an interesting lunch or collect some exotic goods. It's also a good place to find good value vegetables that actually have taste, unlike the supermarket types. Plus - there are custard apples!||January 2, 2015
HaveWineWilTravel||50||My only regret is that my husband and I were staying in a hotel not a flat this visit to London. Next time I will need a flat so I can shop the Borough Market's fantastic stalls to buy the ingredients for an extraordinary meal. The cheese, wild game, veggies, chocolates etc... were all exceptional and the vendors were so nice. Anyone that enjoys food needs to explore this market. We didn't even get to try some of the prepared foods which were so well-priced (especially for London) and all good so tasty.I can't wait until our next visit.||January 2, 2015
Eemay V||50||It's a food market just down the road when you get off London Bridge station and just next to the Shard. It is a very lively and happening place. We went there a week before Christmas and it was quite crowded but not to the point where you have to start pushing each other to get through. You would have to queue for more popular stalls - we had to queue for the Ethiopian food stall and also the Japanese stall where they sell delicious Gyoza so it was all worth it! They have free toilet facilities and also places for you to sit and enjoy your food at one corner. Towards the back of the market, there's a small shop which sell fresh from the sea oysters and they were delicious! We had 6 medium rock oysters for £8 (they ran out of big sized oysters sadly) with your choice of free lime, tabasco chillis, cut chillis or onions (I'm not sure if that's cheap or not but it was definitely very fresh!). I would definitely come for the food spree again!||December 31, 2014
Mathew M||50||Great place to visit in London ...plenty of great produce and vendors that are happy to talk to you....fabulous cheese stall Owen by a lovely Swiss guy....we ate at a few stalls and bought some produce to have on our trip.....a real surprise||December 31, 2014
billmanou||50||It's a different market and you can see everything.I love this place,You MUST visit this place!!!!!For the best place for today travelling||December 30, 2014
JamieTan03||50||I love the market as I would try many types of nice food at reasonable price plus they are in large portion too :p I will definitely recommend to others. ||December 30, 2014
FamilyfourSG||40||We were there the week before Christmas but it was very packed. There were queues in every popular cooked food stalls. We ate pad thai at the Thai noodle stall but it was not good. Goods and drinks sold were pricey and touristy. There are more cooked food stalls and stalls selling exotic items (Indian spices, teas packed in little sachets) than those traditional stalls (fruits, vege, eggs, fresh meat)from a farmers market. It does not seemed to have any toilet facilities as we had to sneak into one of the restaurant to use its facilities instead. Good for tasting samples but I think we can get the items cheaper at supermarkets or other markets.||December 29, 2014
777JaneB||50||LOVE visiting Brough Market when in London. Extensive amount of food and drinks. Friendly stall holders, wonderful food stalls serving food from all over the world. It was decorated really nice for Christmas and the shops and bars around the market are also fun. We came back at night after being close by at the Gong bar in The Shard and bar hopped and had a brilliant time.||December 28, 2014
georgiosl475||40||We visited Borough Market the week before Christmas and really liked the festive decoration. Traditional, home made pies, Christmas puddings and cakes were amazing. However, it felt more of a tourist attraction and not so "traditional". Nevertheless it is a charming food market worth visiting.||December 28, 2014
Liza B||50||What an intro of London! This was one of my biggest highlight during my trip in London. Great atmosphere, lovely people and incredible food! As I was here before Christmas, the market was just pure madness(in a nice way)! The great varieties of pastries, fresh meat, exotic meats, cheese, fruits, vegetables, local specialties, OMG, the list goes on and on and on......!!! I managed to try a few local bites such as to die for.. deep fried on the spot scotch eggs, pulled pork sandwich and XL size oysters. I wish I have the tummy of a giant as everything else looks so delicious!!! Would highly HIGHLY recommend to everyone!!||December 28, 2014
Ian P||40||This is paradise to any foodie. There are food stalls with choices from all over the world. The smell is fantastic with the mixture of spices and ingredients from the different stalls mixing in the air. You can get anything from a Hot dog to Kangaroo. It does get very busy so if you are not keen on crowds be warned. For a drink, there are many bars around the edge including The Wheatsheaf which does some very nice ales and lagers and for wine lovers Vinoplois is just at the edge of the market too.||December 28, 2014
paul w||50||Close to London bridge station and the shard ,lots of different food from various places .A great selection of food on offer from local fish ,cheese, different selection of pies ,curry ,burgers, different meats from excotic places inc reindeer,zebra,camel,kangaroo and lots more. There is also A couple of local pubs at the bottom end always a good atmosphere .I will return here next time I travel and sample some of the excotic meats as I've had quite a few different animals but am up for tasting some new ones, will take a cool bag with some ice blocks so I can transport them back without getting warm.Walk to the bottom of the road when you get out of London bridge station and cross the road the massage way is straight in front of you ask if you can't find it as it's worth a quick look around.||December 27, 2014
Prue S||50||Catalan stew? Farm-made sausages? Portuguese custard tarts, cheese, mushrooms in a dozen different varieties, wine, did I mention the cheese? Pasta. Borough Market is all about the food and some of the best of British artisanal producers are here. Buy to eat here or take home. Gets very crowded but well worth forcing your way through.||December 27, 2014
myfunnybones||40||Something for all. Food glorious food.Drinks and something extra unlike anywhere else. Come and see for yourself...even a food stand purely for vegetarians now that's unique!||December 27, 2014
denisefromCA_AZ||50||Well worth a visit for any foodie! It was exceptionally crowded when we were there but other than that, was a fabulous sensory experience, all the sights and smells and tastes, if we were not in a hotel I would have bought the makings for a fabulous feast. The market is located right at the edge of the London Bridge, perhaps not as impressive as the original in Lake Havasu City, AZ, but a nice bridge just the same.||December 27, 2014
MetalTiger||50||and cheeses, fruit, vegetables, bread of all sorts and sizes, rare breeds meat, game, cakes, oils, you name it - if it can be eaten it will be at Borough Market. Just looking makes you hungry so it is useful that some of the stands sell food to be eaten there and then - soup, pork batches, hamburgers etc. Whether you are just a tourist or a serious food addict this is a must to be added to your list.||December 26, 2014
yellowsubmarine117||40||Good variety of small stores selling cheese,fruits, smoked ham, sauciness and other farm products .Also many open air grill food stalls, with variety of Asian, European food. Some places have small sitting areas if not full.Otherwise around (outside) there are several good restaurants and pubs where one can relax and enjoy a proper meal after shopping /walking for hours...This place is better than Convent garden for variety of local food produce and quick meals.||December 26, 2014
Tippyleaf||40||Great atmosphere, wonderful selection of food fish, meat, cheeses, pate, fruit, veg, mushrooms. Plus great selection of cafés and takeaway food stalls. Yes it may be a little more expensive but the quality is great and stall holders knowledgable. ||December 25, 2014
Pkrekeler||30||This market has varied foods available. Unless you're truly grocery shopping, there are only a few things that might interest you. If you're just visiting as a tourist, give yourself 15-30 minutes to walk around and take in all of the booths.There are some delicious alfajores offered at one of the outside booths. Their empanadas smelled delicious but I can't vouch for them.There are both carnivorous booths and vegan-friendly booths to be visited.||December 25, 2014
Nanhi M||50||On a recent business trip to London, we were given a lunch allowance and asked to go to Borough Market to have something to eat. What a delight walking around the market and gazing at the stalls! Everything looked inviting and tempting and it took a lot of will power to resist the spread.It's expensive, no doubts about that but was worth the experience. It is a gourmet paradise and a lovely opportunity to click some beautiful pictures.||December 25, 2014
Patricia6048_10||40||Try to get to Borough Market for a pre-Christmas visit every year. Travel up from Dorset to purchase some gourmet specials - cheeses, pates, three bird roast. Not cheap but quality produce - just a few luxuries for the festive season.||December 24, 2014
sunworshipperDublin||30||Theres not a lot of traditional British food here, lots of spanish ingredients which are ten times the price they are in spain, French cheeses- good range but you pay. Organic meat and organic veg are great quality so i go for that. The Turkish store with the mezze plate and bread for 5 pounds is the best value lunch deal cos they have tables too and nice view of street - beautiful range of olives and home made turkish delight there too. theres Ethiopian, middle eastern, oysters, pulled pork buns, roast in a roll and stuff like that for around 6 quid for lunch.Elliots Cafe is one of the best restaurants in London. Simple bistro but wonderful food combinations, reasonable prices and lots of chefs eat here Im told!Go early in the week and early in the day at the weekend- otherwise its too hectic||December 23, 2014
MichaelVisits||40||My Wife was recommended to visit Borough Market by a colleague and we were not disappointed. There was an amazing array of stalls selling fresh food and produce and the area also has many great looking restaurants. If you like food and cooking and are ever looking for something special then this is a good place to look. We will be visiting again and plan our visit around lunch or dinner so we can try one of the local restaurants.||December 22, 2014
Landanguy||40||It's wonderful when you find a beautiful use of an otherwise absolute mess. This is the borough market, apparently labyrinthine, under the railways and still incredibly charming and soul warming. A great highlight of the trip to London. Great food, but as everything in Landan...a bit over prized (still worth it).||December 22, 2014
Khaneseur||40||I really enjoyed walking the stalls and sampling various farm to fork fare. People are very friendly, and the food stuffs are delightful. It's a real gem. Lots of cheeses, charcuterie, juices, fruits and veggies, breads, olives...it's just enjoyable to walk around.||December 22, 2014
gez4000609||50||I was in London yesterday & after walking down the south embankment from vaxhall bridge to tower Bridge I stopped off at Borough Market sw1 It was nice to sit down & have a lovely coffee from 1 of the stalls & watch the people going by . As it was a cold windy day it was nice to be out of the wind & under cover but with an out side feel to it. There was lots of small stalls selling all sorts from oysters to a Turkish stall beer to beef burgers with the sound & smells to tempt passes by to come & enjoy all there is or as I did just to have a coffee & watch the world go by. It's easy to find as it's just a short walk from London Bridge ||December 22, 2014
Wobbea||50||I am a frequent visitor. I mainly go to buy cheese and visit the Banana Store. I am often tempted by other stalls||December 22, 2014
sierrab||50||A very beautiful and authentic market which is easy to find, near London Bridge station, Borough station or just find Southwark Cathedral South of the River. Best coming here for food from the market stalls around or before lunchtime to avoid the crowd. I love Borough market for the food, the display of colours and array of fresh products from awesome cheese to olive oil, bread, cakes, meat , fish or spices ... You will find everything exciting (except the crowd perhaps) . Take your camera, a Fiver will get you a kangaroo burger cooked on the spot, I love the Balkan borek and the spanish Tapas - However, I never made it to Montmouth coffee ... still queue outside . 1 x Paddington Bear spotted there, opposite Montmouth cafe. (Bread section ) the doughnut with vanilla cream at £ 2.50 is a bit of a rip off but to die for ! Praline not bad ...I 'll stick to my crunchy baguette with green olives at £2.00.Toilets are located in the Market Hall, that's where all the glass window panels are from the street view and the space looks like a hot house with red tinsels are hanging down, flying in the breeze. It's also where you can find information about the market itself : map / Plan/ general information. It's often difficult to find space in cafes, so walk about out and around the market, there are various places to sit down for a cuppa and further down on Borough High street towards Elephant, 5mn walk away on the left there is a small north african cafe which has delicious food and mint tea , much more quiet and prices suddenly more reasonable than inside the market !||December 21, 2014
marlarkey99||50||Very busy market, one of the few remaining city markets. Here you'll find lots of genuine high quality interesting foods of all different kinds, fresh meats, seafoods, fruits, veg, breads, etc.... also lots of street food stalls. Great place to visit.||December 20, 2014
Jackie T||50||Absolutely brilliant time here well recommended! The food stalls were amazing, fresh produce! We wandered around trying all the different foods people had to offer!!||December 20, 2014
StuckinBangers||50||Walked from Clerkenwell on a Sunday and stumbled on the markets walking up the Thames. The pig on the spit pricked my interest at the edge of the markets and then inside an amazing selection of produce. Found an oyster shop where they shucked some fresh Essex oysters - 5 pounds for 4 superb oysters. Salted beef sandwiches, curries - you name it, its here.||December 19, 2014
primada||50||I don't even like markets but this place is mesmerising. I love the array if food that's available from all over the world. I wish I lived here and could visit every day. It's just amazing. A foodie paradise! ||December 19, 2014
Bobby D||50||A must visit if you are lover of different types of foods and also the traditional foods we all love. All of the stalls staff are friendly and knowledgable and most offer free tasters of their products. We have been many times but at Christmas time this market is even more special and really gets you in the mood. Another of London's must visit places if you are in the city.||December 19, 2014
Michael-Newbury||50||This is a place to visit for all the family at during Advent when there are visiting stalls offering tasty morsels from around the world mixed with the traditional permanent stalls.When I visited a choir was signing Christmas carols which added to the joy of the occasion.For those who have visited before, the market has been updated as a result of the widening of the overhead Borough Junction by the addition of a new rail bridge.The market has the added advantage of being adjacent to Southwark Cathedral so a visit to the market and be combined with a visit to the cathedral.||December 19, 2014
simone p||40||Loved the market, great buzz, fabulous gourmet treats on offer with tasting opportunities on most stalls, friendly sellers, festive ambiance. Lots of great ideas for xmas treats and gifts. However bring plenty of money as you will need it! Not for the budget traveller though you can still enjoy the tastings if you dont spend much money. ||December 19, 2014
Fernanda P||50||Amazing place and in the Christmas times is better! The environment is wonderful and you can buy a lot of delicious food. There are many different cheese and olive oil. You should try the food at "Total Organics"! They have vegetarian food and natural juices! ||December 18, 2014
Markfiftyfive||50||A really buzzing, fun attraction. Not only a seriously good traditional food market, but supplemented by numerous multi-national stalls selling delicious snacks and meals. Go at lunch time and eat your way around the world !Brilliant !||December 17, 2014
SiameseTomCat||40||This market is somehow a very exciting place to visit and a wonderful example of London's mix of the old and new with the fabulous Shard rising high in the sky above it. There are numerous venders selling mostly high quality foods under the shelter of the railway line. The market has a great feel about it and there a many samples to be had from the various stalls to tempt you to buy more, and they did! We really enjoyed just walking around and seeing all the wonderful food and drink. Its well worth a visit and it will be on our agenda next time we visit the area||December 17, 2014
allaboutcricket||40||Although very busy this market was lovely with so many different types of food to buy to eat straight away or take home to cook. The mulled wine went down very well and the whole market was so Christmassy - we definitely recommend it.||December 17, 2014
Watson H||50||I used to work in this area many years ago when this was purely a fruit and veg market for the trade, and it is great to see the way that it has evolved now into a center for excellent food, either to cook with or to eat as a take away meal. so far I have only bought from The Ginger Pig, where we had two very tasty raised pies of chicken and leek and steak and ale. There are various countries represented, with many wonderful choices of meats, cheeses, breads etc, and it all is presented in a friendly atmosphere and even has a newish covered atrium with seating so you can enjoy the many take away choices on hand. Just beyond the market are more attractions, pubs and of course the south bank.||December 16, 2014
Mike K||50||Trying to fit in everything you want to see and do during a long weekend in London is a challenge, however, if you can find the time, Borough Market should be on your list. Normally closed on a Sunday, the pre-Christmas atmosphere was well worth the visit. You'll find a fantastic selection of stalls to explore. A foodie's paradise!||December 15, 2014
K254CFtimp||40||It's a lovely Market, especially for cheese fans. There are many stalls, most of which try to temp you with free tastings, with so much variety available. There is a real buzz about the place creating a real fun atmosphere. It's definitely did not seem cheaper than the shops but definitely more fun.||December 15, 2014
luisj37||50||One of the best markets I have visited in Europe. Lots of variety from around the world and excellent fresh produce. Towards the back of the market there are a lot of food vendors with excellent "street" fair from falafel to Paella. ||December 15, 2014
hurricanekatrinarule||40||This a must visit place if you like good food and produce. Great varieties - too many to list. Some prices you can beat in the foreign supermarket chains with unusual fruit. Some places allow you to taste before you buy. If you are looking to top up a home prepared Christmas hamper this market is a must. Weekend is usually very busy so if you want to browse chose a weekday.||December 15, 2014
Daphneghs||50||I always make sure I come by this wonderful market because there are just so many things to taste and try, and so many favourites to eat again of them all! Always feel so greedy and wish I had more space in my already bulging tummy to try more food. Foodie or not, you will enjoy the wide variety of offerings and conversations you have with the vendors about their produce. For such a bustling venue, I think there should be more public toilets though, but they were at least clean.||December 14, 2014
doctorbob15||50||A great way to spend an afternoon. This covered market is extensive and filled with shops offering a very wide variety of foods and goods. Sampling is encouraged as is great discussions with the vendors about their offerings. Foodies will love the wide array of local and unusual (for non-UK folk) foods. For example, one vendor had about 20 different mustards to taste and buy. Local pate preserved in butter was a real treat.Afterwards, go about 2 blocks to the George Tavern for a half pint. The George is supposed to be the oldest tavern in London.||December 13, 2014
ireneteot||40||This is one market that I will always recommend my friends to visit when in London. Good selection of local produce and food, of which I will highly recommend all to have a duck confit sandwich at one particular stall in the market - the stall is closest to fronting the famous Monmouth coffee place. Enjoy!||December 12, 2014
William M||40||Really enjoyed our visit here !Plenty to see and do and for a food and drink lover a place you must visit.Loads of interesting and delicious food and drinks to try out.Lovely - will definitely be making another visit when I'm next n London.||December 11, 2014
nadialmyates||50||I used to spend every other lunchtime at Borough Market when I worked by London Bridge and if you know Borough Market well, or have visited you will know why. It has a vast variety of gorgeous and exciting food on offer as well as a Live Kitchen every week where you can witness food being cooked in front of you and sample it for free. The best food served at Borough Market I believe are either the Duck Confit Rolls, the Salt Beef Sandwiches from INSIDE the market (not the stall outside - sorry) or the Roast Pork sandwiches complete with crackling rolls near to the Duck Confit stand inside - although prepare to queue but it is well worth it! These three probably are my three most favourite sandwiches in the whole world - please see the photos I've uploaded. Definitely would recommend!!||December 11, 2014
548angelah||40||Queues and queues for the tasty toast sandwiches from this stall in Borough Market! Toasted cheese earnie for only six quid. Tasty and lovely!||December 11, 2014
Liz O||50||If you come to London, you must go to the Borough Markets. Very easy to get too from London Bridge tube. And it's also not far if you want to go see the Tower Bridge after or before.Lots of great food options. Also if your gluten free like me you must try The Free From Bakehouse. Everything from there is heavenly. The red velvet cupcake is to die for and the peanut butter blondie is delish if you a crazy PB fan like me! And the brownie...well even if your nor GF I still recommend!!!Enjoy this day out exploring :).||December 11, 2014
mtallyca||50||Visited Borough Market several times. The are many food booths too many to list. I purchased cheese, pasta, breads and pastries from different vendors and all tasted fresh and good. There are also food kiosks the cook up fresh hot foods for meat lovers and vegetarians. Its right near the London Bridge tube station on the Jubilee Line.||December 10, 2014
Ted B||50||All kinds of exotic food.Not cheap though.A great Market to stroll through but watch the cost of things.Often TV cooking programmes are filmed here.Great eating places but quite Touristy.||December 10, 2014
Julie D||50||I strongly recommend a visit to the Borough markets on a Saturday morning in London. Make sure you don't eat breakfast before you go, because the food is simply sensational. Wander through the crowds to the various food stalls and get a sense of real London. Highest recommendation- a food stall with freshly made donuts filled with creme patissiere. It's worth every calorie.||December 10, 2014
flstorms||40||How fun! If only we had one of these back home, I'd be introducing everyone I know to salted beef. We actually ended up here early in the morning and decided to turn it into our breakfast spot - so we grabbed some bread at one of the stands and coffee at Monmouth across the street. It's such a colorful array of foods, smells, sounds, tastes and textures that it's easy to get lost just walking and tasting for a couple hours.||December 9, 2014
Ruralretreat1||50||I can't recommend this market enough. We visited this weekend & loved it. I would suggest that you get there early because it does get very busy. There is so much to see & taste! Plenty of cheese stalls, & the fruit & vegetables are so fresh & colourful. I'll certainly be back soon. ||December 9, 2014
292claireCL||50||If you love food, Borough Market is definitely somewhere you should visit. It is a covered market place offering foods from all around the world from speciality cheeses, fruit, veg, a delicious variety of breads, fish hot and cold (the deep fried chilli calamari was exquisite!) chinese, thai to burgers and the traditional pie and mash. There is a great buzz on the market and, if it's a chilly day, you can choose a nice mulled wine or cider to warm you up.||December 9, 2014
lemuck13||50||Always somewhere I try to get to if I'm in London and have successfully a number of times. Plenty of superb food stalls, masses of choice, extremely lively atmosphere. Very popular and as such can be very busy so be prepared for that. ||December 8, 2014
TheoneandonlyBirdie||40||Visited on a Saturday afternoon end of November. Too many people was first observation . however tasting tempting foods and wines kept us there; chhese stalls abound alongside smoked meats and fish. Can be expensive but well worth a visit.||December 8, 2014
Franclsy||50||Had amazing times at the Borough Market. So much things and food to eat that i have to return there 3 times to try most of the food that interest me. Highly recommend the toasted cheese sandwich and scoth egg with sweet potato fries.||December 8, 2014
Kpjwboro||40||Possibly THE most televised food market in London this is definitely worth a visit. Some magnificent displays of every type of produce you can dream of - with ingredients for every masterchef, whether professional, celebrity or amateur||December 8, 2014
ErikIngeneeger||50||Great atmosphere, great food, definitely recommended for a quick streetfood bite of high quality and a great foodie shopping destination. ||December 8, 2014
Daffy_ang||40||Food, food and more food. The smells, the colours and the vibrancy make this a must go for all. You can walk for hours tasting food, buying small snacks or simply drinking wines, teas, juices, coffees... We couldn't seems to be able to leave the place even after walking for 3 hours around the market. Love it!||December 7, 2014
bellamacca||50||Lovely during the Christmas season especially. Great products, good quality , must visit at least once.||December 7, 2014
Berit696||40||The market is absolutely worth a visit. The selection of cheeses are very good, with possibility to have lots of samples before you decide. Plenty of other food too, and a nice wine shop/cafe. Several small places where you can sit down and have a bite, and several places that sells food from around the world. A good place to visit if you are interested in good food, and want to buy something for a special occasio, or just want to taste something different.||December 7, 2014
gwilliams||40||This used to be a regular market - now it very much caters to foodies, with a wide range of meats, cheeses, and veg. Also has ready to eat meals available off to the side. Great place to browse, and would also be excellent for buying for a special meal. ||December 7, 2014
Sofie W||50||This is the greatest food Market I have been to ever. Only If I was living hear so I could use it every day!||December 6, 2014
chinita_gal0314||50||This market was highly recommended by my friend as a "must-go" for the short time we were in London. Did not disappoint!! We spent the whole morning browsing and tasting all there was to offer: meats, cheeses, pastries, bread, fruit, sweets, wine... you name it! There was so much food, and just browsing around the stalls were so much fun! Would definitely recommend it to everyone to try at least once, but we are definitely coming back the next time we visit London.||December 6, 2014
Calamity999||50||If you are a foodie Borough Market is the place to go. The prices are inflated because it is such a key attraction for tourists and Londoners alike. Whether you want the most obscure cheeses, truffles, or just the ordinary you need to go. Go to Bread Ahead for custard donuts||December 6, 2014
SurreyJanice||50||If you fancy a good breakfast go to Maria's cafe. It does the best bubble I've ever tasted since my nan's. Try the coffee at Monmouths. You'll always see a queue there! People travel far and wide for the taste and expertise. Early Saturday mornings are best before the rush. Get there for opening time at 9 am. We'll worth getting up for! ||December 6, 2014
cryyzac||50||Amazing place, didn,t realize it existed I do now, we came a little late so it was winding down, but we managed to get some food bargains. What a variety of fine foods and wines, cheeses etc. This is a place not to be missed, great Pubs and outside seating areas !! Enjoy !!||December 6, 2014
Globalhawk2013||50||This is one of my all time favourite places to visit in London and one of the best food markets, I have visited many times, especially as I used to work nearby. There are some excellent stalls and if looking for something to eat, try the street food, plenty of choice and options rather than the sit down restaurants in the area, which are expensive and typically overpriced in my opinion, even for London. You need to plan your visit as on some days you won't get the full market, with many of the outlets shut. End of the week and weekends are popular but very busy, if you are not eating get there early or when the lunchtime crowd are not there.||December 5, 2014
dallastexas48||50||Don't Miss! Don't Miss!!!All types of cheeses, meats, pastries, bars and restaurants. A very fun couple of hours!||December 4, 2014
Owenthomas||50||There are both prepared food and food to purchase to prepare. It is easy to spend several hours wondering around and sampling the various foods. Especially a lot of cheese. We went to get the best cheese sandwich in the world at Kappacasein and were not disappointed. That stand is located just outside the Southwark Cathedral churchyard. There are also lots of pubs and places to eat around the market. This is our favorite market in London and we go every time we visit London.||December 4, 2014

DebbieH1803||50||To call it a market would be like calling Buckingham Palace a house!We could have bought anything we wanted. It was crowded, but we were there on a Saturday afternoon.We chose to eat Ciabatta with roast pork, apple sauce, rocket and crackling. Just sublime!||December 3, 2014
chechexx||40||This market is amazing, such a vast array of foods, both to buy or to eat there. we were given lots of samples to try and came home with some tasty cheese and cured sausage from a French stall, and some authentic Turkish delight. Take a camera as the displays are definitely worth taking a picture of, and its mostly undercover.||December 3, 2014
Bigbaby2||50||This is a covered market, that's a food lovers paradise. Lots of really high end meats, cheeses, and various food for purchase stalls. Also, lots of pubs around the market.||December 3, 2014
Simon K||50||Nothing negative to say. This is a proper market unlike many one finds in other places. The range of food from various countries is stunning||December 3, 2014
VM123186338||50||I love borough market, because there are so many flavours. you can try so many cheeses, truffles, seafood and ilatian olive oil||December 3, 2014
Bread P||30||That's a very good spot to find basically many varieties of food and drinks.It is very nice also to walk around just to see different things.||December 3, 2014
desperatem0usewife||50||Lots of stalls with a very varied selection of national and international foods. Bought some lovely Chorizo Sausage from an English producer and although it was hard to choose I finally had a Salt Beef on Rye sandwich which was the best and most authentic I have had for a very long time. Definitely worth a visit.||December 3, 2014
Andy F||40||If you've never been then go - wonderful foodie paradise with so many good things to buy! Surrounded by great bars and restaurants and easy to get to.But be warned - weekends are mobbed with tourists and it is a much better mid week venue - it's a victim of it's own success - do go but be warned!||December 3, 2014
SuzanneNorthLondon||50||I love Borough Market for the total olfactory hit - it really is a delight for the senses on every level. One can sample diverse international and home grown foods by growers and suppers who are serious about food and be sure of freshness and quality as there is so much competition. As well as the plethora of stalls, there are many restaurants surrounding the market and also bakeries, Monmouth Coffee which is hard to surpass and will gladly offer advice and tastings. Also present is the fabulous Ginger Pig butchery and finally Brindisa, my favourite shops for artisan Spanish produce including the mouth watering Ibérico Bellota ham that is unrivalled.||December 3, 2014
TPatNJ||50||Amazing place with plenty of different things to eat or take home. There is British as well as international foods available here. Lunch time will get busy with workers from surrounding offices.The place is definitely upmarket and so some things are pricey. There are also a number of bars/pubs near the market.||December 2, 2014
Joyce_7t||50||The moment I walked into Borough Market I got all buzzy and excited by all the different delicious smells that were wafting towards me. There was so much to see and try at Borough Market I wish I had more time or a few more pairs of eyes to see everything. From fresh seafood, cheese and stalls selling yummy food from all over the world, Borough Market was an excellent experience; I got to try and see food that I wouldn't have otherwise even known about. The next time I'm in London I'll definitely be visiting this market again.||December 2, 2014
Angetbh||50||A really upmarket little market with covered areas, wifi et cetera but at it's heart is good quality food made from fresh and where possible local produce. Some items such as bread and fruit aren't exactly cheap compared to supermarkets or other markets but you are paying for freshness and quality. ||December 2, 2014
BobP122||50||If you like food you must visit this market.The wide choice of cheese, meats, breads, teas, etc. is amazing.The quality of everthing we tried was very high and the stall hoiders we spoke to most certainly knew what they were talking about.We visited on a sunday and it was busy.Will most certainly visit again.||November 30, 2014
SHEPHECJ||50||This is a market not to be missed and it is large. Food from round the world. Stalls selling spices,cheeses,bread,meat,fish,honey etc etc etc. First time and can't wait to revisit. Easy to get to from London Bridge UG station. Arrive hungry.||November 30, 2014
LozEvieHarry||40||Recommended by a friend so decided to pay a visit with my husband as we both love food! We were not disappointed. Easy 2min walk from London Bridge station. Walk out at the base of the Shard past All Bar One, Jamie's Bar across the road. you will see The church across the road, Borough Market is next to it. We were immediately hit by gorgeous cooking smells and couldn't wait to tuck in! Every type of cuisine from traditional pies and sausage rolls of the highest quality to all types of cultural delights, cakes, pastries, breads, cheeses, juices, condiments, meats, seafood the list is endless. My advice would be to share so that you can sample as many things as possible. My favourite was Wild boar tortellini from La Tua Pasta and a close second was a duck wrap with palm sauce but everything I had was yummy! Defo going back soon||November 30, 2014
Susan P||40||We wandered around the market for an hour or so going ooh and aah at everything, trying lots of tasters and enjoying the stalls, which were many and varied. Anything and everything edible and drinkable was on sale, and it's very up-market these days but still atmospheric and enjoyable. Not too far from other attractions either.||November 30, 2014
jcw0312||40||We visited the Borough Market on a Saturday morning and what an experience! There are all types of vendors represented and the number of people there was astonishing. We stayed for about two hours and had a wonderful time exploring the different vendors and booths. I am not sure I would go back for a second visit because of all the people and the trouble getting through the massive humanity but I am glad I did it once.||November 30, 2014
AlicePng||50||If you are a food lover and in London, do make time to visit Borough Market - a delightful food market where you can find British and international produce.There is such a wide variety of tempting food on offer that once there, it is time to indulge and forget about the waistline!The sights, the sounds, the aromas are a delight to the senses. Borough Market is only open on Wednesdays to Saturdays. Visit its website boroughmarket.org.uk for the opening hours. It can get quite crowded especially on Saturdays. To beat the Saturday crowd, best reach there by 8am as soon as it opens. We made it a point to be there at 8am on a Saturday to grab some breakfast, and had the place literally to ourselves! It was very pleasant, moving from stall to stall checking everything out. Even the seats at a corner of the market were mostly unoccupied, meaning that we could sit and eat in leisure.If time is limited, you can use the interactive Market Map on the website to better plan your visit by shortlisting the stalls/ shops you must visit.There is also a line of stalls cooking/selling Asian cuisines. We tried the Chinese Noodles served in a box and it was delicious! Everything really looked so good..from the cakes and pastries to the paella and steaks/burgers...Do go if you've the chance! Enjoy!!||November 30, 2014
IrisB92||50||Nice foodmarket to walk around, try some of the foods and just smell. It feels as if you just escaped the busy city and take a pause to have lunch||November 29, 2014
AndrzejStraupisz||50||It's possible to eat there italian pasta and prosciutto, spanish paella, english fish and chips, japanese and chinese "something, arabic lamb, american burgers and..POLISH SAUSAGE of course...everything top quality! I highly recommend to visit this place! ||November 28, 2014
ITGuyLeeds||50||This was my first visit to Borough Market but it will not be my last. We stayed in the area (at a premier inn nearby), and so arrived at the market at around 10am on a Saturday, and it was BUSY!! Despite being hectic, there's plenty of space to move around and view all the wonderful food and drinks on sale. My particular favourites were the bakery stalls - the varieties of breads were amazing - and the fruit and veg stalls, of which every one was a colourful work of art (lots of opportunities for photographers)! If you find yourself in the area, then I would strongly recommend a visit, in fact, is probably worth a visit to London just to see Borough Market!||November 27, 2014
Angel T||50||It's nice to see many local food and products here, addicted to the Raclette there! Very interesting for a Southeast Asian to visit, many interesting food to explore. There's a stall selling many craft beers from other countries. You got food, drinks, florist, and kitchen ware to check out. Definitely a must visit if you're a foodie! I usually spend an hour there, eat drink and chat. No worries if you're tired, you can rest at a larger space around the entrance. Sometimes it's very very crowded so be careful of your belongings and your kids if you're very short like my mother (155cm), everyone's pretty tall, HAHAHA. If you forget to carry your tote, there's a few stalls selling Borough Market's tote, cute and pretty print! Do grab the Borough Market zine/booklet to read about this market. There are many pubs and restaurants nearby! So, prepare enough money, make some space for your stomach and happy eating.||November 27, 2014
gailhelyar||40||Lovely stalls excellent food, something different to do in London and visit the Shard at the same time all at London Bridge Station||November 27, 2014
Kelly M||50||Great opportunity to sample some of the local and European foods! The location itself was easy to find and clean to walk through. Everyone was friendly.Definitely sample some of the local thai food, absolutely delicious!||November 26, 2014
Bdh1948||50||One of London's best "street markets'. Vendors sell the some of the freshest fruit and veg you can find. Tourists can easily buy typical English fare: cheeses; pork and game pies, and baked goods. Fabulous atmosphere and most of the market is under cover. Make sure you check what days the market is open though.||November 26, 2014
Billymeg||50||You just can't believe the range of cheese and cold meats at this market. Not only that, you can usually get a taste first but it isn't a cheap place to shop.||November 26, 2014
NYLON_nomad||40||Nice to see different stalls and shops selling fresh foods. Nice atmosphere during daytime. Might be packed on weekend though.||November 26, 2014
Michal_KTW||40||Maybe you think it's a normal market. But this place deserves such a high ranking. There you can not only buy food and interesting souvenirs, but you can also eat and drink something on the spot.||November 25, 2014
801DaveP||50||Borough Market is definitely worth a visit while you are in London. The food and drink were great, lots of choice and great tasting.||November 25, 2014
will668||40||if you are planning a visit here make sure you go with an empty stomach!!!!There is so much great smelling mouthwatering food on offer.It gets very busy and can be very cold too.The outside toilets are pretty terrible.If you are in the London Bridge area make sure you visit Borough Market||November 24, 2014
Brades1966||50||I have been to London many times (even lived there), but this was my first trip to Borough Market. What a really great place, so many interesting places, so much great food, not so many bargains, but definitely worth a few hours mooching around. Had a great time!||November 24, 2014
Terence C||40||Visited around lunch time on a Friday so was very busy with office staff getting a lunch on the run.a grat place to visit if you like to try different foods. Particularly good for deli stuff and great cheeses. Could spend a long time wandering around getting very Fat! For me, the salt beef on rye at Nana Fanny's the star,.Deliceous!||November 24, 2014
RCML||50||Borough market is not one of the places I have visited being a West London boy and not venturing to far from my manor in the early days. However I am bit more traveled these days I have even been to Manchester anyway I am sure you don't want to hear about my travels. Back to Borough Market I was in that part of London visiting my niece in Guys hospital and took a stroll after the visit the place has a real London vibe with a cosmopolitan twist all the food you could wish to buy and eat. The stalls are great and I must say the stall with the chili jam and Jamaican hot sauce is great (the name I cannot remember) and every kind of street food if you are hungry from banger's to curry etc. and stalls with the cheese, Prosciutto, wine,all sorts of meat and sea food as a bit of a foodie I love the place and I will be back there very soon. Lets not forget the restaurants lots to choose from we started with Black and Blue but that will be the subject of another review.||November 23, 2014
yingtan1||50||Absolute Favourite market in London.Love getting my fruits honey and chutney here, as well as indulging myself in the food. The duck confit, milkshakes, fish and chip, oysters, ah, they're all just so good!||November 23, 2014
UseMassTransit||50||We experienced (a much more appropriate verb than visited) Borough Market for the second time, and while we were here too early for the Christmas market that was in full swing last visit, it was still a fantastic time. There are tons of produce, bakers, cheese makers, cooked foods, exotic deserts stands mixed in with crafts and wares. We stumbled upon a cooking class where we got to witness the making of, help stir, and taste a Christmas pudding (which was a first). Easily accessible from the bus (the Hop Exchange stop). Definitely worth a visit, especially when you're hungry! Traveler's tip: Stick to the bus instead of the Tube for the best and cheapest sightseeing in London. You can use your Oyster Card and it is free on your 5th trip that day, so you can hop on and off on a whim all day long.||November 22, 2014
Deborah G||50||Borough is, and probably will forever be my favorite spot in London. It has fresh fruits, veggies, cheese, bread and meats! There are two sections, one with more of grocery area, and the other part has the food stalls where you can get any cuisine that you like ranging from pad thai and curry to corned beef. Worth going back multiple times so you can try all the different types of fresh food, baked goods and hand pressed juices! Delicious!||November 22, 2014
A K||20||i went to borough market on 20 nov 2014 from 12:00-16:00, I went to a shop named Ion patisserie (the staff is a red hair, tall and thin lady). I bought a carrot cake which costed £2.20, i gave her a £50 note and she just gave me £7.80 for the change. She insisted that is a £10 note instead of £50 and denied to show me the note I gave her. I am very upset and I am shocked this happened at one of the famous markets in the world. This totally affects the image of borough market. As a tourist, I feel not safe to go to borough market again. ||November 22, 2014
Shinoaoshi||50||Made multiple trips to Borough Market during my 1 month stay in London cause I simply could not get enough of it. We always managed to find new gems in this market and its surroundings each time we went, from the freshly shucked oysters to the wild game burgers and the very best coffee - Monmouth coffee on the outer edge of the market. The fresh produce section was also an eye-opener, with sample tastings of cured meat, parma ham and delectable cheese available for purchase. Great variety of cooked food from wild game burgers to steaming paella and the traditional fish and chips. Pleasant atmosphere overall. I do suggest walking through the entire complex before deciding to which food to purchase as there may be multiple stores offering the same kind of food.||November 21, 2014
TadiniABC||50||The best burger and brownie I've ever eaten. But there is a lot of other kind of foods like, honey, breads, cheese...||November 21, 2014
GalwayJackit||50||A very charming market bustling with food from every type of food in Britain. Pulled pork and Monmouth coffees are the best there in my opinion||November 21, 2014
Gandhi_Suryoto||40||I think food lovers from all over the world will love this place. The smell, the taste and the ambience are great. You can find pad thai (in London), pork, sweet, you name it. In the corner there's a restaurant called Fish! serves great food too. Its location is so close to other interesting spots. One more thing, there's a good coffee stall also. Heaven!||November 20, 2014

Kevo1978||50||Nom nom nom!Loads of amazing foods and themes from cheese to fish and everything inbetween.The smells are amazing as you meander through the alleyways of stalls and try not to be tempted to buy everything you lay eyes on! An excellent day out for all.||November 19, 2014
PhoebeFeedit||50||If you love farmer's markets, you'll love this one! It isn't as big as some of the other markets but it's bright and colorful with variety of different produce stalls/food stalls, many of which offer free samples! I easily spent 1-2 hours here just perusing the goods before finding a spot to sit or buying a number of yummy things as take away. Food isn't exactly cheap although most portions are plenty generous so if you want to sample a variety of items, bring some friends along for a lovely brunch/lunch. I would say this market is a must-visit :D||November 19, 2014
Ciaran B||50||No brilliant deals to be found, but lots of high quality independent stalls selling gourmet items. It can get very busy, particularly at the weekends, but it's worth a visit for a tasty lunch or a few nice items.||November 19, 2014
Si H||50||This market is a must see for food lovers. Loads of stalls providing a very wide range of cuisines.The cider stall is brilliant and the fresh fish is superb.Shellseekers oysters or dived scallops are brilliant value while the fact the actual diver runs the stall is added novelty.The market can get very busy especially on a Saturday so make a mental note of the nearest toilets or escape route if you need a breather!||November 18, 2014
316dannyb||50||Don't go on an empty stomach as you end up buying more than you planned! Take your time to get around and to sample the excellent products, but be mind full of limited places to sit and the queues at busy times. The queues are there for a reason and often worth joining if you like the products on offer. The market is not cheap but the experience is great. We had lunch and brought back some speciality breads and cheeses. Worth the money and a great way to relive the visit. I just cant work out why the cheese are so much better here than at any other cheese counter, but it is.||November 18, 2014
TogComo||50||This market has a great vibe and a fantastic selection of food and drink stalls.It tends to get very busy but this adds to the experience.We spent a lovely couple of hours wandering around. The cakes are amazing!!||November 18, 2014
kevin h||50||We called in on the Friday evening and fancied something we haven't had before. Found an Ethiopian food stand with cartons for £4.50 with about 8 choices to go with the main. Absolutely beautiful food with friendly service.A great vibrant market all in all and usually call in when we visit London.||November 18, 2014
Andrew081||50||Dating from the 13th century at its current site (1000 years in Southwark) Borough Market, although very touristy, is well worth a visit. Loads of places to buy drinks and food, or to do some food and drink shopping (keep eye out for Jamie Oliver doing his shopping!). I have had food and drink many times from the market and most of it has been very good, if not excellent, especially for street / market food.If not interested in food, drink and veg; then look out for scenes from movies e.g. Bridget Jones’s flat was above the Globe pub. You may also recognise scenes from Entrapment, Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban and many other films / movies.Try to visit Friday morning (10 to 12) or Saturday (8 to 11) to see the market at its best, but avoid Saturday from mid-day as the crowds just spoil the whole experience.||November 17, 2014
sewaterman||50||You can spend hours just wandering around & looking - stands specializing in olives or honey or spices or truffles - amazing variety & great atmosphere.||November 16, 2014
andrew1211||50||Great market mainly food based with choice for everyone. Well busy on most days hard to move at times! Still can't wait to go back.||November 16, 2014
stephen g||50||The place to source high quality food in London. The market boasts a superb selection of quality retailers selling some of the best produce available. The market is buzzy with a great atmosphere and is well worth a visit whether you are buying ingredients to take home or prepared food to eat whilst you walk round. The only down side for us is that it is 150 miles from home, and we now get depressed when we visit our local shops.||November 16, 2014
luvroma2||50||This market is a "foodies'" heaven. There are so many stands with gourmet items you cannot find anywhere else. Plus the prepared food stands are outstanding. Saturday mornings it is impossible to move because there are soooooo many people - be forewarned!!! Given there are so many places to purchase food and drinks, there are extremely limited toilet facilities. I did find two which were VERY difficult to locate due to limited signage and once found, the line was excruciatingly long. They really need to add more toilets.||November 15, 2014
Snatcher79||50||Had the lovely oysters, pies, fresh strawberries and fresh juice. Kids manage to catch a glimpse of a dead rabbit (eye opener) at a wild game stall||November 15, 2014
Hazel159||40||I came here before meeting up with some friends for dinner. There is so much to see and try. I would definitely recommend this market to anyone who has time on their hands. A brilliant place to go and I will be back.||November 15, 2014

Fromhome1||50||Quite a small market but loads of food and bars and all great quality. Choices and prices good. Great vibe.||November 13, 2014
ThomasS916||40||This is a place you should visit. Lot's of booth for food, beverages and more. Go there, take your time and test / eat at the different places. You can find a lot of creative stuff, mostly hand-made.||November 12, 2014
1946Traveler||50||Only open Friday and Saturday, this is one of the best markets I've seen (and I LOVE markets!). You won't find any tacky junk, just great local food offerings of every sort. A great variety of produce, meats, cheeses, bakery treats and also good options for lunch. We enjoyed a duck confit sandwich and pastries while strolling around, but there are also options to sit down as well.I did take some photos and no one seemed unhappy about that. If you cant get there on the open days, the Monmouth Coffee company and Neal's Yard Dairy (for a great selection of cheeses with samples and advice) are open daily.||November 12, 2014
OBX_Laynie||30||The market itself is very impressive! We were told about it by a local and I think she must go very early because we could hardly see where we were going for the crowds of people and not very courteous people. Rude & pushy and cutting in line. We only stayed about 30-40 minutes but it seemed like jail time. We managed to sample some bread, cheese & honey which we bought and enjoyed later at our hotel but New Yorkers need to come here and teach folks some manners!||November 12, 2014
Kate_boots||50||This is a place to enjoy either just wandering around soaking in the atmosphere or buying from a wonderful choice of fresh and cooked foodsSaturday afternoon it was buzzing, the coconut pancakes were wonderful and so was so much else. This is a market used by locals for their everyday shopping, it has much to offer and see, I can't recommend it enough||November 11, 2014
LondonAdrian||50||If you wanted to see the main sights in London in one day and have the best time start at Borough Street market at London bridge. The market is a bustling 'up-market' market with a fantastic choice of beautiful food from some of the best food purveyors in England. But that is just the start having bought a local burgher (a must) off you go on a walk by the river where you will see looking back the Tower of London and Tower bridge and you are underneath the magnificent Shard. You pass the Clink Museum where you can see how unfortunates were kept in chains for misdemeanors years ago, then there is the Golden Hind a perfect replica of the ship Francis Drake sailed in, onwards to the Globe the perfect reconstruction of Shakespeare's theatre, next the Tate Modern the most visited art gallery in the world (with a small diversion you can cross the 'wobbly' bridge and see St Paul's Cathedral). Then on again passing all sorts of street entertainers and you will pass the National Theatre, The British Film Institute, The Royal Festival Hall, the London Aquarium, The London Eye, from where yoiu can see the Houses of Parliament, cross Westminster Bridge and you have Westminster Abbey and a little further Buckingham Palace, then back on yourself to Trafalgar Square, and of course Covent garden. If yoiu set off from borough market early in the morning you could visit all those things WALKING in one comfortable day. You will be tired but it will be the best day in London.||November 11, 2014
VandKe||40||Spent an hour or two here whilst visiting my son in London. Thoroughly impressed. I have visited many many markets abroad and always thought it a shame that our markets didn't seem to live up to those but this is definitely the exception. Beautiful fruit and veg stalls, lovingly laid out. Great British products - meats, seafood and cheeses - as well as lovely produce from abroad. A chance to nibble your way round and sample lots of different things - we discovered white truffle oil - amazing. Would thoroughly recommend. Very busy but then good places are. Sure they would do great business if they opened on a Sunday as well ?||November 11, 2014
payalshah21||30||This market is absolutely lovely however avoid going during weekends as it gets terribly busy and crowded. Variety of food is amazing.||November 11, 2014
Sue L||50||What a wonderful clean market to visit.the stalls are selling all sorts of different products from various countries.The atmosphere is fun,friendly and very welcoming.....Tasty little samples try before you buy....a must place to visit.Right near London Bridge Station.....||November 11, 2014
Eddy26||40||If you like interesting food, go to Borough Market. It has lots of food stalls with artisan bread, burgers of all unusual meats, cheeses, sweet things, drinks - just endless. Great street food.||November 11, 2014
suzziej||50||Borough Market is situated next to Southwark Cathedral, closest tube Lonon Bridge. It is open all day Friday and Saturday morning. The range of produce here is wide. Fresh fruit and vegetables to cheeses from Britain, France & Italy. Jambon and chorizo from Spain, fresh fish, fresh meat as well as English game pies, quality sour dough breads, mushroom pate, truffles as well as truffle oils & truffle infused honey., cakes, chocolate.......The market can get very busy, especially on Saturday. Prices are high, but the experience alone is worth it. Don't miss the mushroom pate, the truffle honey, the chorizo, rocket & red pepper rolls, the Monmouth coffee shop for the best coffee in London and Neales Yard Cheese shop (down the road from the Monmouth coffee shop).Wright Bros restaurant has great oysters & seafood & wine by the glass, but is not cheap.Enjoy!||November 11, 2014
HollyBerryElf||50||Fresh produce, fresh (from the farm) meats and cheeses, breads, cookies, flowers ... just about anything can be found here -- from the ordinary to the unique (kangaroo meat, anyone?). We stop by at least once every trip to London ... we were in London 3.5-days last week, and visited Borough Market twice. Picked up some of the cutest owl cookies ... ate them on the plane coming back home. Most of the vendors seem to dislike it when people take photographs without asking (I can understand) ... but if you ask nicely, often will let you. Free to visit, but you will probably find something that calls your name and will hop right into your bags.||November 10, 2014
sashaauckland||50||Borough market is absolutely awesome. If you are a foodie GO HERE. We went for lunch, bought too much, ate too much, took things back to where we were staying and nibbled on them for days. Just too much to choose; this is not your basic farmers market! Whatever your taste you will find something here as it's a veritable smorgasbord of international foods all beautifully presented in a bustling and vibrant setting. ||November 10, 2014
HESLondon||40||If you love artisan food then this is the place to go. An overwhelming array of choice from a broad spectrum of small food producers is available. It's wonderful to wander round taking in the sights, smells and digesting what's on offer. We particularly loved Wildes Cheese, run by Philip Wilton, who is based in North London a couple of miles from where we live. He's passionate and enthusiastic about his beautiful cheeses and it's great to be able to learn first hand about your purchases. A fantastic way to while away a Saturday morning and a million miles away from your weekend supermarket shop. Be prepared to take your time as it does get busy and take advantage of the "tasters" on offer so you can try before you buy.||November 10, 2014
87pauliuss||50||I am not big fan of museums and old buildings, it's nice to see, but for me most attraction such markets, I loved it, we tried different food, we tried oysters (1.5 pound each) and home cider, we tried some indian food also. After this we walked to Tower bridge.||November 9, 2014
Edwin B||50||If you like a variety of foods and sweets, this is the place to be! You can buy almost every sort of fruits, vegetables, pastries, meats and anything you can imagine. Each stall is different from the next, and it leaves you feeling like you have to buy something from each! Well worth the visit!||November 9, 2014
Kim R||50||Staying in southwark, I walked over to the market on Saturday morning . Really busy, This market is fab, loads of cheese and bread, fresh fruit and veg. Tasted oysters for the first time and had cider and mulled wine. The smell of the different foods is amazing. You must go visit this market.||November 9, 2014
sheilallan||50||Yes some of the criticisms have some validity. It can be crowded - but this is not the market's fault surely. There is some duplication of stall types - especially cheeses - but why not if they can all make a living .Also some prices are higher than the supermarkets but are you really comparing the quality? Whether or not you go for some serious shopping, Borough Market is a worthwhile excursion for an hour or two if you are in the area, with its great selection of fruits and vegetable stalls, fish meat and cheese stalls, together with wine outlets, cakes and pastries and a wide selection of hot food from all over the world. Overall a fascinating food and drink experience, and you have The Shard,Southwark Cathedral, London Bridge, HMS Belfast and the south bank river walk close at hand.||November 9, 2014
David T||40||Bit of a gem in the centre of London. Shows London of hThe past and present. Old established small firms selling day to day necessities.||November 8, 2014
james w||50||After years of moaning that we don't have to equivalent of covered markets as in Barcelona,Valencia etc,found out we do!Only spent an hour or so but could have stayed all day and spent a fortune.Asked what I want for Xmas.............fill a bag at Borough Market! Now when are we getting one in Maidenhed?||November 8, 2014
Manfromthebubble||40||great place, pretty frantic, a amazing food stalls, great choice of so much food and so different. I almost reckon you could buy an Alligator sandwich with roasted kangaroo purée!, if that makes sense !!!||November 8, 2014
Dr_cooke||40||I had the chance to wander around this market around 0800 and again around 1100, having thus the chance to see how most of the stalls were opened and prepared. What really shocked me was how well centuries of tradition and modern food and tendencies were blended. Market layout is that of a really traditional food market, but all the stalls are actually offering modern goods in a modern display. Some seemed to offer top quality, others, just the look of it. Overal a very interesting experience, mostly because it did not seem artificial at all.PS Beware of any of the "paellas" offered. Disgusting.||November 8, 2014
Randy B||50||You can't beat going to the Borough Market on a Saturday. Free samples galore, everything fresh and amazing. Packed to the gills but everyone full of good humor. Be sure not to miss the raclette! Or the almond croissants! Can someone bring me home Turkish delight? I'm salivating just thinking about it. Take out some cash across the street and have fun - you'd be hard pressed to find a better food market anywhere else in the world.||November 7, 2014
JanetteG123||50||Ended up here yesterday by chance what a great find. Lots of yummy food and drink. Had beef curry with rice and cabbage. If I'd have been going straight home I would have bought lots of bread, cheese and pastries.||November 6, 2014
Super Dottie P||50||I love Borough Market, although I'm told it's mainly for the tourists. I could walk around for hours just staring at the fresh produce, the colours, smells and varieties. But my main reason to visit, is to eat from the food stalls. I've tried so many now and haven't had a bad meal yet. But my constant favourite is a belly pork and apple sandwich at the Roast stall, yummy!||November 6, 2014
Sue S||50||We accidently came across this market and absolutely loved them. Presentation of the stalls were excellent and the food tasted amazing.||November 6, 2014
Lois T||50||I love borough market, it is an amazing place to go to if you love good food or want to experience new kind of foods. they have a range of different foods from hog-roast, pastry stalls to stalls that sell kangaroo burgers. I really enjoy the pastry stall, everything I have got from there is really tasty, have not been let down.||November 5, 2014
Harry H||50||Borough market had a large variety of thinks to do including shopping dinning and touring. I found that the cathedral was very exiting, I especially liked the display of different items from different eras of history, I also enjoyed eating at roast the restaurant very good and had good food which is very tasty. I liked the fact Neals yard very nice and I enjoyed going to the Neals yard cheese shop||November 5, 2014
Mandy P||50||loved this place !! the smells sounds and atmosphere are just wonderful. The array of fabulous food on offer is out of this world and the quality unrivalled. Didn't know where to start with lunch so many options. really worth a visit ||November 5, 2014
Ms_Ayshe_I||50||If you consider yourself a bit of a foodie or just want an interesting setting for an outdoor lunch, I would recommend Borough Market. There is a huge selection of cheeses, breads, meats, pastries and more available to buy. If you are travelling abroad some stalls even offer to vacuum pack the goods. We like to buy 3-4 loaves of the artisan bread and freeze it at home to last us until our next visit. On my last visit, between our family of four we had fresh pasta, an ostrich burger, organic vegatable soup and a fish paella for lunch. All of it was great and if we has space to try any more of the foods on offer we would have!||November 4, 2014
Aletxas||40||You can find anything you might need for cooking an special recipe (I could find sea fennel or "Crithmum maritimum ") while you have a bite of what the different stalls offer. On Saturdays it is overcrowded, but even so I was able to try a lot of different things. I really enjoyed. But if you prefer your food on a table, you must know that there are some restaurants around too. Your choice! On Sundays it is closed, so you'll still be able to visit it, but obviously it won't be the same without the buzz of people everywhere.||November 4, 2014
RobbyK2468||50||I love this place, great location near London bridge and the Shard.. Food is the key here and there's plenty to choose from any budget... From paella to amazing fish and meat dishes... Super atmosphere and a busy but fun place to visit either couples and families alike ||November 4, 2014
Noise_Research||50||Busy and bustling food market near Southwark Cathedral and The Shard. Many artisan food producers selling original produce (bread, cheeses, spices, meats, veg, tea, coffee). Fantasticly cheap Cafe right in the centre, no frills but a cup of tea for £1 and steak sandwiches||November 4, 2014
kdoenier||40||The Borough Market is surely worth a visit and offers nice produce and a variety of food. I really liked the Jumi Cheese stall with the speciality cheese from Switzerland.||November 4, 2014
sweetpea2403||50||On a recent trip to London to see The Poppies decided after a stroll through Pudding Lane and surrounding areas to go to Borough Market. This I hasten to add was on a weekday - at the weekends have been informed it is packed!Now this is not your 'Cheap Veggie Market' but is abounding with the most delicious variety of foods. Take your time, wander and don't be afraid to ask to try something. Thoroughly recommend all UK produce especially UK Charcuterie. Cheeses also are divine. Of course it is all personal taste. The Breas which is from the Artisan Bakery there (where they also run Baking classes) is amazing and not too expensive. Worth taking a loaf, cakes or whatever takes your fancy home. Look for the stalls selling Pies, Sausage Rolls and Scotch Eggs, especially the ones with Quail Eggs. Fruit and Veg, all so attractively displayed with many exotic varieties. Must not forget the Fish with fabulous Oysters to knock back!Do eat early from the many Stalls selling food, don't dither as by 1.00 p.m. the queues are forming fast. Be aware also there are few places to perch to eat apart from the grounds of Southwark Cathedral. All in all an experience but be aware prices are high!||November 4, 2014
PhilX5||50||Love market food? Do not miss a visit to Borough market. Fresh Italian cheeses matured with different wines ( L'ubriaco) amazing! Grilled cheese sandwich or raclette cheese with potatoes and gherkins. Yum! Spanish produce and finish off with probably the best coffee in town Monmouth (seriously more'ish) if you want a doughnut then make your way to bread ahead (stall not shop) early! They sell out by early afternoon! Enjoy||November 4, 2014
Greenwhich_12||40||I work fairly near Borough Market, and quite often take this for granted. I visited recently on a Friday mid-afternoon (managed to get out of the office) and was reminded about how brilliant it is. There are so many local and UK producers / stalls and great quality food on offer, not to mention other European food. It is just a great way to celebrate good food. Yes, it can be very busy - particularly on a Saturday, so you might want to time it right, but nothing more enjoyable about wandering through, sampling some cheese and olives - then going home with your purchases wrapped in brown paper bags.||November 4, 2014
TravelFan48105||50||I go to Borough Market every time I'm in London. I can't resist wandering around the stalls, feasting my eyes on the amazing foods and sampling unusual items. There are so many choices and I've always enjoyed what I've eaten or drunk - including cheeses, apple cider, goat ice cream (fantastic and lower fat than cow's milk), fudge, spinach pie, middle eastern delights, breads and so much more. All the stall owners are helpful and take the time to explain their wares (and are usually happy to let you taste a sample). The Market gets very crowded on Saturdays, so I suggest you go early or, alternatively, try Fridays which are less frenetic. Borough Market is easy to reach on the Underground (London Bridge Station). It is definitely a London gem!||November 3, 2014
Hhnannies||50||Amazing experience. All that you need in one convenient location. The décor, the people, the atmosphere, the smells...really couldn't ask for a better shopping experience.||November 3, 2014
mark p||50||total sensory overload, too much to take In on one visit, the variety and quality of produce on offer is outstanding, such a hard decision to make , what to eat for lunch so much choice, opted for an Ethiopian dish which was excellent. The only downside was the shear numbers of visitors brought out by the unseasonably warm weather at the end of half term||November 3, 2014
jenks124||50||If you love food, this is the place for you! The only issue is the amount of choice, everything is so good you;ll be wandering around for hours!||November 3, 2014
427ccfcfan||50||Love visiting this market when in London. Getting more adventurous now and venturing into surrounding streets to seek out more outlets. Love the way little samplers of food and drink are offered and enjoy visiting Maria's market cafe in the centre for a proper market breakfast/brunch batch (bap/cop) and proper cup of hot tea. Can't wait for our next visit.||November 3, 2014
Reisender4631||40||I love Borough Market. It is a very vibrant place. I can recommend to go early in the morning to avoid most of the tourist. It is amazing to buy fresh cheese and meet and try everything before you commit.Best to start the day of with a glass of Prosecco at the entrance for 3.50 which testes amazing and then try your way around the stalls.If you need a break, there are enough pubs around to enjoy a nice glass of Aperol Spritz in the sun. Fabulous atmosphere||November 3, 2014
AntonyDP||50||I was walking on a Saturday and I got at the Borough Market. I was amazed, it's like travelling back in time. The stands, the people, the environment... Anche Absolute must see.||November 3, 2014
TheSaintys||50||A morning visit on a Saturday, probably the best thing we did during the half term hold.Go hungry and try a variety of foods and drinks. You will leave very full up and very happy!It did get very busy, but that won't put us off going again.Fabulous atmosphere, great setting, London at its best.||November 2, 2014
Andrew2608||50||What a great find during a stopover in a City I called home for many years. Now living in USA we were amazed at the friendly vibe in this amazing center of the worlds food and products. This is street food at its best and all with a warm welcome.  ||November 2, 2014
ncp150||50||What a fantastic place for a wander! Lots of unusual stalls to have a walk around, sample new things. The choice of food is amazing, plus there are lots of food stalls to have lunch or a bite to eat. On Saturday they have prosseco stands...a glass for £3.95! You can check out the stalls whilst enjoying a drink! Loved it! ||November 2, 2014
Ann-Marie E||50||I decided to take my daughter here for lunch before making our way to Tower Bridge for the Poppies. There was so much choice she found it hard to decide but we both ended up getting a freshly made burger with all the bits. Pudding for for her was a Chocolate Fudge Brownie. I didnt hear a peep out of her while she demolished. If I Iived in London I would be making this market a regular haunt for sure.||November 2, 2014
hgarbin||40||Beside the beautiful Southwark Cathedral you will find the Borough Market, in fact, you will find it first though the wonderful and mixed flavours that emenate from. Plan to arrive there around lunch, there are multiple delicious options. From there, you can start a great walk through South Bank with its atractions.||November 2, 2014
Catie B||30||We went around 10.30am as we'd taken the advice to go before lunchtime- it was just too busy, you couldn't get near any of the stalls as there were too many people stood around them.||November 2, 2014
mhirst||50||The variety of street food is unbelievable, we had wild boar sausage but I am convinced you could find every kind of food on the planet in the market, stopped in for a quick lunch while visiting the tower. The smells are incredible, you have to go.||November 2, 2014
Angela R||40||I haven't been to Borough Market for ages, but as I was in the area and it was a sunny day, I thought why not?There's lots of stalls with savoury - Thai, Spanish etc., and sweet smells - fresh artisan bread, cakes, chocolates and more fighting for space, plus opportunities to taste lots of products. I bought some chocolate nuts, raisins and sweet cashew nuts (delicious!)If you're eating on the move or a tourist - it's well-worth a visit!||November 2, 2014
Cardiboy||40||Visited for lunch on a Monday so the market was a bit quieter than at the weekend and several stalls were closed. Nevertheless the market was still bustling and there was a wide variety of choice to cater for the majority of tastes.Apart from all the street food stalls there are plenty of bread, cake, meat and cheese outlets a visit gives a great opportunity to stock up on local and continental produce not seen in your local supermarkets.||November 2, 2014
Rozrob||50||We went there early Saturday morning, it was busy but the variety of food was wonderful. I had two oysters (From field to Fork stall) 2 for £3 which was delicious followed an Ethiopian dish as brunch which we sat outside and ate. It was delicious. My friend had a venison burger, which she said too was delicious. Variety of delicious cheeses and the best black pudding (Scottish Highland wild boar stand) I have ever tasted. There is a stall that sells Alps biltong, which I had a taste of but I did not personally like it. I love Biltong just not this. Not sure if they use the SA recipe to make it. It was truly a wonderful morning and it was a great day to spend a few hours!||November 2, 2014
AllieTravels||50||Just the most amazing market to see smell and taste every food you could want. Don't miss this gem it blew my mind. Loved it. Had brunch in Radot on the mezzanine ovoverlooking the bustle below us. Great spot for people watching.||November 1, 2014
Psamob||40||After a lovely visit to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre and a stop at Southwark Cathedral where Chaucer's Canterbury pilgrims began their pilgrimage, we stopped for lunch at the Borough market.We found a fascinating conglomerate of eateries. It was great fun to stop and use our senses to enjoy the colorful sights, cacophony, and smells of many different types of foods. We settled for small, piping hot traditional British meat pies. They were delicious.We wandered to the area of the real meat and fish market. However, after early morning, most of the mercantile work was done. It would have been more interesting if we had visited about 7 AM or 8 AM.Nonetheless, it was well worth the visit. The market is easily accessible by tube.||November 1, 2014
Carrie C||50||It was a bit busy but the great variety and quality of food were well worth the hustle and bustle.I would highly recommend a visit to anyone.We walked to Covent Garden afterwards which was a really great alternative to the underground and the views made it well worth it.||November 1, 2014
MarinaLussich||50||Head nice and early any Saturday to Borough Market. You will not be disappointed! Grab some bread, cheese from the stalls and sit at the wine bar with a bottle to watch the crowd and maybe even spot a celebrity or two.||November 1, 2014
Edster88||40||I came across this wonderful market trying to walk from Monument to Shakespeare's Glove Theatre. It is an amazing with many boutique producers from pork pies to cheeses to partridge in a pot pate and everything in between. The smells and variety are very welcoming. You will even find seafood, game meat, freshly shucked oysters, fruit vegetables and so on. A real local experience open Wednesday to Saturday I would highly recommend it you had the opportunity. ||November 1, 2014
DeeJ942||50||This year is the Market's 1,000 year anniversary - not many places can claim that length of service! It is fantastic for all sorts of food - spices, cheese, fresh fruit and veg, fish, meats - you want it? it'll be here somewhere! The atmosphere is great and for lunch there are great bubbling cauldrons of delicious things to tempt the nostrils and tongue. (Or nip into the George Inn just off of the High Street - it's a coaching Inn which has been there since 15 - something. The current building dates from 1677 and has been in continuous use ever since.)Handy to mix with seeing Southwark Cathedral and The Shard. A fascinating area which combines the ancient with the very new and does it quite well.||November 1, 2014
ALandVICTORIA||40||We stopped by this market on a recent trip to London and we're pleased with what we found. Lots of choice. My wife was particularly pleased with the selection of cake stalls there were. We only bought a one cake as we were staying in a hotel and out for the rest of the day. Nevertheless, the cake was delicious. ||November 1, 2014
MlfDuran||30||The market is tiny so you don't spend much time to visit. Go in the morning to eat breakfast, or for lunch. It has a little of everything, including local fruits (many berries) and other parts of the world.||November 1, 2014
G7056BNjamesm||50||Haven't been here for a long time and ended up spending a lot longer here as there was such a varied selection of good quality food to try and buy.If you like food this is well worth a visit and you could spend a fortune with all this lovely food around you.||November 1, 2014
chefy123456||50||We always head to Borough market on our visits to London and we are never disappointed. It is a delight for all the senses and well worth a visit, I could spend hours going round the stalls just soaking up that foodie buzz. Great way to while away the morning.||October 31, 2014
Yusa17||50||The Borough Market is really a food market for my taste! It' s crowded like a good market tends to be. My highlights were Le Marché du quartier in wich i ate a most delicious confit duck sandwich and Spice Mountain, a world of spices, in wich i got great advice and help.You can have excellent pint in nearby pubs The Rake and Market Porter.Very near to London Bridge tube station.||October 31, 2014
J0jiM||50||I've been here twice, and both were in the morning (8-9am) so it was not at all crowded. However don't go too early (at 8am) as most stalls wouldn't have opened yet.I enjoyed walking around and looking at the variety of things they sold. It's a food haven! However, it was too pricey for me (a student visiting from Singapore) so I didn't buy that much. It's still definitely worth a visit!The milk stall (I think it's called the Moo Man), however, was excellent!||October 31, 2014
Mogovv||50||This was my second visit, and I was even more impressed. We got to try some real street food in London. To me this is a super fancy version of our Crawford Market back in Bombay. Love all the different outlets and all the fancy food one can buy. Great coffee at Monmouth and many good eateries. ||October 30, 2014
davec06||50||Visited on a Wednesday lunchtime, excellent experience, lots to view, and thanks to the italian pasta guys, for knocking us up a plate to try of three diffrent raviolis, just excellent.WE have just had a fine tea, of Palma ham, tiny orage tomatos, and Ravioli, all purchased from the market vendors, just fab, well done, we will be back.||October 30, 2014

fulltimeholidayer||50||You cannot not love Borough Market, just a few steps away from London Bridge station it's well worth a visit. It's a traditional style market selling meat, fish, veg etc but also packed with new and different foody products to buy and try. Go hungry and take plenty of people to help you carry everything you'll want to buy! Lots of traditional pubs nearby too.||October 29, 2014
minimaid||50||Very close to London Bridge a market not to be missed. Whatever you fancy to eat is bound to be here.

Loulou6264||50||This market is bursting with stalls with food from all over the world! The smell as you walk around is wonderful...from meats, cheeses and savouries to the most wonderful cakes and desserts! restaurants and cafes within the market added to this atmosphere...||October 29, 2014
MrsMichy||50||Only a few minutes walk from London Bridge and a MUST before you set off on your sightseeing! My past visits have been Saturday mornings when the market is packed, but today (Tuesday) we called in about 2.30 p.m. and it was interesting to just wander around the market at ease. The smell of different foods is amazing and you are spoilt for choice. Having been to various food markets around the world the one in my own home city is probably the best I have visited.||October 28, 2014
louise i||40||Food glorious food, wish i'd gone here when i was hungry!! Every stall had fresh beautiful food, cakes bigger than I've ever seen and everything smelt divine, as i would expect in a big city somewhere to get your teeth into whilst on the move.||October 28, 2014

Close to London Bridge station so easy to get to. It's an interesting walk from there to the Millenium Bridge and across to the St Paul's area.||October 28, 2014
ascotdame||50||Great place in London to come and wander, eat, drink and be merry. Great in door and out door market, good for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Coffee is my fave!||October 28, 2014
Lynne M||50||A brilliant place to wander around and get some lunch. High quality food stalls with great bread, cheeses, oils, fish, patisserie etc. Great range of sit down or take away food from oysters to paella to veggie burgers. Loved it!||October 28, 2014
Karen R||50||We stumbled upon this market on our way to Southwark Cathedral and experience some really tasty and delicious street food. Has a great atmosphere||October 27, 2014
Derek K||30||This market was absolutely heaving, couldn't get around because of all the people, very difficult to get near the stalls. We could see it was good, great for foodies, but either go very early on a Saturday or a different day of the week. ||October 27, 2014
KevinP6||50||Went on Friday the 24th October. there is a great amount of food choices that you can have. Very busy tho as you would expect but it is a great place to check out. ||October 26, 2014
yoongwend||40||Went on a saturday late morning, the market was already full of people!So much variety of food, worth a visit! Many stalls let you try it out as well, you can easily spend up to 2 to 3 hours there!||October 26, 2014
NikBie||50||This has to be the best market we have been too, anywhere, even better than Pike Place in Seattle. Sure its crowded but its supposed to be, that's part of it, its a bustling market - just go with it. The range of food is really good and all the traders know their business better than anyone. There are also some really good restaurants around the market that are definitely worth checking out.||October 26, 2014
David D||40||Friday 24th October, we walked through Borough Market, this place is great. There are all types of food stalls and the smell of all the wonderful food being cooked is an invitation to eat some delicious food.Further inside the market there are so many other stalls selling such a wide range of food stuff, olive oil, cheese, bread, vegetables and so much more.So worth a visit and spend some time walking around the stalls a number of them provide a sample to taste of their goods on sale.||October 26, 2014
purpleTerry||50||I love this market as it is full of interesting food stalls. It is a great place to come if, like me, you've just missed your half-hourly train out of London Bridge station. This time I bought some Italian smoked sausage, mushrooms and fresh pasta so dinner was easy to make when I got home. It is also a great place to just wander and look or grab something to eat from the street food stalls.||October 26, 2014
angiedean85||40||Went on a Saturday at midday... FULL of people!!! You have every type of food you can possibly imagine!! Great plan but must have some patience for slow moving mobs of people!||October 25, 2014
jools011||50||Absolutely fantastic. So many good foods to but including street foods. Market itself a little expensive also touristy but great to see everything.||October 25, 2014
Angelika K||50||We cane to Borough Market quite late when it was already closing up, but a few places were still open, including a small, super-small place which served oysters, nothing else. We bought some mulled wine at a nieghbouring kiosk, and enjoyed the freshes oysters. Wish we had come earlier to check out the place when everything was open.||October 25, 2014
ramgriggs||50||This food market is a local excellence to London! 1000 years on and it is still standing strong, strengthening its international trade. Take a visit here - www.roots2routes.wordpress.com/2014/10/25/borough-market-london/- and then head straight to Borough!||October 25, 2014
UYALP||50||I love this place! Best idea for Saturday lunch time... I am writing while enjoying my duck confit and a bottle of rioja... Oh very comfortable we are, sitting on a pavement . Paella, chorizo, blue cheese burger are also delicious.. Just get yourself to Borough Market and you will find your way! :))||October 25, 2014
Nikk9392||50||This market should be on everyone's to do list! There is a vast array of fresh produce everywhere you look, many of the stalls will let you try before you buy too! Plan to spend a couple of hours and have lunch whilst you're there. If I lived closer it'd be a weekly trip! I personally think this is far better than other food markets in the UK!||October 25, 2014
rse13nr||50||THE MOST FABULOUS place to eat! WONDERFUL selection of foods from many places to cater for many many tastes. Lots of one-off stalls, with superb staff serving you straight away. Savoury and sweet, carnivore and veggie, familiar and exotic - fantastic sights, smells, flavours. Very affordable - not very resistible. Brilliant atmosphere, in the shadow of Southwark Cathedral and very near the Golden Hinde. Highly recommended!||October 24, 2014
Frankbiern||50||We first heard of Borough Market courtesy of Ina Garten, the" Barefoot Contessa". She has a cooking show in the US and had a one hour special about London and all the places she enjoys. We followed her many suggestions, but hands down Borough Market was the place we most enjoyed. In fact, this was our 3rd time to visit and while things had moved around a bit, it did not disappoint. It's so much fun to wander around the stalls filled with fresh baked breads, cookies and candies. Not to mention the cheeses and the sausages, the jellies and juices, the nuts and paellas steaming in huge vats. Oh and the chocolate in all flavors shapes and sizes. This place is a foodies delight. Can't wait until our next visit. The full market is open Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. There are some permanent stalls that are open on other days of the week.||October 24, 2014
Vinogal1||50||I love food. But where else can you get duck confit sandwiches, The BEST grilled cheese sandwiches in the world, jars of potted goose, bramble berry jam, stunning home made cheeses, chocolate, beautiful vegetables, gorgeous meats in one place? And one of the least expensive, tastiest dinners in London. My first.. and last stop in London whenever I am there. ||October 23, 2014
Sral2214||50||Borough Market is great. It's got a great atmosphere, a cool setting, and lots of great food. It's really busy, and sometimes I felt like I had travelled back in time. Be sure to try some of the delicious food!||October 23, 2014
axs666||30||Pro tip - the market has open hours, entrances are locked in the evenings. This is nice farmer-type market, and it's covered! Great for wandering when it's raining. Plus a smattering of nice local places to eat.||October 22, 2014
Priors10||50||Absolutely amazing market. Delicious food as far as the eye can see and something for everyone. An absolute must visit for anyone visiting London. (And that's coming from a Londoner!) Make sure you visit both sides of the market - where you can eat and also the posher stalls with the beautiful displays.||October 22, 2014
stevenandmandy||50||We always visit borough market when we are in London. The variety and quality of produce on offer is second to none, if only we had markets like this elsewhere we'd never need to darken the door of a supermarket again! Fruit, veg, meat, game, beer, wine, cheese and various preserves as well as numerous street food stalls, pubs and restaurants make Borough market the place to go if you want a gastronomic day out.||October 21, 2014
735PLR||50||I real love this market, it's often twinned with the Boqueria market in Barcelona it's not at all like a traditional market, the food stalls are vast and offer such culinary delights from around the world from breads, meats, ready meals to eat along the way. This market is a 1000 years old this year and I'm sure will be here in another 1000! Great chance to visit such colourful displays, great to be able to taste everything before you buy too.||October 21, 2014
Ronan M||50||If you love food and love life make this part of a London visit. Try Hobbs for the most amazing bbq pulled pork sandwich in town. Check prices as you wander around as the variance can be double. Beautiful fresh ingredients by artisans is available for all palates. A great morning in the heart of London.||October 21, 2014
JayPeaSee||50||Wow, Wow, Wow. This was a truly spectacular find. I have wanted to visit this market for years and never got round to doing so. We visited on Saturday and were met by loads of street food stalls - every nationality you could think of - selling the most appetizing smelling food you can imagine - some things I had never seen before in my life. We then went into the inside market where the permanent stalls were. Again there was such a huge choice of food, drink etc. One minute we were in Spain, the next minute in Turkey. There was a stall selling Prosecco and Kir Royales by the glass, paella pots sizzling away, gooey fresh mozzarella cheeses and spices from all round the world. Prices were surprisingly reasonable and if I had not been staying in London overnight I would have bought a lot more than I did. This is a real food lovers paradise.||October 21, 2014
IanW911||40||Pretty much stumbled on the market, meeting some friends for a beer near London Bridge last Saturday lunch time before football. Really busy vibrant market, , plenty of places to eat and have a drink. Ideal for visit around lunch time before or after visiting the shard . Will definately go back!||October 20, 2014
SanFranciscoGuy634||50||Wow. Wow. Wow again. What a great place. Food stalls of all types. Small restaurants selling what's in the stalls and more. All sorts of cuisines are represented. Imagine, a stall totally devoted to truffles and mushrooms. Gasp. Wow. I overloaded - and that was on a day when many stalls were closed. Imagine when they all are open! Bread. Fish. Meats. Veggies. If you can't find it here, well, it may not be worth finding. It's easy to locate. Just take the Tube to London Bridge and you'll find it right next to the small cathedral, which really is more like a church but then Shakespeare lived nearby so it has real history and perhaps enjoyed an upgrade. Alas, Shakespeare probably didn't have the benefit of the Borough Market. If he had been able to shop there, he might have spent more time eating and less time writing. That wouldn't have been good for the rest of us. Fortunately, Borough Market is open now. What are you waiting for????||October 20, 2014
nikif716||50||Global food set out in a market under a trainline. What's not to love. If you can't find food and drink you like here you might be dead.||October 20, 2014
Cypress L||50||I always go to markets like this. Yeah, they're pretty much the same around the world. But you know what? They're still fantastic. Borough Market is a classic example of a great food market. There is a huge variety of cuisines and different treats for sale, it was almost overwhelming. If you love food, and quite frankly, affordable, quality food, you shouldn't miss this market. Plus, it's covered, so you don't need to worry about the ever-present rain.||October 20, 2014
JAC2109||40||Think there's just about something for everyone. Loads to feast your eyes upon...and taste buds...your senses are alive everywhere you turn. Artisan breads, cheeses, spices, fish, fruit and veg etc. with street food available to purchase for snacks. Lots of tourists taking photos which can be frustrating. Prices possibly a bit high and not somewhere you'd necessarily shop everyday but a lovely experience and somewhere to see completely different foods.||October 19, 2014
SharonBrighton||50||If you are a food lover then look no further... Saturday brunch is a must - what to have now there is a difficult question; so much to chose from you will have to just come again and again...||October 19, 2014
philippam2006||50||I loved this market, it's not at all like a traditional market selling your every day rubbish. The food stalls are incredible and its great to be able to taste everything before you buy.||October 19, 2014
smileysylv||50||If you like food this is the place to go. Lots of sampling, and all home made produce. Stall holders took time to speak to you. We went at 11.00am and it was just getting busy||October 19, 2014
Steve A||30||I had very high hopes for wanting to see Borough Market, but the crowds Jostling and pushing spoilt the whole effect, I would say visiting on a week day would be a lot better, from what my wife and i could see, their were some excellent stalls selling the very freshest of produce, in both vegetables, cheeses etc and take away food. we would definatly go back but never on a Saturday.||October 19, 2014
wal_on_hol||30||As tourists, we were a little underwhelmed by the Borough Markets after reading all the hype. While there are lots of fabulous displays to see – vegetables, cheeses, breads, cakes, flowers – I couldn’t help but wonder if the vendors get frustrated by tourists taking photos and getting in the way of actual customers. I can see how this place is wonderful if you live locally or are staying nearby. We were there at around 10:30am on a Thursday morning. It was busy but not crowded. We had a stroller with us for our four-year-old, which was okay to push around. Between us, we bought some fudge, cakes, ice-cream and hot roast rolls for immediate consumption. We couldn’t really buy much ahead for dinner as we would have had to carry it sightseeing with us all day. I did wonder about some of the vendors’ hygiene in wearing gloves but then handling food and money in the same gloved hand. We had trouble finding something plain and healthy to suit our four-year-old son for lunch.There are lots of other things worth seeing in the London Bridge tube station area (The Shard, Tower Bridge, Southwark Cathedral, Golden Hinde, Tate Modern ) which could be worth combining with a quick look at the Borough Markets, but I wouldn’t identify the markets as a “must see” tourist destination in its own right. If you do go, keep an eye out for The Globe building which was ‘Bridget Jones’ apartment in the movies – it’s near the main entrance to the markets.||October 18, 2014
Janine W||50||Fresh cheeses, charcuterie, fish, meats, spices, breads, biscuits - the list is endless! And prior to entering, an avenue of bars serving an equally diverse selection of foods - from huge pans of paellas to fish and chips and burgers! It's well worth the 'cattle march' and jostle through the crowds to attain these hidden delights beneath the rumbles of London Bridge overground and underground stations!||October 18, 2014
Cocksy43||40||Great variety of foods on offer, both hot & cold. A number of stalls specialising in regional produce, plus fresh fruit & veg., exotics (Emu), fish, cheeses, cider & moreGo when you're hungry - you won't be disappointed.You'll need to keep going back to try a little of everything that appeals to you..||October 18, 2014
Hannover9600||40||The range of food products was amazing. One can purchase food to eat on site and there are more specialist cafés within the broader complex. Crowds were at saturation so it was a slow visit.  Southwalk Cathedral is adjacent and should be visited.||October 17, 2014
WanderingGourmand||50||this is the highlight of any visit to London for me, and it never disappoints - the service at the various stalls is uniformly good, and enthusiastica pity that the washroom are ghastly||October 17, 2014
142cs||50||I go to Borough Market every time I visit London. It has great food, even if you're just looking. Great place to grab something to eat. The only downside is that its always crowded. ||October 17, 2014
Joey G||50||This has an amazing atmosphere, great food, and great selection of things to buy. They have guys shucking oysters, you can get amazing cheese's or meats, or just about anything else you can think of. By far the coolest outdoor farmers market type thing I've ever been to.||October 17, 2014
jean c||50||It has been a long time since I last visited Borough Market and it has changed. It is much more up-market (excuse the pun) with French, Italian, Spanish outlets as well as fresh cakes, wide variety of cheese, pate etc., etc., Also, there are many tasters for people to enjoy as they walk around the market.The market also has quality plants for sale and is flanked by bars, cafes and restaurants.People can also purchase and enjoy hot food - freshly prepared - from all over the world. There is something for everyone from English to Indian food.I visited on a Thursday just after mid-day and it was bustling and certainly a lively tourist area. There were even stalls selling Borough Market items. A good couple of hours can be spent in and around this market especially as it is undercover - so perfect for a rainy day visit.||October 17, 2014
GourmandV||50||The variety of food to eat for brunch or lunch was surprising and delicious. Loved the fresh oysters, cheeses and seasonal vegetables and fruits available. The breads and desserts were incredible too. Very reasonable prices and lots of variety overall. Very enjoyable place to visit and shop. If I lived in London I would visit every week!||October 16, 2014
Chubbychubs||40||Have been using Borough Market for years but recently it's grown in size in a big way. You'll find some interesting, obscure buts and pieces here but on picking when to visit, choose carefully. It can be so busy that you just don't get to enjoy it. Here are my top tips:-1/ get there at about 4.45. Yes, it's later but there will be far fewer people about, so you'll get to see more of it.2/ visit Neals Yard cheese shop. You'll love it!3/ grab a glass of something unusual at The Wine Pantry.4/ go and have a look around the Paul Smith shop. It's like stepping back in time by 50 years. Wonderful!5/ visit Borough Kitchen, just too cool for school.6/ taste, taste and more taste. The key to Borough Market is the opportunity to sample all the delicious wares on offer.7/ if you have any room left, finish off with something to eat at any of the number of great little eateries dotted around the market.Have a wonderful time!||October 16, 2014
Carol A||50||Foodie treasure trove. Place to have fun and try new foods and drinks. Such a delight to see fruits and vegetables in all their colours and shapes and sizes - some familiar others exotic seeming. Among others things we bought mixed mushrooms and asked for advice from nice Irish sounding lady. All the stall holders know their stuff and will help you but won't overwhelm you. A feast for the senses. Trains overhead sound like drum beats adding to the theatre of this market.||October 16, 2014
MisterCreosote||40||Borough food market has a somewhat overwhelming choice of food stalls to choose from, you can buy everything from speciality cheeses, craft beers, meat, fruit and vegetables to german sausages freshly prepared, indian dishes, burgers, cakes you name it. The market has been discovered by every guide book available to mankind and is crowded with tourists and office workers alike, so suffers from overcrowding and having bought your food the hunt is on for a place to sit - there are benches but too few and in a somewhat un-alluring corner of the market. Hygiene-wise things look OK, but as always with these markets things are a little haphazard and leave a little to be desired at times (ie handling food and money at the same time).Having said that I´ve been there a few times now and never been unwell, it´s well worth a visit and there are some really unusual things to eat. If you prefer your lunch sitting down at a table then go just to look and buy food to eat later.||October 15, 2014
todd p||50||Don't miss it while walking the city. Have lunch before you go to the Tower. There are some great outdoor merchants and restaurants. Enjoy the Eye. :)||October 14, 2014
Pat L||50||We visited Borough Market, by accident, for lunch when we were walking in the area. There were lots of vendors of cheese, sausage, fudge, etc. who were very generous with samples of their delicious wares. It was a wonderful experience to have all these taste tests. The toughest decision was making a choice of what to have for lunch as there were so many choices. We noted line ups at most of them testifying to the quality as there appeared to be many local business people buying their lunch here. This is a terrific place just to wander around in the somewhat festive atmosphere where you can spend a short time or a few hours. Don't miss it when you are on the Southbank.||October 14, 2014
Rena77uk||50||Could spend a day here, tasting all the fabulous food on offer. Go around lunch time and have a feast on the samples before deciding what you actually want to buy. The pistachio financiers live up to their good reputation, delicious. Only thing lacking was much seating if you weren't eating in a particular café, but there's something very London-esque about sitting on the pavement tucking into your grub whilst being mindful of the pigeons overhead. Don't know why I haven' been before, will be back next time I'm in town!||October 14, 2014
ratogras||50||We stumbled across this market by mistake but i could not believe how vibrant and amazing all the stalls were.It was my idea of a perfect hustly bustly market place with so many people and characters.This is definately a place i would go to again and go with an empty stomach due to the fact that the stalls have every type of food and drink you could ask for!||October 14, 2014
Halperin||50||A one-stop-shop for cheese, wine, food, and gifts for family and friends. In the wintertime it's got an incredibly festive feeling that is only enhanced by the delicious smells emanating from every vendor's stand. Grab a coffee at Monmouth and then just wander through the stalls. Easily one of our favorite places in London and worth a revisit time and time again.||October 13, 2014
wanderingomnivore||50||A true foodie market. From the street food vendors to seasonal fruit and veg this place has it all. Yes, it gets busy - but it is worth it! There is so much to see, taste, and feast on. Your senses are overwhelmed from the moment you walk in. It's great for both tourists and locals. If your in a hotel you can eat at the market or take lots of exquisite 'pickey' foods back to your room - no kitchen necessary. The market is surrounded by great pubs and there are stalls inside selling seasonal drinks. You get a real sense of London's history at Borough Market, even with all of the modern stalls it still feels like a thriving epicentre of gastronomic delight which feeds hungry locals with fresh quality produce.Visiting the market is a quintessential London experience. One of the best parts of the experience is talking to the stall holders about their food. They will always take the time to tell you about where the food came from, their tips, and they love to share a secret or two about the best thing they have to offer.Best time to visit the market on a Saturday is just after opening or just before closing. The crowds are at their lowest just after opening. You can grab a coffee from one of the great cafes surrounding the market and then browse through the stalls to you hearts content. If you go just before closing some of the stalls will have sold out of their best produce, but many will be trying to get rid of what they can not store without it spoiling as the Market is closed on Sundays and many stall holders wont reopen until Wednesday or Thursday. So you can find some real bargains. If you want to experience the market at it's best, Friday afternoons see all the stalls open but without big crowds.Verdict? This is a London must visit attraction!||October 12, 2014
Scott F||50||Wow! Loved borough market, the sights, the smells, the tastes. Amazing foods. The kind of place you could go to every week and find something new. Loved Maria cafe. Finished with fantastic salt beef sandwich from northfield farm. Definitely going back||October 10, 2014
Reba N||50||This is one of the things that I miss most about my trip to London. I often wish that I had a market like this close to my neighborhood. It had so many delicious, fresh food options. I was overwhelmed with options, but fortunately my group of four all tried different things then shared a smorgasbord. Don't forget to grab a pitcher of the delicious sangrias! Great place to meet friends and experience a lively atmosphere! ||October 10, 2014
Trotpeg||40||Went here on a Saturday around noon, and it is so crowded that it is very difficult to walk around and to spend any time really looking at what each booth has to offer. Patience will pay off, however, because the offering at the various stall are really wonderful. We had a pork belly sandwich at Roast to Go that was worth negotiating the crowds!||October 10, 2014
Eva W||30||Overall experience is good and i will definitely be back to get some fresh produce like fruit and vege from there. They do have a stall selling Roast pork with apple sauce but its about 6 pounds with a small portion. Another stall selling thai seafood and chicken curry rice at 5 pounds. Pretty pricey. This place is mainly just tourist attraction and get the feel of how is like to shop at a high-class market.||October 10, 2014
nidhim||30||It was interesting to see something similar to a farmer's market with variety of fresh produce, different kind of food options that were freshly prepared. Its a paradise for a foodie like me.It can get 'very' crowded so if you do not like noisy brimming with people places, then its not for you.Also, very limited seating options are available so I ended up eating while standing.||October 9, 2014
DocHarrisHHI||50||Left the Shard and was walking towards the Millennium Bridge when we stumbled into the Borough Outdoor Market. A wonderful collection of stalls selling breads, cheeses, meats, sweets and on and on ... Also many stands selling prepared food for eating there or take home. Everything was fresh and tasty and people very friendly. The best treat was a cheese and olive baguette, fresh made, consumed as we visited the stalls.||October 9, 2014
JLB47||50||Based on a recommendation from a local foodie, I walked to Borough Market. I'm so glad I did. I walked around a bit to get the lay of the land before I planned to buy lunch. In the middle of the market, I saw a small stand selling Prosecco. A market where I can walk around with Prosecco--how are other places not stealing this idea? My first course was a savory beef empanada with a flaky crust. Delicious! With my second Prosecco (obviously I was loving this tradition), I enjoyed a chicken and sweet potato curry over rice. So flavorful! After a bit more walking, I found Greedy Goat Ice Cream and treated myself to the Salted Caramel, which was heavenly. I loved seeing all the other foods, including crocodile and zebra burger patties, three different colors of cauliflower, and many other delicacies. I treated myself to white truffle oil as a souvenir, which was flavorful but not overwhelming. There was even a section that had music playing for entertainment. Yes, it was crowded. What market isn't? Next time I'm in London, I'll be sure to visit again.||October 8, 2014
ronniefadge||50||Loved all the different stalls .went mid week so not all open, but then it was quieter.Something for every one we all eat.||October 8, 2014
719in||30||I visited this place with my girlfriend a few days ago. The primary target was to make some pictures and try some local and simple food. What I suspected become reality. I found a lot of food, and most of all non British. There were cheese, meat, bread, sausages and the candies (these were British, because I couldn't swallow it ;P ). I tried roasted meat, and potatoes with melted yellow cheese topped with mini-cucumbers. Around the market you can find a lot of bars and wine shops. It is worth to search some of them located more than several meters from the market (These were overcrowded). There were many occasions to have good shots of food and happy people with the camera. Please do remember to take a rain coat, umbrella or swimming costume (for those who like more extreme adventures). Definitely I was not disappointed, but I've been to so many nicest places that this particular market wasn't anything with "wow" factor.||October 7, 2014
myvitriol||50||The smells.....the sights.....the choice....all fantastic. One of the very best places to buy fresh seasonal food. ||October 6, 2014
martinspurs||50||Went on a Friday around 15. A bit crowded, but nevertheless an absolute joy if you are passionate about fresh ingredients and a unique variety. We opted for wild hog with an excellent apple sauce and an Etiopian combo. You can find a great lunch or exactly any kind of vegetables, cheese, meat or desserts you want here. Open from Thursday to Sunday. If you are looking for a bargain it's recommendable to arrive in the closing hours to get a bargain deal. My favourite London market. The only downfall is that you can't have it all (the dishes).||October 6, 2014
fridaygirl321||40||This is a great market to meander around seeing, smelling and tasting all the different foods from across the world. The range of food is amazing, from cheeses and bread to cakes and pastries with many other meat and fish dishes in between. Plus there is the added bonus of great wines and beers locally plus excellent coffee.Highly recommended place to visit||October 5, 2014
StelucLive||50||Get to the market on a Saturday morning and enjoy all manner of fresh food and drink stalls. Artisan producers of chocolate, breads, cheese and meats, fish stalls, fresh veg, hot food from paella to curry to street food like falafel, burgers etc. Close to London Bridge station, packed with high quality produce to sample and buy. It's usually packed with people too so be prepared to rub shoulders with other keen shoppers. Don't eat breakfast at home, grab it in the market. Not open on Sundays though. A must see.||October 5, 2014
Jingle05||50||You can smell the glories of the Borough market long before seeing it. Quality, choice, freshness. Artisan breads, cheeses, wines. Lobster and crab. Shops and stalls. Hot street food. Atmosphere. Off the beaten track but well worth the search. Go go go!!!||October 5, 2014
Rob007Kent_UK||50||My partner and I visited the market in advance of a trip to the Shard. It offers an amazing array of sights and smells and is a haven for an incredible choice of good quality food. We visited on a Saturday lunchtime and the market was packed with Londoners and tourists. The stall holders are from all over the country and include fish, meats, vegetables, ciders, cheeses, breads, coffees, cakes and patisseries. The hustle and bustle and vibe of this market is great. Well worth a visit and next time we will be buying more to take home with us !||October 5, 2014
chetochip||40||located just south of the Thames, Borough Market is a great spot to graze your way through a Saturday morning/afternoon. Myriad stands serving every kind of food you can imagine, wines, beers, even a Monmouth Coffee stand to keep you moving (highly recommended - fantastic coffee!) You can eat there or shop to take home with you.. recommend going early because it gets absolutely packed, but fun spot to take out of towners on a nice day. If you need a break, the George Inn, just across the way, is a historic old pub with a great little courtyard for a post lunch pint. Start with Monmouth, graze until you're full, and then hit the George to wind down before heading out.... solid way to spend a half day.||October 4, 2014
ashsem||50||I truly cannot believe I had never been to this market. It is a bit hard to find if you've never been, but TOTALLY worth the hunt. Plenty of ready-to-eat street food stalls and even more take home breads, pastries, cheese, meats, etc. I loved the vibe and the food. I would recommend coming on a weekday--I've read that weekends are insane, and I believe it. We came fairly late in the afternoon on a Wednesday and it was still quite crowded.||October 4, 2014
fionah961||50||As lovers of markets and food, we loved this market. It was hard to resist buying everything, but unfortunately we couldn't eat as much as we wanted to buy.If you like markets, you will want to visit borough. It is very central, has great produce, and people (characters)||October 3, 2014
Maria K||50||If you're a foodie like myself then you will really enjoy the Borough Markets - a huge selection of cooked foods from across the globe, sweets & pastries, cold meats and cheese, breads, fresh fruit/vege, condiments, fresh seafood - the works! Plenty to eat on the day and things to purchase and take home. In the hot food department you can find foods such as german sausages with sauerkraut, paella's, italian pastas, pies, hog on the spit, duck rolls, salty beef rolls, unique meat burgers (like zebra, kangaroo, ostrich).... just to name a few. Every avenue has a surprise in stall. Borough Markets is a short walk from so many other tourist attractions - the Shard, Catty sark, Southwark cathedral, Hay's galleria, London and Tower Bridges. You can walk down to the River Thames on the Southbank side.... again just to name a few....||October 3, 2014
nagsNorwich||50||Went for lunch here........the smells were enticing and the choice was international.Worth a look if you are near the Shard, Cutty Sark, or Southwark Cathedral||October 1, 2014
Kati M||50||What an experience to visit this market! Great food stands, lots of varieties, celebraties to see and tasty food to eat. The location was amazing!||October 1, 2014
Alain W||40||Borough markets especially on a Saturday is a busy produce market where you can pick up seafood, poultry, game, fruit and vegs, get a decent coffee, grab a paella pan, iberico jamo, cheeses. At one of butches you will get to see game birds, hare still unplucked with heads attached, even a deer hung by its hind legs if your lucky ( Apologies to vegetarians). Go early if you want to avoid the crowds.||September 30, 2014
SakeSake||50||This is foody heaven!!!!!!!!! I have been 3 times and want to visit again. It never Disappoints. The array of sight, sounds, delicious smells, the trains banging over head the hustle and bustle... It is class. Full of life! The food, drinks And produce on offer is better experienced than words can do justice! I am in heaven when I visit and my favourite thing is seeing all the other food fanatics getting soooo excited when the spot things. Please don't miss it. Hope this is helpful, ps my tip... Go at breakfast and go very hungry.... A good couple of hours will wizz past in a flash! Also beware how much you buy! You will be lugging it all round London if you are not careful... So easy to get arrived away.||September 30, 2014
shellk66||50||Had the Ethiopian food, which tasted as good as it smelled and the staff serving were sweet, friendly and helpful. For dessert we went to Gelateria 3BIS which served the most gorgeous ice cream I have ever had. I recommend the Milk Ice Cream. its the best meal you could ever have for less than a tenner!!! ||September 30, 2014
rialoha||50||If you live for food, seriously this market is a MUST. Maybe it was especially phenomenal because it was the beginning of autumn, but I am sure it has gotta be great no matter the time of year. My only regret is that I didn't visit this place at the beginning of my trip, so I could eat here everyday.||September 30, 2014
chefquak||40||son & i went to london’s most famous market, borough market, on morning of 23.8.2014. took northern line from king’s cross to london bridge.we were planning to try out the several famous street eats here.borough market started in the current location from 1755, though records from 1014 listed it as a market for fish, grain, livestocks, fruits & vegetables.the wholesale market opens weekdays 2am-8am. the retail market opens wednesday to thursday 10am to 5pm, fridays from 10am to 6pm, and saturdays from 8 am to 5 pm.1 of the famous eats is the £5 duck confit sandwich, and that was also the first we tried. it was pretty good. the confit duck rillette was tasty & tender & did not disappoint. the ciabatta bread though was not very exciting, kind of tougher to the bite.the next we tried was the £6.50 belly pork sandwich at roast. a queue built up rather quickly! it came with ok pork belly & a sheet of crispy skin. sad to say, for me the “crackling skin” was about the standard of my failed belly pork attempts & quite unedible. :-( the bread was softer & better than the ciabatta of the duck confit sandwich. we didn’t try the beef sandwich, perhaps that would be better.we had the single chorisa bun at brindisia. though a blogger mentioned it was more worthwhile to have the double chorizo for £4.95 instead of the single £3.95, my son disagreed, he thought it would be too salty with 2 chorizos, and i had to agree with him after trying it.of the 3 my preference would be (1) duck confit sandwich (2) chorizo bun (3) belly pork sandwich.we found the salt beef (corn beef) sandwich shortly. it looked really good. my son thought it looked better than it tasted. in any case we did not have space for it. nor the other food.paella seller was offering free tasting with a small plastic spoon. the taste was ok but this was like a mass cooking & well below my own seafood risotto, so held no attraction for us.they also served other dishes like calamari, cajun chicken etc.one stall was selling fresh cooked seafood, from prawns, jellied eels, whelks, crayfish salad to dorset crab.the homemade mushroom pate was very flavourful. my son bought 1 tub for £4.there were exotic burgers including kangaroo, crocodile, zebra, elk, ostrich.and the olive & cheese sticks at bread ahead was another famous stall at borough market.market was quite crowded close to noon on a saturday.they had whole roast pig too!& there was free wifi at the market.overall, the few famous dishes were pretty ok though nothing really caught my fancy (too much bread/carb for me anyway). it was still better by miles than the very poor poppies fish & chip at camden which we had on 24.8.2014. see my full reviews & photos at http://chefquak.com/2014/09/01/street-eats-borough-market-on-23aug2014/||September 29, 2014
norcalfoodie2014||40||We discovered the Borough Market at lunchtime on our recent visit to London. So yummy! The Roast Pig Wraps are a must! From breakfast to afternoon tea, you will find everything you need.||September 29, 2014
5onic||50||Brilliant, busy and buzzing.Cheap, excellent quality food. A sensory explosion.Visit it, if you are in town. ||September 27, 2014
donboydeluxe||50||I spent a week in London last week the Market was right across the street from my hotel, if your a lover of food this is the place for you, one my one visit I got some breakfast rolls, foccacio bread (So good!) some pastries. there are so many food booths its hard to remember or where each one is, its best just to walk around and load up big time! made the mistake of having the standard overpriced hotel breakfast instead of going to the market a second day. if you are in the area a must visit.||September 27, 2014
Berbera v||50||Lovely market with great variety in food stalls. Fish, meat, vegs, artisan breads, sandwiches. Wanted to try it all!Busy and nice mixed crowd of locals and tourists.||September 27, 2014
Kalyn N||50||There are so many markets in London however this one is a must see. The food stalls are incredible- the African salad we had was incredible and only 5£. All the meat, cheese, and condiment stalls are incredibly fresh and yummy- wish we could have brought it all on the plane with us. The shops around the outside of the market are also worth a visit.||September 27, 2014
Blondie7373||50||Buy a glass of Prosecco and sip as you wander... 2 for £6 to takeaway at Beatles. Too much food to list here.. enjoy!||September 27, 2014
TishLondon||40||We visit the Market quite often and always enjoy it. Lovely produce and if you are looking for a particularly unusual ingredient, you will find it here. Open Thursday, Friday and Saturday and always busy. Lots of stalls to buy a good quality snack if you don't mind eating on the go. London prices but not too bad. Recommend a Christmas visit, great fun. ||September 26, 2014
ima1derer||40||Take a break from the museums, palaces and cathedrals. Come here for a change of scenery and interesting smells. It's a working market where you can find artisanal products as well as your day to day market items of vegetables, fruits and meats. This is also a foodie destination where you can try a variety of meats prepared in a number if ways - you name it - roasted, fried, smoked and grilled. Experience different smells and aromas mixed together from cooked food items and fresh fruits, breads and artisanal cheeses. Mostly take-away food items as there is no sitting inside the market. Noisy and crowded, this is one of those things you need to do at least once when in London.||September 25, 2014
8ashleighs||30||We went to Borough Market to see the colored umbrellas that we found online, but they weren't there. The market was pretty crowded.Also there were many different smells coming from all the vendors, together it didn't smell to appetizing.||September 23, 2014
Garth_Trelawney||40||Loads of great options. Loads of interesting delicacies.But when it is all said and done my favourite thing to buy at Borough Markets is the good old doughnut. Seriously, you will never eat a doughnut from anywhere else ever again. There are a couple of filling options but you can get a vanilla cream in a doughnut that is the lightest dough you will ever bite into. Oh there are some great pulled pork rolls, pies and many other things.Don't go to Borough markets if you don't like crowds and don't expect to find any amazing bargains. But there is plenty of food to eat. You will have to go back more than once.||September 23, 2014
Rosslyn H||50||Once you have visited Borough Market you will return so go first on a Monday or Tuesday which are "non market days" to get your bearings. You will want to walk through the covered market and the surrounding neighborhood. The market is very crowded on market days - try to get there and before noon or after lunch. A short walk from London Bridge rail and tube. The web site is not the best. Public toilets are available. You will be spoked for choice - fresh veg, meats, fish and prepared food.||September 23, 2014
WilliamB826||40||There not many other places in London that shows just how diversified London has become over the last 20-30 years. The Borough Markets adjacent to ''The Shard'' and ''London Bridge'' Underground Station is one of the most cosmopolitan gathering spots in London. There are all types of food stalls which introduce all the flavours of the mixed cultures which show just how blended London has become. Each ethnic group seems to be represented in a colourful mish-mash of colourful food offerings. There are artifacts, pubs and fresh vegetables and fruit all at affordable prices. Be careful to avoid the lunch time rush as all the local office workers get down there for the very affordable and exotic lunches on offer. Be prepared to stand because there is not a lot of seating, unless you wander off in to the adjacent church grounds and sit on the walls. You will enjoy this, even if you don't get involved in what's on offer. The sights, smells and sounds make it a great ''London'' experience.||September 22, 2014
Sarah S||50||I absolutely love Borough Market; the atmosphere is fantastic and there are always so many excellent things to see and try. Already planning another pre-Christmas visit to stock up on goodies and presents!||September 22, 2014
MichaelMacartney||50||What a great place. Loads of stalls selling the most delicious food all of which at affordable prices. Added to this the great stalls selling fresh produce and of course the excellent pubs||September 22, 2014
adizush||50||The market has all kinds of food you can think of! The atmosphere is also very nice and welcoming and everything is so yummy! Just make sure to get there as hungry as possible :)||September 22, 2014
Aria M||50||dislike : lack of sitting spacelike : variety of food. price. the artisan food stalls were amazingly inspiring, although price can be a little bit friendlier. ||September 22, 2014
821adrianw||40||Nice market, enjoy a lot of very nice food, the place also strategic as close to tube station and bus stop of the London bridge||September 21, 2014
RonA_Plymouth||50||Any one who likes good food ( even it might not be too healthy for you) then you need to visit here. The range of foods is extensive and specialist foods to suit most tastes are in abundance, I personally liked the cheeses. We went at lunchtime and would reccomend it, but take no responsibity for any weight gain. Enjoy||September 21, 2014
Debsar||50||What an amazing place. First visit. The atmosphere was amazing. Very busy with lots of great stalls. Took away some Spanish omelette and mixed salad to have for lunch. It was delicious. Will definitely visit again next time in London.||September 20, 2014
Tab-on-tour||50||AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!! Make sure you go there with an empty stomach, because there are SO many things to eat and drink! It is truly an experience! Don't miss it!!||September 20, 2014
Vicksyvixy||50||If you like bustling markets then this is the place for you! I love them and wish I could visit every day but it's probably better for my waistline that I don't! Lots of eateries, fruit and veg stalls, delicious foods from around the world and sweet temptations galore! A great place to hang out with friends, enjoying a drink and bite to eat or alternatively an opportunity to buy presents for loved ones who are real foodies. Whatever your reason, a lovely place to browse. ||September 20, 2014
200charlesw||50||Almost too much to choose from. Could walk around for ever trying different food from all over the world. Only negative is some things are very over priced. ||September 20, 2014
TKSuper368||40||Went there on friday 10am and we enjoyed the walk among the vegetables, food and sellers of all types of stuff ! It is the biggest market in London, and remember to go there with an empty stomach !Best time to visit is 10am in the morning (when they open) because it gets very crowded later part of the day (opens thursday to sunday).PS. Oh.. do not forget to patronise the gelato ice cream shop at the side street which is very popular. Write to me if you want to know the name.||September 20, 2014
mark21wine||50||This place has become to me a haven for obviously great food and also food friends. ALWAYS go here early Saturday mornings (8am ish YES!!!!! ) to do a full food shopping for the week. This is not as expensive as you think as long as you come regularly and then the stall holders treat you well and you understand how to shop at Borough (avoid prepared foods as they can work expensive). Many highlights amongst the array of stalls: Spice mountain , spices not only one of one of the best in London (this is a premium spice space In the Capital) with the added zing of the owner's knowledge and banter iAds to your experience. A big mention for Paul at Sussex Fisher who goes at extremely early in the week (Middle of the night for us city plodders) and then brings it to us fresh reasonably well priced (similar to supermarket equivalents) with a smile and joke. Many others of these inspired people need mentioning, just get of your BUTTS and support UK Industry at is very best (pretty please).||September 19, 2014
483angelaa||50||Great market that doesn't really get going till 11.30 am. Managed to find a pasta stall selling pasta to eat there and then or take home It was stunning. Lots of stalls have a day or two off in the week so be if careful if your travelling a long way which day you go.||September 19, 2014
tam682||50||We enjoy Borough Market when we are in London. Lots of eclectic places to buy food on the go. Biggest problem is deciding what to eat. Don't go at the weekend unless you are happy to be in the middle of a crowd.Will be back.||September 19, 2014
MichH43||40||We were in the market quite early but still loads of tourists, many just taking photos...close ups of food, have people not seen good produce before. Its good quality food but aimed more at the tourists, high prices.||September 18, 2014
Derek B||50||If you are ever in the area of Borough Market, pop in you will not be disappointed. There is a huge selection of food on offer, hot or cold, either to eat there or take away. You could go there every day for a month and not eat the same thing twice, and prices are very reasonable. Within easy walking distance of the Shard you could combine the two. If I had to find a minus it would be the toilets, try and find some elsewhere.||September 18, 2014
Hazel C||40||This was a fantastic experience but really only if your a food lover ! as in, your open minded and willing to try anything and your interested in different food cultures and your not fussy and you don't just stick to your plain burger and chips all the time... its even more fun and useful if your a fan of cooking.. as you can get a wide range of fresh ingredients ... when we wee there we bought a jar of honey - straight from the bees ! and got cookies and meringues the size of our head !||September 18, 2014
LassiComeHome||50||Love this place -a foodie's paradise. You can spend hours tasting food from England, Scotland etc - plus countries from all over the world. A short walk fro the Tate gallery I suggest an early morning here - have some good food - then walk to the Tate Gallery and walk off all the food you have just eaten. Excellent place! See photos.||September 16, 2014
r1150gs01||50||Don't miss going to Borough Market while in London. It is a great place to walk around and enjoy the sights and smells. The food is great. You can also walk to the riverside from there where you find entertainers and more wonderful sights.||September 16, 2014
Andrée H||40||Great place to get a taste of almost every kind of food. It's usually very crowded but definitely worth a visit.||September 16, 2014
YUL_65||50||Great food! Try scottish eggs or meat pies. Great place to grab a bite at lunch. Great prices but very crowdy. Closed on Sunday however.||September 14, 2014
Sylvia D||50||The market is a visual delight, so much to see and experience. It is hard not to buy something to eat but the choices are endless. It is fun to see all the different types of food both for sale and to eat on the spot. It is an easy walk to the Millenium Bridge and St Paul's Cathedral so it is good full day of sightseeing.||September 14, 2014
Ice_D_8||50||Borough Market is a dedicated market for food. All sorts of produce are sold here - from truffles, to venison, to bakery treats, to handmade turkish delight. There are food stalls spanning cuisines from many countries. It is a food lover''s dream!||September 14, 2014
StewNYC||50||Hunt around a little and you find a little shack that makes and sells the best full English breakfast in London. Not some rip-off hotel or pub 20 quid rubbish, but a bacon, sausage, eggs, beans, mushrooms, tomatoes & (best of all) BUBBLE AND SQUEAK feast for a tenner.Then you can roll yourself around and buy some fantastic food & produce for dinner!Sorted!||September 13, 2014
AnaCrisOhira||40||Wow, it's very difficult to choose where to eat here.There's a lot of options from worldwide.And after eat, don't forget to try a special dessert... are amazing!!!!||September 13, 2014
Bruce L||50||We headed down to the National Gallery this morning from our vacation rental in Soho, and with it being such a lovely day, we continued on to see Millenium Bridge and when in the area dropped in at the Borough Market under London Bridge for a break and to pick up some local produce and "goodies". There are quite a number of stalls offering everything from fresh veggies, baking, spirits and items suitable for gifts (jams, mustards, etc.) We stopped in at a little spot called "Engliish Wine & Spirits" to sample some lovely English wines suggested by the helpful staff and enjoy a glass while watching the busy shoppers. Lots to see, smell and taste in the Borough Market. Take it slow, there's lots to see here and the numerous food stalls will cater to every palate.||September 12, 2014
458alanp||40||Well worth a visit if your nearby with plenty to choose from both food on the go and fresh food etc. Plenty of choice then but not a place to pick up a bargain. ||September 12, 2014
Carol D||40||Attending the various markets was one of my favorite experiences in London. This one had to be the best for foodies. The smell of all the different foods: Indian, Ethiopian, West Indies, and British were great. The different vendors not selling "lunch" had a variety of teas, cheeses, ciders, baked good among some of the items we tasted. This was actually a more expensive place to eat than other market, but I am talking about 6-7 pounds vs 3 that I was spending else where. Food was good and the prices were still lower than the restaurants. Worth wandering around and dining at.||September 11, 2014
Cassie2808||50||Not far from a lot of other attractions and just up from the Globe is Borough Market. Obviously Londoners and those who work near by know of it but for the tourist it is perhaps not obvious and yet it is a fascinating place to visit not least because there are all kind of yummy morsels to taste as you go round. If you are visiting London and 'doing' the Southbank plus Globe area pop up to the market for a look - you will enjoy what it has to offer.||September 11, 2014
Chademan||50||Amazing food at borough markets. We went there everyday for a snack after catching train in. So much different types of food stalls. Get there now!||September 11, 2014
Gill A||50||Wow! This a food lover's paradise. So much choice and variety with street food from all over the world. I just wish we had something like this in my home town||September 10, 2014
155jacquic||50||If you like food, flowers and all things fresh this is the perfect place to visit. The smells that hit you when you wander round are amazing, I made the trip to get some dried chilli that I struggle to get nearer home and ended up walking round the entire market for about hours just drinking in the sights and sounds of the bustling market. .........Make sure you get to see it||September 9, 2014
Andrew L||50||Wow, really enjoyed it here. Just around the corner from The Shard and right next to Southwark Cathedral, there are a lot of good (and a couple of not so good) food stalls on offer. Some great and very friendly stallholders add to the experience. Ate some very good vegetarian Indian, so so Thai, lovely Turkish Delight and some good old sausage and egg baps. Add a cracking coffee from The Monmouth Coffee shop just outside the market and it's a great way of spending some time. TIP. Leave London Bridge Underground station via the Borough High Street exit and the market is straight across the road. Try and avoid lunch time as it gets very busy with local workers from around 12.30pm. Will definitely return again. ||September 9, 2014
kevshent||50||Everything here is about food from artisan bakers, good old fashioned butchery to all the street food you could imagine! Try from any choice of foods for lunch, you won't be disappointed!||September 8, 2014
June B||50||Loved every aspect - the stalls all looked amazing. If you like food on the go so much to choose from - lovely fresh produce - cheese, breads, cakes, meat, oils and much much more. ||September 8, 2014
Vicki L||50||This market was amazing! Nice and chilled for a London market, with produce ranging from European sausage to vegan burgers with many fruit and veg stalls. Absolute recommend||September 8, 2014
louisenottingham9||50||Great fun walking around the market on a Saturday. Very busy. Really big market - lots of people - lots of tasting - we had great fun. Too much choice for lunch!||September 8, 2014
Cinder33||50||This is a must visit for anyone coming to London. It saddens me to see people paying over the odds to eat breakfast in their hotels when this gem is just around the corner. There really is something for everyone I'm a vegan and my other half a dedicated meat eater and we always find something for both of us. I particularly loved the corn on the cob stall- nothing says summer like the smell of corn on a bbq and then getting it roasting hot and dripping in butter!! There's so many things on offer to taste on your way round you can easily end up full before stopping for something to eat - there are also lots of little speciality stalls selling gluten free etc.I really can't recommend it enough||September 7, 2014
Van2uk||50||One of the best market and attraction you can visit in london.Loads of different organic fruits and vegetables you can buy. Different shapes and colours. Amazing food from different parts of the world imported and selling in this market. Cheese, ham, bread, olives, cakes, sweets , name it everything is there. Food from Argentina, Germany, Poland, Spain , etc. all are there.Prices - some expensive, some average.There's also restaurants and pubs around the area.There's also a wine and whisky shop there which our favourite part. Tips: make sure you have cash with you and you happy to try different foods from everywhere! Have fun !!!!!||September 7, 2014
kkbb33||50||A friend suggested I visit Borough Market when I was in London, and I am SO glad I took her up on it! This place is massive. There are a ton of food stalls on one side of the street (meals, cheese, desserts, drinks, you name it) and the other side has vendors that sell things like produce, meats, alcohol, etc. that you can take home and use. We stopped at a pie place and SoulFood for lunch (the two stalls are right next to each other) and it may have been the best lunch I had during my entire two weeks in England. I got a Chicken of Aragon pie and my friend got a chicken wrap from SoulFood, which we then split. There was a stand selling some fresh mint ice tea, which was the perfect accompaniment to our meal. We even found a delicious dessert stall. I would highly recommend stopping by at least once--or twice--to anyone who is staying in London. It's an easy find right off the London Bridge tube stop, and is totally worth the trip.||September 7, 2014
IainMacpherson||50||If you enjoy food at any level this this is probably the best of all destinations in a London tour. A huge variety of fresh produce, spices, jams, chutneys, preserves, cured meats, seafood, cakes, sweets, chocolates...the list goes on. We savoured ready to eat food at a number of different stalls and it was all fantastic. The chorizo rolls, confit duck with a glass of sangria, chocolate brownies and fudge went down very well. It's not cheap but it's great value for money. Take you time and see everything because there is a lot to see and some places are tucked away around corners. There are conflicting reports on when it is open so hopefully this will help - a stall owner told me that the fully market is open Thursday to Saturday. It's CLOSED on Sundays and open from around 10am - 3pm Monday to Wednesdays but mostly for the lunch trade, with ready to eat stalls only open. I have been to London many times but this was the first trip to Borough market. The next time I am in London it may well be the first place I visit. Go. ||September 7, 2014
TMRH||50||One of our favourite things to do on a Saturday morning is to go buy some fresh produce. You can get almost anything at the markets and if you like cheese or cold meats there is a huge range of choices. Great atmosphere and even if you just want a lot of choices for lunch then plenty of snack food choices also.If you like milk shakes then try Bath Soft Cheese as they make one of the best milk shakes in London. Chocolate our favourite.||September 6, 2014
Beechee68||50||The very busy borough markets on a Saturday is an amazing place of mixed cultures, foods and food producers. It provides a great atmosphere and array of food smells that lure you in from the Thames. Catch the ferry down and walk a short distance off the docks. ||September 6, 2014
michelleg252||50||Lots of delicious food to see & buy. It's very busy at weekends , never been during the week so not,sure what it's like then . It can be expensive but well worth a visit.||September 5, 2014
SBG356||50||Great atmosphere! The sights sounds and smells are fab! Great food to buy and eat. Loads of choices. Crowded with both locals and tourists. Love it!||September 5, 2014
Stephen D||50||Higgledy piggledy, jumbled up market containing every food experience you will need! Go there, you must. Really!!||September 4, 2014
Bearsm53||40||It's nice to see that a market like this can survive and even thrive in today's society. There are lots of stalls here selling cheese, fruit, meat, fish, spices and hot meals to take away or eat on site. The market is situated right next to London Bridge Underground so you will have no trouble to find it. It's closed Sundays, but other days it will be open between 10 am and 5 pm. Saturdays it opens already at 8 am and Fridays it closes at 6 pm.Enjoy your visit!||September 3, 2014
JCTCL||50||My wife and I arrived early with a plan to "just look around" Ha, the people were so inviting and friendly we stayed way too long( our kids were back at the flat waiting for us). We sampled and bought, and bought and bought. If you go there hungry, you will not be when you are done. Great cheese, meat, veggies, sweets, etc. If you enjoy food, this is a must visit!||September 3, 2014
Hivedoc||50||I have been to London many times but had never before been to Borough Market. I was traveling with my 13 year old son thus went to many of the typical tourist sites, Big Ben, London Bridge, etc. On our first day in London we went to the Market for lunch (a Thursday). The market was packed and alive. Hundreds of people waiting in lines for lovely local food. There were artisan pie makers, curry stands, sandwiches carved from whole roasted pigs, baked goods, beautiful cheeses and produce. Venders were friendly and interactive. We returned to the market Friday and Saturday, once for breakfast and once for lunch. I can't imagine there is a more impressive exhibition of British food stuffs in London.||September 3, 2014
953RobertM953||50||I will keep this short because most of my reviews are negative -This market very close to London Bridge is a jewel in London Crown,Don't make the mistake and miss this venue - a food blast ! Go hungry ||September 2, 2014
Sabrina R||50||If you can visit the Borough Market in London don’t go hungry! I guess I should say buy and eat a sandwich or meal from one of the vendors first and then stroll around and shop for some of the other special foods you can buy. I had to keep remembering that I needed to carry what I was buying with me on the Tube. I was staying with friends and this was a great alternative to eating out. There are several butchers with locally grown meat. We bought one each of several types of sausages and getting to taste them all was a real treat. I was in London in January so there were wild game varieties available. There was a stall selling olives in staggering variety. We also bought several types of local cheese and bread. We enjoyed the variety and quality of our choices so much we went back a second time. This time we shopped for vegetables. I found the vendors to be very helpful, though I was there when it wasn’t too crowded. There was a basket about two feet across that was filled with different types of mushrooms. We told the vendor how much I wanted and that we wanted a sampling of several types and we worked out a nice arrangement. They were delicious! I am glad we went twice as there were different things for sale in one area of the market. This time we also bought some very good chocolates and decadent slices of cake. We stopped at Utobeer both times too. We sampled a dozen different beers between the two trips. The market is located on Southwark Street and Borough High Street. It’s easy to get to and it’s is in close walking distance to several other great places to visit.||September 2, 2014
NickC1||50||What a mecca this place is! An absolute cacophony of smells and tastes in a jumbling flea market concept. Be warned though, it's RAMMED, especially on a weekend, which means it's snails pace working but that's okay because it means you have even more time to sample all the food. In fact it's probably possible to fill your belly just in free samples alone, so long as you don't mind dining on every single cuisine in the world. It's mostly undercover and the stall-holders are wonderfully friendly and clearly embrace the tourism factor. Be warned though, only one set of public toilets just outside the market stall, so if you think you might get caught short then stop first.||September 1, 2014
KateLondon_9||50||Borough market is incredible. I love it. The food stalls are incredible - great fish, meat, cheese, bread etc. Most stalls offer little tastes of everything. I've been coming here for years. The restaurants on the outskirts of the market are also great. And try a chorizo sandwich from brindisa for lunch. The only down sides - it's expensive and it's busy. Come early in the morning if you want to shop for fine quality food and avoid the tourists. ||September 1, 2014
Minulin||40||It's a market very courious, side of the Great Southwork Cathedral, and under the trains. Very amazing and very interesting food. Beautiful place.||September 1, 2014
Twinkle68||50||Where to start? An amazing array of fresh produce beautifully arranged. Meat, cheese, spices, fruit and vegetables, fresh bread, charcuterie, and as for the "street" food... Absolutely dazzling! ||September 1, 2014
nojokes||50||bustling market in the middle ofLondon, food form all over the world it seems and a great place to wander, eat, drop in the Wheatsheaf for a drink and thenn mooch some more - loved it.||September 1, 2014
McAuley2007||50||Discovered Borough Market when we hopped off the London Bus Tour at London Bridge. We followed our noses, literally! The smell of food was amazing. Loads of different stalls offering all varieties of food. Have to say the stall that got the biggest smile from me was the one selling Toasted Cheese Sandwiches. I can sense your confusion, "What's so amazing about a cheese toastie?" I hear you ask. My simple answer is, imagine rows upon rows of cheese sandwiches ready to be toasted with thick, white homemade bread and ..... about 3-4 inches of grated cheese!!! Just imagine the gooey goodness! I'm sure you're smiling now? There were people standing around, some were sitting on Church steps, others were scattered across a nearby grassy area, all eating out of their hands. Just a sheer delight to experience and enjoy.||September 1, 2014
Isabel B||40||Stumbled across this great market in the heart of London. It sells many different kinds of prepared food in different stalls, like good quality german hot dogs, hot potatoes with raclette cheese, salads, focaccias, desserts etc...it's semi under cover but couldn't get a coffee there! It's a touristy attraction and from there you can do the queens walk to the tower bridge, it's a nice walk!||August 31, 2014
mjb1001||50||We came here for lunch in the middle of a trip to London - especially because there just aren't markets like this where we live. We spent an extremely pleasant hour grazing on things you just can't get in Japan. Black pudding scotch eggs followed by a slice of game pie, washed down with a glass of cider and then some apple juice.Surely the best place to stock up for eating on the hoof, unless you want to brave the food halls at Harrods or somewhere. Yum.||August 31, 2014
wavingatclouds||50||Go if you get the chance if you like markets, it feels more like a traditional European market. Lots of hustle and bustle, great choice of bread on offer.We had a fabulous breakfast sandwich, egg, bacon, pork burger, hollandaise sauce (£5.00) there were loads of other options on offer too.We bought some lovely date and walnut bread and fruit.Nice coffee bar over the road opposite The Globe pub called Rabat with fresh ground coffee and a roof terrace if you want a meal||August 31, 2014
Val9401||50||Visited for the first time. Undercover, and a great range of stalls. Lovely fruit & veg, meats, cheeses, breads etc. Hot and cold foods, chocolates & cakes, and there is a picnic area, so you can sit down and enjoy your purchases. Loved it!||August 31, 2014
2011npr||40||One of Londons hidden gems but well worth finding.Under the shadow of the shard you cannott fail to be tempted with real fresh food at reasonable prices apart from the chocolate.Many tasty morsels being served up a marvelous place for lunch.||August 30, 2014
fionamlj||50||Great atmosphere with all the hustle and bustle of a busy market. Amazing variety of smells coming from all of the stalls. A huge selection to choose from. not cheap but very good quality. well worth a visit. Lovely part of London rich in heritage.||August 30, 2014
TomGagnon||50||So you are in London and want to experience what the city has to offer for food. The Borough Market has been in operation since 1756. It is an outdoor market on the other side of the Thames and a short walk from London Bridge. This outdoor market has avery kind of food and drink available. Stroll through the market and sample food from the vendors. Great meals, desserts, wine, cheese, seafood, and breads await you. The market is open Wednesday to Saturday. Have lunch here at least once. I only wish I was able to make it one more time during my stay in London.||August 30, 2014
Denis M||50||We've been going to this Market on a weekly basis for quite some time but for some reason, I haven't reviewed it yet. Perhaps it's because it's become a familiar part of our life. We get all our eggs here; they come from free-range Lakeland hens and the yokes are almost always beautifully orange. When they're a bit paler they still taste so much better than even the best supermarket eggs, and they're cheaper too. The Ginger Pig is there, of course, where we regularly buy traditional pork pies, which rival the other best pork pies in England, from J Stanforth's in Skipton, West Yorkshire. And there's Fitz who supply such delicacies as truffle honey and truffle mustard plus unusual jams such as rose petal. They also sell reasonably priced tinned French cassoulets with amazing duck confit,Toulouse sausage, haricot beans and sauce. Plus you can get all kinds of fresh seasonal fruit at prices comparable to supermarket prices, if not lower. If you've got the time you can spend the whole day there and enjoy every minute.||August 28, 2014
suzy814||50||Great food, awesome location!!! You have the beautiful cathedral next to it, so there is a nice view. Definitely worth it.||August 27, 2014
Shelley G||50||What a great market!Fantastic stalls selling a diverse range of foods and drinks!Loads to sample, stalls selling a huge variety of hot food, ready to eat on the go.The tastes and smells will stay with us... Fabulous!||August 27, 2014
Foodie M||50||Smack in the middle if the city centre, this market was fabulous! Amazing foods offered in stall after stall, fresh produce from the farms (full market on Wednesday), flowers, seafood and even a demo kitchen.The demo kitchen was giving a talk on how to start a sourdough culture and make sourdough bread. I love making bread so made my way to the stall during one of the 11-2pm time slots and not only did he tell us about the culture, we made one with him to take home for ourselves AND he gave us a little tub of rye flour to keep going - all for FREE.So delightful, I tried everything and even though I was stuffed to the gills, I wanted to try the next stall and the next ... !The Fish! And chips stall was fresh fish with the fattest gorgeous chips, the oysters were fresh salty and delicious, the Ethiopian chicken was beautifully spiced, the Kashoori... I could go on, it was all there and all delicious.We finished off our visit with a hot chocolate from Hotel Chocolat - 78% pure chocolate melted down and mixed with a tiny bit of steamed milk. Sigh, so good.||August 27, 2014
Damian T||50||This is a great place to kill an hour or two, trying new things before you eventually decide what you want for lunch - either to take home and make yourself, or from one of the many stalls selling cakes and coffee.||August 25, 2014
101wille||50||We hadn't been to Bororugh Market for some time - but it was well worth returning, the market has grown considerably and is now very akin to Barcelona"s central market . It's a place wander, to smell, to enjoy the ambience. The market and surrounding streets buzz with life, the smells from the cheeses the hams and veg assault your senses, there is no lack of places to eat or drink from the street stall to michelin style food. It's not a place to rush, but a place to savour - go find the truffled brie - it's outstanding - enjoy your visit - you will !||August 25, 2014
kellie1803||50||love everything Bout borough market. thee are foods from all over the world and you get to taste almost everything. cheeses, meats, oils, fish, oysters and even champagne!!!! kids loved it!! highly recommend.||August 25, 2014
pumcia||50||Long forgotten by me place in London. Cant remember when was the last time i went there to eat.This saturday we decided to go there for our weekly fruit and veggie shopping.We had great time sipping yummy smoothies and eating delicious food.Highly recommending to everyone.||August 24, 2014
l0veh0lidays||50||Found this by chance when we got off the open top bus. Fabulous smells from this market from all different types of food well worth a visit .||August 24, 2014
Mateen N||40||After 6 years in London, finally came here on a Saturday morning, and as the title suggests, i wasn't disappointed. A huge selection of fruit, veg, meat, fish and freshly cooked food and much more. It was rather busy, but that was expected, but i almost spent two hours in there wondering through all the different stalls, tasting everything and buying stuff that i needed...did get a little carried away with the cheese and breads though. Would highly recommend it.||August 24, 2014
raynaO_12||50||Another on my 'regular' list for Saturday mornings when I stay in town. I try and go early to avoid the worst of the crowds and do no breakfast before getting there. Borough has an amazing mix of food stalls from around the world and everything from basic ingredients to completed dishes - wandering round talking to passionate producers sampling their products is easily a blissful couple of hours. I never tire of visiting as it tends to be different every time and a real slice of London life. A must not miss if you are visiting!!||August 24, 2014
roselop||50||I absolutely enjoyed my visit to Borough Market! I was a bit overwhelmed though when faced with so many food stalls selling fresh produce, cheeses, sausages, salami etc. I particularly loved the Raclette sandwich which was so heavenly & delicious. The paella was fantastic as well! The truffle honey was a wonderful discovery, we bought several jars to bring home. I wish we could have sampled all the goodies but it was just impossible, you can only eat so much. Best to go on a Thursday or Friday to avoid the crowd. There are also many interesting pubs & restaurants nearby worth visiting. Will definitely make it a point to come back again!||August 24, 2014
Clara121||50||This place is amazing! The people, the vendors and most importantly all of the food on sale is to die for! I went on a Saturday morning which hasn't been my brightest idea because it was so busy but I managed to spend enough time there to sample delights such as fresh home made pasta and a chacerteruie cone which I thought was ingenious. Ever since my trip there its all I've talked about with my friends. Next time I will go when it's mid day so I can really mooch around. ||August 24, 2014
PaoloP66||50||I dropped by the Borough Market because I reached the wrong bridge of London: I wanted to reach Tower Bridge, I landed in London Bridge.This proved to be a very lucky coincidence: to my greatest surprise, just our of London Bridge tube I spotted this market.I am an Italian Slow Food member, so you can imagine my surprise seeing tens of stalls selling cheeses from France, England, Italy, or salame, oysters, organic ciders, fruit and vegetables from the farmers...A paradise for your eyes, your nose and your tongue.My heart was lighter after the visit: the globalization of taste has not yet won until places like this exist...||August 23, 2014
dub53||50||If your into food this us a must when visiting London Bread stalls galore accompanied by loads of cheese huge stalls for cider and champagne queuing for bratwurst sausage rollsWhat more do you want?||August 23, 2014
Pambolina||50||Great place to visit but should have come with an empty stomach to be able to enjoy all if the dry tempting displays Wide range of food and drinks and very enjoyable to just wander around. We will be back to sample more||August 22, 2014
Emily H||50||I love this place!! For anyone who loves food, this is the place to go! Such an amazing array of foods from around the world - the stalls that are a bit more like shops have such a wide selection of products to buy as well as market stalls with fantastic fresh produce. Plenty of places offer tasters of products too and the staff are always knowledgeable and helpful. The street food stalls smell amazing - again a wide variety of foods to suit most palates! If I lived closer, I would visit very frequently but I love to go when in London and will definitely be back!||August 22, 2014
Taxidevil||50||For me a trip to London is not complete without a visit to Borough market.This time we bought delicious chocolate brownies. You can find food from all over the world here and I wish that we had an apartment in London so that I could shop for fruit and veg here.It is really busy and full of hustle and bustle so we were pleased to find a lovely area where we could sit and enjoy our food and also public toilets nearby.||August 21, 2014
qscofr1||40||It is a nice market but it was better before when thing was less organised because it looks more natural.There is one shop that sale cheeses that are very very nice and product are wonderfull||August 21, 2014
snowy71||50||I had my first visit and I was hooked.. You can browse the markets and taste and nibble along the way.. Best visited with locals so that you can buy some goods and go back and cook it up.. Loved that we could buy some Pimms on ice with fruit and drink while going through the markets... Make sure you get off the tube a stop or two early so you can walk there to burn off some calories before the eating frenzy begins...||August 21, 2014
si-shep||50||You could easily leave here very overweight and very poor, so many amazing looking food stalls, Pieminster is worth a try!||August 20, 2014
Travelling_Circus_11||30||We had a fun stroll around the Borough Market on Bastille Day. We drank prosecco as we wandered around and stopped to slurp some lovely, fresh oysters. However, it was a Sunday so many of the stalls were closed. I think it would be even more fun to visit during a regular market day.||August 20, 2014
DKYHZ_Traveller||50||This is a great market to visit, has a lot of different vendors and samples to try. Only problem is I wanted to buy to much of the good food for it to fit the suitcase. It is located in a nice neighborhood also.||August 20, 2014
Bricodust||50||Visited on a Saturday morning, absolutely packed with all sorts of nationalities.The food was fantastic, so much to choose from, English , Indian, Chinese and even Ethiopian.Lots of 'buns' packed with bacon, sausage, wild boar, etc etc.Great selection of meats, cheeses, fruit and veggies and also lots of lovely breads and confectionery.A must place to visit.||August 19, 2014
BrendaP775||50||Southside London has a completely different feel from the locations north of the Thames. There is a real local neighborhood feel here, and Borough Market is like the neighborhood market. Most of it is under cover so this can be a good place to explore when the typical London rains are falling. There are fruits, vegetables, meats, gifts, shops, fast food from carts, just about anything you might expect to find at a market. Southwark Cathedral is next door as is London Bridge, and the London Bridge tube stop is across the street. There are dozens of great restaurants, pubs and shops in the area as well, so you can spend many happy hours exploring around here.||August 19, 2014
funkymusic||50||This place is beyond amazing. Thursday-Saturday is super crazy with all of the stalls open. There is a variety of produce, fish, meats, cheese,sweets from around England on offer. There are many open restaurants serving incredible food at cheap prices and excellent organic options as well. If you are visiting London you MUST visit Borough Market. It is one of the top attractions in London and located in a re-invigorated section of the city. Take the London Underground to London Bridge Station. It is just a 5 minute walk after you exit.||August 19, 2014
capitalcookingshow||40||What to do: A visit to Borough Market is a welcome treat in the city of London. Your findings fresh produce, charcuterie, artisan cheeses, and wonderful take-away food. You can get lost for hours and the beautiful market.||August 19, 2014
spicykit||50||extremely long line up at some food stalls even on weekdays , guess a lot of the Shard employees come to this market during lunch time. Very interesting market with wide variety of foods, need multiple visits to explore all, will definitely come again. Extremely easy to get here, right next to London Bridge tube station exit.||August 18, 2014
fpg||40||As others have said this is a great food market - with cheese meats etc. The thing that made it different for us was the very friendly stall holders - we were offered a taste of everything.There are local pubs nearby with a range of eateries.||August 18, 2014
934Bettina||50||......food for the soul. You just want a piece of everything. Wednesday's the best with full market and fresh stuff everywhere. Having lunch there is the best treat all week||August 18, 2014
khaloof_86||50||This place is full of food. You can sample all kind of food there. Veriety of food can be fined there. Noodles, fast food, fresh juices and fresh fruits all under one roof. Prices are so cheap compare to restaurants.||August 17, 2014
Hackford||30||A well known market so we decided to make a visit, on a Saturday, which was very crowded!Stalls selling allsorts of produce from meat, fish, vegetables, breads and cakes, preserves, etc..and the most incredible selection of Turkish Delights which we indulged in! There are so many stalls producing ready made food to snack on. It was a little too crowded to fully see and appreciate the extent of the market`s environment and eclectic mix so it requires a further visit on a less hectic day say rather than a Saturday!!||August 17, 2014
Stefania_RW||50||Every time I go to London I made a point to stop here to stock up with fresh food and vegetables that I can not find anywhere else. Although it has lost some of the 'real market atmosphere' it had years ago, becoming somehow a posh market, the quality and choices are still great. ||August 17, 2014
Rhona139||50||We have been to London loads of times and never yet found this place - we had a blast talking to the traders - having a wee drink of wine and testing the food on offer. We were travelling so couldn't buy that much but what we did is delicious and fresh. A great find ||August 17, 2014
Chelnov||50||this market is amazing,it has everything a food lover would dream of,visited with my family and we had the following:1- Oysters2- Salted beef with mustard and pickle sandwiches3- olive and cheese loaf4- fruit salad5- organic fruit juice6- Chocolate cake7- Cookienot to mention all the samplings we had :)a great place, Must be visited.||August 16, 2014
MissAllison3||50||We didn't have much time but I am glad we made a stop to peruse through all of the stands. There were so many options and it all looked delicious! I hope to make more time to visit next time we are in London.||August 16, 2014
Ali H||50||A real 'London' experience. So much to see & make sure you don't eat before you go there as there's so much to eat LITERALLY EVERYWHERE!! Huge variety, a little expensive but so worth a visit. Please go.||August 16, 2014
TJW_Woking||50||Love this place - it just gets better. Can't beat the atmosphere, the variety and quality of food, and the opportunity to try so many new things!! Love the generosity of the stall holders - giving samples of their wares..... I'm not the most adventurous foodie, so this is the perfect way to try before I buy. Best to visit early - it's getting really crowded from lunchtime onwards at the Weekends these days. Next visit is in about 4 weeks - can't wait!!||August 15, 2014
HayleyV854||50||I spent time on a walking tour with a friend on the South side of the Thames and this would have been my highlight. Lots going on with amazing and crazy food. Loved all the pockets of excitement within the market and loved seeing 'Bridget Jones' flat! Will definitely make a return to indulge and discover more.||August 15, 2014
Eduardo_travel||40||The market has great stalls for food supplies - spices, cheese and similar. The food however is a bit disappointing ||August 14, 2014
John S||50||A visit to Borough Market is a must and it is my favourite thing to do when coming into London. If you are a foodie then this has to be done!! There is so much fresh cooked food, produce and drink to look at, try and buy. It can get very busy and difficult to move around but the food I have experienced there has been just fantastic. It caters a wide variety of cuisine and vegetarians. Savoury foods along with sweets and drinks. Nice coffee shops and bars in the immediate vicinity too. The biggest problem is getting to try all that you want to!||August 14, 2014
Rebecca R||50||Wow! Amazing place! Very busy but the atmosphere is great. I had a pie called "moo pie", you can guess, it was beef. I can honestly say it was the best pie I have ever tasted. They have hundreds of stands from different countries. So much to see and smell! So much interesting things. I also had a new york cheese cake from this cute stand selling different flavours of cheese cakes. It was delicious. If you are on holiday in London or even just visiting family/friends, you can not miss this place! It is a must see! ||August 13, 2014
Balcombes||50||Busy with lots of good reasonably priced food and good bars limited seating but good atmosphere lovely bistro there as well and close to london bridge||August 12, 2014
Shuting Y||40||there's just so many things over there! Ethiopian, German, English and Asian food (at pretty okay prices), French pastries, meats, bread, organic honey, FRESH oysters, great wines, mushrooms, herbs, fresh seafood..... weekends are really busy tho. Its near the Tate modern, London bridge, St Paul and so on. There's also a little church at the back where you can sit and eat. I absolutely loved it <3||August 12, 2014
SFWOxford||50||Vibrant, colourful, busy and fun. Great place for a wander and maybe a purchase of something great to eat! Lots of places to get breakfast or lunch. easy to get to - around the corner from London Bridge station - and don't forget to take a quick look at Bridget Jones's flat above the Globe pub!||August 12, 2014
Erik S||50||Amazing venue - pricey, but quality beyond reproach! Great banter, loads of samples before you buy, well worth a visit. Recent refub of location very good (more cover and better layout). A few more toilets and seating areas would be good but that's a minor gripe.||August 12, 2014
a M||40||Lots to see, lots of leather goods ...if thats what takes your fancy...good little "foody" stalls...part of a day...do it with other visits.||August 11, 2014
amethystloucks||50||It's a great place to shop, eat, and hang out. Loved the different shops here. It's a good place to take time at. No need to rush it.||August 11, 2014
Lucy O||50||Great atmosphere and wonderful food to try and love, also located near the shard so some great photo opourtunities, don't miss out on this little treasure!||August 11, 2014
paolam254||50||Great place to try some food do some shopping, only cash but there are a few atms around the block, we loved it since we were trying few gyozas and some currys then jumped to some hot coffee with truffles and maccarons, is a great place to start the day then walk around the bridge and go to the big ben, great location!!||August 10, 2014
Momin N||50||A really wonderful place to visit in London . Situated not far from London bridge station. Walk to the destination and enjoy the various foods. Saturdays are the best.||August 10, 2014
ianjamestravers1||50||The market is a foodie paradise cannot describe the food on sale it was just fantastic, the smells were mouth watering just amazing||August 10, 2014
Alison A||40||We had a great little lunch from one of the cart vendors recently. It was a lot of fun to stroll through the market, but unfortunately, it was mostly closed the day we were there, so be sure to check the schedule of the market to avoid that. I'm sure it's a much different experience when the whole market is open and vibrant. When we were there we didn't notice any tables or places to eat, which was disappointing and a bit challenging for lunchtime. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the cultural selection of the street food, as well as our meals. ||August 9, 2014
Catherine R||50||A riot to the senses. This is the place to go for all foodies. Wish this was on my doorstep. Have you tried the mushroom pate? It's amazing stirred through pasta etc.etc. and the German ketchup is a must. We also enjoyed the most amazing street food. Can't wait to get back. P.s don't forget to purchase a borough market hessian bag to use for your purchases.||August 9, 2014
Lily7570||40||Been here many many times and love a mooch through the stalls and a sample of the food. Love Richard Bramble stall with its plates and pictures. Always spend too much money!||August 9, 2014
jonesae||30||Stayed very close by with husband and young kids. Walked through quite a few times day and night time. Brilliant atmosphere so much going on. Bought the most beautiful lemon polenta cake and choc brownie. Enjoyed coffee and hot chocolate soaking up the atmosphere. Will be back just me and hubby as it is difficult with small kids as it gets very busy at times. ||August 8, 2014
Gummybear2014||50||A great choice of market stalls - lots of fruit, veg, meat, fish, cheese, bread and much more as well as lots of food from different cultures. Friendly, knowledgable stall holders. A real gem - something for everyone to enjoy! ||August 8, 2014
derbycitylady||50||Borough Market is a great place to stop for an inexpensive lunch. The problem will be making up your mind what to buy from the many multicultural vendors. The sights, sounds, smells and crowds are over the top. Take your lunch over and sit and listen to the street musician or relax on the lawn of Southwark Cathedral right next to the market. Don't miss Borough Market for the best take food in town.||August 8, 2014
ElizabethK30||50||The stalls, the friendly and knowledgeable stall holders, the superior and diverse product offerings provide an amazing high quality experience for foodies wanting to experience of the diverse English food and culture culture. ||August 7, 2014
melhebs||50||This market is fascinating. Amazing displays and variety of food, from huge varieties of mushrooms to zebra, camel and ostrich meat. Terrific coffee spots, and lovely takeout food.||August 7, 2014
Wapothewhippet||40||I went wandering alone with my camera in this sympathetic market and on an empty stomach... Oups! There is of everything for everybody. The merchants let you sample bites of their products to make you want even more. It is impossible not to buy anything. In the afternoon there is a lot of people having a lunch and hanging around. There was also a lot of tourists. Fortunately there is free Wifi and toilets. I thought it was bigger after reading a Wikipedia review of it, it is big but the local market in Montreal, Canada is probably the same size if not bigger. But here you can find products from all over Europe, and very good ones. To have lynch is less expensive than in most London restaurants and probably better. Even if it is cheaper than in restaurants the exchange rate for Canadians just kills it...(1.90) So when you end up paying 5.5$ or 3 pounds for one corn on the cob, you think twice...otherwise, if money is no object go and run for it. As with all public markets, there are good picture opportunities, but mpre on the high end style food boutiques.||August 7, 2014
Welshwolves||50||We found this on our last day in London and we wished we had found it days earlier.The food was of fantastic quality and variety ideal for if you want to make a picnic or great food to eat there.||August 7, 2014
Nunngo||50||So glad we stumbled pass this market unexpectedly, good choice of international foods and a relaxed atmosphere. Recommend the vegetarian Indian food, verp||August 6, 2014
Bill A||50||One of the best places to hang out and grad food in London. Everything from oysters, fish and chips, fresh meats, and sweets are available here. Worth spending time here for lunch and making yourself want to eat everything offered here.||August 6, 2014
pb56422||40||Visited after exploring Camden Market for most of day and should have checked first but on Tuesdays it is not fully open - really just for take away food and the odd stall selling sweets and buscuits and such like. All good stuff but not the lively place from Wednesday on and the fruit and veg stalls were not there. A lesson to check opening times in future!||August 5, 2014
Dom J||50||Visited here a few times now, and its always brilliant, great atmosphere and great food, its just a place you have to visit at least once||August 5, 2014
incite_wanderlust||50||We love Borough Market and yeah it's crowded and there are tourists but food and drink is fantastic and there is always a chance to taste new things.We chanced by at 4.45 on a Saturday and picked up delicious mozzarella, fantastic game pie and delicious wild boar pie and some sweet sweet cherry tomatoes all at bargain knock down prices. The only problem was not eating them all before we got the train home that evening!||August 5, 2014
Linda M||30||It's been years since I visited Borough Market and it has become very much a haven for those who like fine, unique foods. The atmosphere on a Saturday afternoon was hectic and it was very cramped - wouldn't advise pushchairs, wheelchairs or dogs (easy to get trod on!) but was great for a couple who had time to spare. Lots and lots of stalls and the opportunity to try different foods - if you're prepared to stand and be jostled whilst eating. We found Maria's kiosk (I think it was called that) serving good, old fashioned fry-up, burgers, etc cooked by italian 'mama's' and it was the best bacon, egg and chips that I've had in years!||August 5, 2014
Fernlay||50||I just wish I lived closer! All the produce looked and was amazing. I bought a mix of tiny multi coloured tomatoes and fresh basil from one stall, and a beautiful mozzarella from another. that was the starter for the evening sorted. then the best Conte I have ever tasted was selected for after dinner. All this and a bottle of wine along the way. A spectacular market. Everyone who enjoys food should go. Can't wait to return. we had already eaten at Rabot 1745, but next time we will graze through the market.||August 5, 2014
Tawny12||40||This farmer's market on weekends is a must go!It's open air at one end so it does get a little dreary if it's raining. Otherwise this is the perfect place to try very good food and buy wonderful local produce!I always make it a point to visit each time I'm in London!||August 5, 2014
Zoerodda||50||Went on a Friday afternoon..........absolutely amazing. We ate raclettes, pulled pork sandwiches, baklava with a Turkish coffee, cakes, pates, drank mulled cider and so forth. How we rolled ourselves on the train home I do not know! Highly recommended||August 4, 2014
LoraxGirl||50||Grab food for a picnic, or grab eats for any meal of the day. Pimm's to go, they've got it! Ready made breakfast/lunch/dinner... they've got that too. Meat pies, scotch eggs, sausages, craft beers, fruit, baked goods, and so much more. We were there during a weekday and hit the business lunch crowd. Nice to see locals enjoying the market as well as tourists.||August 4, 2014
mwooduk||40||Hubby and I went here for lunch after we visited the amazing Old Operating Theatre museum just across the street. I had a pie from the Pieminster stand which contained steak, bacon and New Zealand ale and it was fantastic for about 4 UKL. There is sadly nowhere to sit and eat so you have to eat standing up but it was hard choosing from all the great street vendors. The market is very historic and do take time while you are there to look at the old photos/info about the market back years ago. Bustling place and gets really busy after 12 noon.||August 4, 2014
GeorgeIII||40||Went here Saturday morning/afternoon - if you can't find wonderful food here you won't find it anywhere. The choice and quality is amazing. I'd thoroughly recommend a visit to the New Forest Cider Bar - excellent ciders and knowledgable staff.Only down side - poor public loos! ||August 4, 2014
hope-for-the-best||50||I highly recommend this place near London Brdige !! Don't miss "Sylvie" the fruit merchant, with her delicious "fresh cut fruit cups" to go...And the superb British pies for an affordable price !! FISH is the place to be too !! A nice way to rest before your visit to BRITISH MUSEUM of ARTS, on the docks nearby..||August 4, 2014
nikko1974UK||50||Try to avoid Saturdays if you want to go shopping. Otherwise be prepared for tons of tourists and locals wandering around the stalls. Apart from the excellent quality produce there are loads of options for breakfast/lunch at the market. I recommend the caramelized duck sandwich sold on a stall close to Stoney Street. I tried the Argentine empanadas and they were not good at all. A very bad copy from the original ones....||August 4, 2014
Inflection||30||Visited this place to look for a cheese sandwich shop. Didn't find the shop till after we ate our lunch so a little bit bummed out but there's a wide variety of food, both cooked and uncooked for your senses to indulge in if you're so inclined.||August 3, 2014
ooiki||40||Visited the market on a Saturday morning as it is within walking distance from our hotel. Lots and lots of food, to eat and to pack for takeaway. An enjoyable morning stroll. ||August 3, 2014
ReviewChimp||50||I've found myself on jollies to London countless times over the years. I've always found something new and there's always something to draw you back. What I've never done is visit Borough Market until now.A stone's throw from London Bridge tube station this market is packed full of goodies. Fruit and veg stalls, juice stands, bakers, chocolates, and food stalls by the plenty.We arrived early morning and it was already pretty busy and by lunchtime it was rammed. If you don't like crowds then pop in early otherwise be prepared to move at a snail's pace.From friends we've been told that this is the place to go for street food and it didn't disappoint. A half shelf of scallips, veg and bacon bits went down well, as did some three cheese pastry thing, and juices were gratefully gulped down as the sun bore down on us.I love markets and this is probably the king of them, full of sights, sounds, and awesome smells.However one thing did spoil it and that was a presumably local woman whining about the number of tourists there but I'm fairly sure the market stall owners will have thought differently.Still, great place to visit||August 3, 2014
Andreza B||50||Borough Market is the biggest food market in London and there is something for all tastes. The restaurants around are also amazing! Don't miss the cheese stalls and the exotic ostrich burger!||August 3, 2014
Maxximvs||40||We stumbled upon this market by mistake, not realizing out hotel was very close by. I had a great burger and all the vendor street food looked delicious. One key to eating in these places is making sure they have the traffic to ensure the food is rotated and fresh each time. You can tell here that the lunch crowds were very happy with the food and service. I asked several locals and they make this their daily lunch stop on a regular basis.Cheap, good and on the go, what else do you want ?||August 3, 2014
magicelixer||50||Great variety of food vendors -- both prepared and raw ingredients. Get there early if possible and grab breakfast. After 1pm it gets quite crowded. Wish I had purchased some of the unusual and uniquely British foods to bring home as gifts. The market is close to the Globe theatre and Tate Modern if you want to make a day of it.||August 2, 2014
dizzyfizzy45||40||Visited Borough Market for the first time having heard about it from others .Lovely foods on sale .Stalls look very inviting .Very clean .Just going to enjoy the cakes we bought there .||August 2, 2014
lillyaa||50||If you're into food, this is a must see! if you're not, you might be converted. You can eat fresh oyster, buy truffles, find every fruit and veg you can think of and taste gorgeous food from around the world.||August 1, 2014
TomekGo||50||Me and my wife go to borough market very often and we love everything apart of vegetarian food options. I had today absolutely amazing wild boar sausage hot dog and my wife (veg) went for stall next to it with halumi burger - it was very poor and disappointing. She paid £7 where I paid £4.50 for mine...||August 1, 2014
Ira A||50||Going to Borough Market every Saturday is a bit of a tradition. There is so much to try and buy. One of my favorites is the duck confit sandwich at Le Marche Du Quartier and of course coffee at Monmouth. Can never get enough.||August 1, 2014
kingswoodweymouth||50||Years ago this was a run of the mill little market. It is now vast and trendy with food from around the world. Watched it grow since the 70's. Love all the vibes and the food is still great. Not to be missed. ||July 31, 2014
Alex M||50||Interesting and great market, worth visiting. There is food from everywhere and everything looks so good it is hard to make a decision. We ended up getting a German Bratwurst and Indian curry which were both excellent. It was very busy and full without feeling stressful but instead creating a great atmosphere.||July 31, 2014
fortunate60||30||Bought different varieties of sugared coated and chocolate nuts however the nuts were soft - would definitely recommend you taste before you buy||July 30, 2014
ceciliamorrison||50||What a wonderful market, I had problems remembering that I was in London, and not in France or somewhere similar. The stalls are well laid our with plenty of room around for people to walk and ponder and buy. There is masses to look at, all tempting to purchase too. Wonderful vegetables, fruits of every variety that one could think of. Fresh fish of several different species. Cheeses, spices, cakes, breads, confectionary including delicious fudge! Juices are on offer too. Get the picture! It is undercover, so no worries if it is raining. It is situated not far from both London Bridge Tube station and the main station.||July 30, 2014
iluvmyholz||50||Walked past this by chance looking for the clink prison museum! Omg id just had breakfast so unfortunately couldnt get anything too filling! If only id known id stumble upon it...!the sights and smells of this place i didnt know where to look first!!

CTtravelersCt||50||This market is crowded but full of wonderful foods to bring home or eat on the spot. We even found a quiet pub nearby that would let us bring in food from the market if we ordered drinks.If you visit the market be sure to stop at the Market offices, where you can pick up free Market Guides and other information. My packet included a lovely brochure with clever graphics called The History, People and products of the Borough Market.....it has profiles of vendors and their businesses. Charming!||July 29, 2014
JoeGB||50||We enjoyed a great selection of food, wine and fun. The Spanish paella alone is worth the visit. Plenty of choices and fun to wander around and sample||July 29, 2014
Exiles||40||Fantastic selection of fresh, homemade, regional food and drink, a real foodies paradise. Try the salted beef bagels, sample the fresh, homemade donuts or some pad Thai. Walk off your snacks by following the river south to Tower Bridge.So close to the tourist sites of the Tate and the Thames you have no excuse to miss it.||July 29, 2014
Bridget R||50||Opens on a Thursday to Saturday and sells everything a foody can dream of. Can get very busy on a Saturday afternoon so an early visit is better. You won't regret the visit||July 29, 2014
David B||50||Love the Borough Market by the London Bridge. You can see it on Saturday's, and you can get to it from the Big Bus Tours also. Amazing food, produce, seafood, pastries, brads and homemade sangria. So fun to look at everything. They also have food stalls which smell amazing.||July 28, 2014
jerseykathyl||50||We took a stroll round this market on a busy Saturday afternoon and really enjoyed taking in all the many smells and sights. There are so many food stalls, we were spoilt for choice but ended up with a delicious hog roast. The other stalls selling fresh bread, cheese etc also looked amazing – never seen so much wonderful food in one place! Definitely worth a visit to tempt your tastebuds!||July 28, 2014
asquill||40||Great & varied food mainly brought from outside London. Well presented stalls and some interesting restaurants for all pockets. Buying produce from the stalls, however interesting & varied they may be, is not cheap. Many points of interest along the Southbank are easily walks from here which makes it an excellent place to centre a half day's walk||July 28, 2014
XHuang||50||My wife and I went to Borough Markets for lunch on one of the days we visited London. Very easy to get to by tube and loved it. There are so many food stalls (all different types of cuisines) to choose from and all relatively cheap. You will likely spend a while deciding what you will actually buy as everything looks and smells delicious. We ended up getting some scotch eggs and a pie from Bristol, both were delicious. In total we spent about 15-20 pounds for a nice lunch. Great place to stopover for some food when in London! Highly recommended for all lovers of food!||July 28, 2014
SwindonGolfer||40||Great food and lots of it. Lovely displays and plenty of atmosphere. Best to go early though as it does get very busy||July 28, 2014
Kat E||50||Take your appetite, your camera and some money, honey, so any good things to try and to buy. Start with a insulated shopping bag from Liam and the work your way around the market. Incredible cheese, breads, olives, juice drinks, meat pies, fish- all kinds, meat you can't even begin to imagine eating, giant pans of deliciousness goodness, homemade cakes and chocolates and my fav .....a grilled cheese, red onion and finely chopped leeks sandwich! YUMSo memorably good||July 27, 2014
Guilherme_Menegassi||50||I spent a wonderful morning at the Borough Market! The variety of options is amazing. Lots and lots of places to eat, drink and purchase groceries. ||July 27, 2014
RAMESHSHIRALI||50||Be it Cheese, Pastry, Pie, Cheese, Paela, Game, Seafood, Fish & Chips, Fruits, Juices, Dry fruits, Cured meats, Cold cuts....you name it and you have it. International cuisine...Indian, Mediterranean, Italian, Spanish, English, Vietnamese....just everything. My favourite is the Fried Quail Eggs and Khanom Krok a Thai street food joint. Borough Market is a must whenever I am in London. Stones throw from the London Bridge Tube station.Must visit, don't miss||July 27, 2014
Steve R||50||Such a diverse range of food- make sure you starve yourself before going so you can eat to your heart's content. Everything interesting you could ever imagine is there, and ready to eat!!||July 26, 2014
Theonlytommo||40||The market offers places to eat and drink. We chose Black and Blue. Lucky to get a table as absolutely packed. Good food and service. The market is popular with local workers after work. ||July 26, 2014
daren1970||40||Went to borough maker with my wife and spent a good few hours there. Lots of stalls to look at and buy from and get food and drink samples from but be carefull some of the stalls will cost you a small fortune.the pubs around borough market are all good and we both had a good afternoon out||July 26, 2014
John26England||40||A fascinating place to spend an hour or so without having to spending any money although you will probably be tempted by all the wonderful fresh produce on show!||July 25, 2014
Faith_and_Me||40||Great venue and atmosphere here. The food stalls are great and the smells very enticing. You can't go past the corned beef sandwiches, however I also went for the roast hog and apple sauce ciabatta. Great, great, great!||July 24, 2014
Charmainee||40||If you are a foodie or a avid cook, you must make a trip here! Not a very big market, but interesting enough to visit. There are food stalls selling freshly baked bread, sandwiches, burgers, juices, paella, fresh oysters! And yes, there is a processo bar! An outlet of the Monmouth cafe is located just outside the market. Long queue but the queue moves quite quickly. There are also stalls selling fresh farmer produce and artisan products. Bought myself a fine bottle of extra virgin olive oil, a small tub of Fleur de Sel and some dried lavender for baking. Very pleased!Just a 3 mins walk from London Bridge tube station. Better to go early. I went on a Wed morning, and it wasn't crowded at all! Most stalls do not have any seatings. Spent less than 2 hours there browsing and eating. ||July 24, 2014
xxpinksaltxx||50||Certainly worth a visit. All of the food looks amazing (and what we tried was amazing too). If a foodie you could easily wander around for many hours on end. It does get quite busy during the lunch time though. We tried the focaccia at Bread Ahead and also a fresh watermelon juice from one of the fruit stands. All the fresh produce is very nice, and vendors are keen for you to try their offerings.||July 24, 2014
Tara B||50||This is probably the best market I have ever been to and I have been to many!!!!!! There are stalls selling food and drink from all over the world and it dazzles the senses. Almost all of the stall will let you sample their wares and that can be an experience in itself. The array of foods is overwhelming, but in a completely good way and I defy anyone to go there and come away empty handed, I know I didn't. I highly recommend this market as a must if you have a few hours to spare. Being next door to Southwark Cathedral means that it is very easy to find so give it a visit!||July 24, 2014
carolvgm||50||I'be been to Borough Market last october, but I was with my in laws, so no away to eat street food. But I was wondering how good would it be to pick up smalls portions of food and taste as much my stomach can handle.So, we'd come back this july to London and Borough Market was on my list "to go" and "to eat".Great great time. Wonderful experience. And great cost (yeaaah!)It was me, my husband e my toddler. We all ate falafel wrap, gyozas, sausages, paella, burratas, proscuitto crudo, organic iced tea, bread and finished with the most delicious brownie ever.And we bought burrata to eat later at the hotel, of course. It's the classical street food, with great quality, great service. Little bit crowded, but... who cares? I'm not at a restaurant! I'm at a street food market having great time.Go there with no prejudices. Eat as long as you can. And as the british always says: enjoy!!||July 24, 2014
109sophiea||50||I work in London Bridge and therefore this is really close for me, often meet up here for a bit of lunch with work colleagues & family or pop down here for lunch alone - would highly recommend grabbing the Baileys cheesecake from the cheesecake stall or the sweet potato fries in the food market! Really nice in the summer or even to walk around on your lunch break.||July 24, 2014
joseflores2268||40||In a Wednesday, at 3:00 is possible to have a good food after a long walk at London, plenty diverse food, from different countries, no so cheap but high quality, fruit, vegetarian and organics are available, truffle stuff are the best for those who are looking for cook ingredients.||July 24, 2014
MJfromNJ||50||I'd give Borough Market 100 stars if I could. During past trips to London, I visited all the Big Sites -- you know, the Tower of London, Harrod's, the Tate, the Imperial War Museum, etc. -- all wonderful and amazing. But this time, an English friend told me to meet him at Borough Market and I was just blown away. My jaw dropped at practically every food stall -- and I've been to many food markets in many cities in the US and Europe. (By the way, Borough Market is a much more enjoyable experience than Harrod's food court which is painfully expensive and crowded.) We ate our way through so many amazing food stalls -- many offer free tastes. I had to buy some black truffle oil to bring home with me. The Spanish section was breathtaking -- the paella, the handsome young Spanish men slicing up the Spanish ham (!). Oh, the produce! The pastries! I still have dreams about the shockingly good cream-filled donuts from Bread Ahead. I've never been a huge cream donut fan, but I'm not kidding -- you MUST have one (preferably more than one). My biggest regret is that I went to Borough Market on a Saturday, and they didn't reopen until several days later, when I had left London. Check their schedule online and make sure you leave at least 2 hours to tour around and eat as much as you can. Borough Market will definitely be my #1 stop in London for all future visits.||July 23, 2014
Alistair M||50||Just take a walk through the re-vamped Market. This is Foodie Heaven. Fresh food, food to go, restaurants, cafes - just an amazing selection of Cuisines. I particularly like the Lobster at F!sh - but that is just me. If you want a really good alternative have the fish or sausage at the takeaway counter.||July 23, 2014
Mildred T||50||The best food of our trip. Scottish Scotch Eggs, perfect! German bratwurst the best, short of getting to Germany, and still maybe it's here in London! The market offers so much. A must for all. We were able to make it a second time, and wished we could have gone some more.||July 21, 2014
Bruce T||50||Just next to London Bridge Underground, Borough Market exudes atmosphere and wonderful aromas. There's a Slow Food snail trail including 23 London members. One of the most famous is Neal's Yard Diary where my Brussels' friend Nick always used to buy his excellent Stilton.From Turkish Deli to bread, olive oil, French cheese, English fruit and veg; this is a food lover's paradise. There are plenty of places to eat and drink, especially in the attractive pubs which surround the market. We enjoyed a lunchtime pint in the retro Wheatsheaf Yard.Great views of the Shard and don't miss the contrast with historic Southwark Cathedral....||July 21, 2014
JaneHT||50||What a find, don't be put of by initial appearances, this was a real find. Loved it, especially the wine place! Loads to see, do and sample, fantastic!||July 21, 2014
Tracey-ann E||50||Fabulous day out ... Saturday is a perfect day to have a mooch about Makes me want to move to London !!! Fresh produce great atmosphere||July 20, 2014
Hannah48||50||We always visit Borough Market when visiting London. It is an absolute must if you love food (English and Continental). We went on a Saturday morning and yes it was very busy but this adds to the atmosphere. As well as looking at all the meat, fish, fruit, cake, bread, cheese and vegetable stalls, there are wine and beer stalls. We bought some lovely bread from an Italian stall. You can also "eat your way round" Borough Market. There is so much to choose from including sausage buns, venison burgers, curries, paella and vegetarian. If you love food do visit.||July 20, 2014
Chappaqua3||50||This is like Smorgasburg in Brooklyn--only better. An amazing selection of prepared foods with vendors selling fresh ingredients as well. Absolutely the widest selection I have seen at a food market. The only negative is is that there is no place to sit. SO you either have to walk with what you are eating or be willing to sit on the ground, which is what we did. If you love food, this is an absolute MUST when you visit London.||July 20, 2014
Kieran S||40||Cute market, went on a Friday during lunch hour and wasn't too packed. Many different stands with good food and desserts. Above-average farmers market.||July 20, 2014
matthew_vanderheide||50||It doesn't seem to matter what time of day you come here, it is always packed! You will find everything in this little market, especially people unwinding after a long or short day with a cold beer in hand. I highly recommend that you visit this place at around 5-6pm before the crowd gets bigger as it can be difficult to find a seat (or standing space) otherwise it is worth a walk through just to watch the people!||July 20, 2014
857kristinh||40||We were visiting in late June and stopped in to the Burough market for lunch. It was very, very crowded but that was part of the experience. Lots of choices. Seems to be where the locals go after work.||July 20, 2014
Rachel C||50||Borough Market seemed to be where local young professionals go to grab a quick bite after work. It's a bit overwhelming and chaotic but adds to there experience. Found a great little falafel stand in the back and delicious fresh juice from another stand. Probably the cheapest meal we had during our London trip though we had to eat on the street corner standing up. Well worth the visit! ||July 19, 2014
goobs_tommo||50||I lived in London for several years and never considered Borough Markets as a place to visit. It's a short, scenic walk from the Tate at Southbank to the markets. There are plenty of bars, restaurants, and of course the food market.||July 18, 2014
noelster||50||Borough market is the best food market i have visited, if you like cooking/food take the time and stop by. Great selection from teas to breads, cheeses, meats and fish. Grab a bite at the food stalls on the way in then taste the samples from the stalls in the main market.||July 18, 2014
Laura M||50||I can't believe I haven't discovered this London gem before! A great, bustling semi-open market, with tasters being given out on nearly every stall - no excuse not to try before you buy! We ended up eating a beautiful paella and sipping Prosecco on the cobbles - such a relaxed, budget lunch right in the heart of the capital. Only wish we had gone later in the day so I could have bought some artisan pork pie to take home!||July 18, 2014
gnowkeenz||40||You will need to set aside say 1.5 hours to squeeze through the crowds, buy some stuff and munch along at the Borough Market. It is a relatively small place but truly a place filled with good food. We tried two bacon burgers (from different stores) and we preferred the one that is at the corner (don't remember the name of the shop). Do try them and grab some wine or beer! Enjoy!||July 18, 2014
hope2like||40||Great food market with lots of variety and much to sample. Opens at 10am and on the Thursday we went, it got very crowded by noon. Highly recommend an early start.||July 17, 2014
JoseHulle||50||Nice market, great ambiance. We ate super soul food. However, the litter in the small park near Green dragon place was awfull.||July 16, 2014
123jo63||50||A fantastic market for food lovers, selling a large variety of ingredients to take home, and food stalls for tasting and eating! Good quality food. Highly recommend.||July 16, 2014
Col F||50||4 of us went for lunch on friday and spent ages wandering around taking in the sights and smells.A totally absorbing time.Loads of different foods and lots to taste.People were very friendly and the food was great.If you are anywhere near London Bridge, take time out to visit. You won't be disappointed.||July 16, 2014
IndigoJT||50||I recently visited this market for the first time......this is the Mother of all food markets - and I have been to many! Just steps away from the London Bridge tube station and close to The Shard building and Southwark Cathedral this market has it all for the avid foodie! I loved the various cheese stalls (lots of free samples of some of the most amazing cheeses I have ever had), fresh produce, juice bars, meat stalls and wonderful bakery stalls in the market section. Cross the little street at the back for an unending array of food stands offering all kinds of ready to eat ethnic foods. We wandered the whole lineup before deciding on wonderful raclette and some great vegetarian indian food. The organic juice bar has a great selection of healthy juices, but there are also prosecco bars, Pimms bars and some wine bars, great coffee and a shop selling Spanish food items. I can't wait to go back. The market is open Thursdays, Friday and Saturdays. Good idea to check the website for opening times and any changes.||July 16, 2014
KarinP63||50||This is one of London's oldest markets and the food on offer was sensational and including cheese, mushrooms and small goods I never seen before. I was there on a Saturday and the crowd was huge but polite and a little difficult to navigate. Many of the stalls had samples of their ware and everything was delicious. There were so many eateries the decision regarding where to dine for lunch was one of the hardest ever.||July 14, 2014
Erin_Mc8||50||A lovely food market right by the Thames. A great way to spend your day and a chance to taste some excellent food.||July 14, 2014
Graham240364||50||This market is just across the road from the George Inn and well worth a visit. The cheese and Ice Cream stalls offer tasty choices and amazing value. Organic vegetables and unusual gifts available.||July 12, 2014
ArunRatnam||40||Located within a couple of minutes walk of London Bridge station, spanning a few lanes, the place is cluttered with small stalls of all kinds .... can get very crowded and difficult to navigate through the crowds at the wrong time... but we were lucky it was not bad at all when we went around 1030 AM on Saturday. Lots and lots of stalls selling all kinds of foods, some mundane, some truly exotic... some ready to eat street food, some packaged . You name it, you get it, including game meat, ostrich, kangaroo.... if you have the curiosity and the appetite. There are also stalls selling pasta, fruit juices, ice creams, indian street food, ethipian café, gujarathi food including a limited thali, paella, various other ready to eat products..... but more Interestingly, there are shops and shops offering various kinds of speciality breads, sausages, meats, preserves, spices, sauces and dressings, oils, organic foods, chocolates, Turkish delight and baklava, fruits vegetables . drinks.... oh oh oh !!! A gourmet's delight really..... though you should not question where when and how the food was made. Much of the food is also kept in the open, so likely to pick up some street dust and assorted debris from the walking feet as they go past. But clearly the place is very popular with those wanting something different from staid old supermarket fare.... I was sorely tempted but restrained myself from getting carried away....As most of the food is upmarket and very expensive.... so the connoisseur who is willing to spend can have a ball !!||July 12, 2014
Peter S||40||It's hard to imagine a more comprehensive selection of high quality produce in a market outside France! The stallholders are enthusiasts for their products and happy to share their knowledge. Apart from fresh produce there is an extensive range of stalls selling good quality street food ranging from salt beef sandwiches (some are large enough to feed two for lunch) to paella. The market is open from Wednesday - Saturday. However, be warned that during the tourist season it can be very crowded on Fridays and Saturdays and particularly so around lunch time.Well worth a visit.||July 12, 2014
Florence S||40||Great fun to just see what the market sells and to sample bread/cheese/mustard/olives etc. A jar of mustard was 5 pounds, and it tasted amazing. The Indian food was great. Public restrooms are available. Overall fun.||July 11, 2014
Lis H||40||Borough markets are an excellent stop for a snack a wander or lunch. Providores of excellent fresh produce artesian bakers, cheese makers, and drinks and spices tempt you as you wander through. There is no seating to enjoy your purchases but we were advised to sit in the church yard next door which worked fine... And we discovered a lovely old church into the bargain.Nearby is the Globe theatre, London Bridge, pubs, cafes, and a great walk from one side of the Thames across the Millennium Bridge down the embankment across the Waterloo Bridge and back up the other side. Well worth a visit as you can get photos of most land marks from the many bridges, such as Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, the Shard, the London Eye.||July 10, 2014
Retiree9||50||Great ambience. quality produce, cheeses, meats etc. Try a coffee or chocolate drink at "Hotel Chocolat" and learn how the chocolate is made.||July 10, 2014

It's a display of food for many cultures around the world. We tried the pastries, german sandwich and pad thai, all of them are soo delicious. The prices are reasonable. It's a must for people visiting London.||July 9, 2014
johannabanana2014||50||had planned to visit this on a Mon to find out that it wasnt open so only had a brief visit on the Sat. Great place if you like markets and/or food. Awful place if you dont like crowds. Wonderful assortment of all types of food with small amount of food related craft stalls. I got 2lbs of juicy cherries for £2, and a mouth-watering Salt-beef sandwich - sooo tasty.Definately worth a visit - but dont go if youre hungry - you will eat and buy all around you!||July 8, 2014
Chocobubaloo||50||Borough Market was magically vibrant in colors and smells. If you find yourself hungry in London (like I did) you can easily make a meal of free samples of bread, cheese, and chocolate. Everyone who works at this market loves their job and is passionate about what they are selling or making, so you will find many friendly faces who are willing to help you with whatever you want or need. I visited four markets while I was in London and this one was my favorite.||July 8, 2014
Angela P||50||First time at Borough Market on Saturday, often seen the crowds as I've passed by. What a brilliant atmosphere, and the smells of culinary delights from around the World as you walk through. Not the place to be if your on a diet, but the place to be if you want to try a taste of something different. We were visiting my sister for a few days and it was one of the highlights. Would definitely go again and spend more time there. For visitors so easy to find, get off at London Bridge and cross the road.||July 7, 2014
Liam120189||50||Great food! Great atmosphere! You won't just go once. The food is all fresh produce. Whilst nothing is cheap its not more expensive than local bars or restaurants. Definitely worth a visit||July 7, 2014
Kirsty R||50||If you are a foodie like me this is a great market. There are plenty of free samples and the food was reasonably priced for London (I thought). There was a diverse choice of food from traditional pies to curry to noodles. I loved every moment and would return in an instant. The atmosphere was charming however very busy in small spaces. Also, there was not a lot of seating so if you have trouble standing or walking for long period of times then I would suggest a bit of research. Maybe a few cafes or bars to rest the legs etc. I would suggest taking a bag that wraps around you for money etc. I had a backpack however this just had my clothes in and I kept expensive belongings close. It is cramped and a busy city so stay aware of your belongings as it could lead to being an easy target. Overall, great market that was very yummy.||July 7, 2014
degtravel||40||This market is a lot of fun but prices are high and queues are long.... this is London after all.Ideal place when you are on a relaxing visit to London.There are many bars and pubs across the market. There is even a bar with only English wines.A must when in you have a few hours to spend in London.||July 6, 2014
HenryWilson||50||The noise! The smells! The tastes! The hustle and bustle!If you have any kind of love for food, and see it as something far more important than the fuel to keep your body ticking, then a visit to Borough Market is essential, when in Town.We combined a mooch around here with lunch at fish! and a visit to View From The Shard, and this trio made for a wonderful afternoon.The street food on offer is fabulous and 'almost' rivals Camden. The cheeses and chocolates and seafood and fudges and meats were amazing! Take the opportunity to sample 'everything' that you possibly can. Even if you don't like the sound of it. You just might have a really pleasant surprise.For me, this is a 'must do' for any visitor to London.||July 6, 2014
bdcalc||50||The food was diverse, reasonably priced, and delicious! The atmosphere was charming. Only drawback was that there was not more seating available.||July 6, 2014
Devi I||50||Love this place and looking forward to returning as soon as I can. we went early Saturday morning while some vendors were still setting up and had no issues with crowds. Great variety as we enjoyed a beautiful wild game burger and sausage bap. Meat was flavourful and moist and the women working in the van friendly and smiling. Grabbed some coffee at Monmouth coffee shop outside and devoured the amazing pastries with my eyes. Next door we got the 3 for £5 brownies which we spent the rest of our trip just dreaming about getting again. Back inside the market we enjoyed baklava, honey macadamias (tasted like sweet popcorn!), chocolate cinnamon nuts, juicy strawberries and raspberries and fresh juice. Then there's the deli meats and cheeses which we couldn't properly try given the nature of our trip. Enthusiastically recommend going to this market and looking forward to my return trip.||July 6, 2014
PinkCad2||50||... for the smells, the freshness, the displays, the location, the atmosphere, the variety, the novelties, the fun, the humour, the tastings, the quality, the knowledge and the sheer pleasure the staff takes in telling you about their product. Certain to leave with a warm heart, full belly and a smile on your face.||July 6, 2014
MJT155019||50||I always try and make a stop here when in London. This time was able to go with the whole family. Scheduled our visit to coincide with tickets to Julius Caesar at the Globe. We took tour in the morning, walked to the market for lunch and then back for 2:00 performance. Our teenage sons loved the good at the stalls, Moo and Blue pie at Pieminister was a favourite. Cheeses are fabulous here. Visit also nearby Neal's Yard for cheese heaven. ||July 6, 2014
Tara B||50||We decided to visit Borough Market as a spur of the minute idea instead of the usual weekend routine of shopping and cleaning and I am so glad we did! The last time I had visited the market was about 25years ago so I knew it would have changed a lot and boy had it! It had grown in size and the traders are far more diverse which is a reflection on our changing food tastes and of the diverse population of the surrounding area. You can buy anything from cherries to cheese, liver to legumes. All fresh, all organic and all of high quality housed in a area that is electric, eclectic and historic. The atmosphere is hustle and bustle, noisy and heavily perfumed with the smells of cooking meats, coffee and spices that assaults the senses in a good way. We had a very good couple of hours wandering around, having tasters and spending money! I would highly recommend a visit.||July 5, 2014
NicT80||40||A great way to eat your way through London. Definitely try the Poole Harbour oysters, and the scallops with lots of bacon on top. The Ethiopian food stall has a long line, but it's worth the wait. DELICIOUS! Wash it down with the locally made lemonade.||July 5, 2014
664DavidT||50||The first thing you have to do is walk around and soak in all the different smells, which are amazing all by themselves. Another reason to walk around first is so you can get an idea how many different choices you will have (and no, you won't get to try everything that you want, even with several visits). THEN go back and start eating. You will not go wrong with any stand that you choose, whether you try meats, cheeses, breads, or desserts. Well worth a visit.||July 5, 2014
couponqueenks||50||This place is filled with every epicurean delight you could imagine. Grab of glass of Pim's or sangria and stroll around to all of the food stalls. Order a montgomery cheddar toasted cheese sandwich with leeks and onions at Kappacasein. Delish. Or if you are after fish and chips, visit fish kitchen for a large portion of this traditional British meal.||July 5, 2014
alexandrec68||40||If you're looking for a world food it's the best place. So many kind of food. It's a place to visit and try some food. ||July 4, 2014
SophieAngell||50||We went for Breakfast (And lunch for that matter!) and consumed in no particular order; The Most Delicious Halloumi Burger In The World from the Veg Men, An outrageous chocolate marble brownie from the cake shop next to Monmouth Coffee shop (which is awesome), Spanish Tortilla, a doughnut and croissant from Bread Ahead, a juicy slice of watermelon and £12.50's worth of Turkish Delight. Take cash (or get some out from the Barclays outside London Bridge Tube station which is literally round the corner. Prepare for it to be busy (we went on a Sat morning) but it's totally worth it. Just make sure you go on an empty stomach!||July 4, 2014
DibiaD||50||A colorful tasting wonderful experience! Great food everywhere you can go all around the word just eating traditional food from different countries! ||July 4, 2014
kentcritique||50||A gastronomers heaven - bustling market full of dozens and dozens of wonderful stalls selling a huge array of the very best in food and drink - and more !Prepare to be amazed and delighted so much to try and buy,Do avoid the weekends if you can - as you cannot move for the crowds aThursday is best as all stalls open and it is bearable to get around and about without it being like the 1st day of the sales. !!||July 3, 2014
BradJill||40||The Borough Market is a place we always enjoy spending a bit of time, seeing what the vendors have to offer, trying out some of the French cheeses, locally produced sausages and breads, Turkish Baklava, fresh fruits, juices, organic vegetables or whatever takes our fancy... During summer visits, we find it best to stop by during the late morning before the lunch crowd arrives. At this time, the stalls and various vendors are setup and ready to go but the crowds are not too bad. Plus, you get early picks on the foods, which is nice! Further, during and after lunch, its busier then we like, especially if you are wanting to take pictures. We very much enjoy buying a few bits of food and drinks at the Borough Market and proceeding over to the River Thames riverside area to find a place to enjoy them while taking in the views. During the summer when the weather is better, this is a very enjoyable way to have a lunch in this part of the city.In addition to admiring (and trying) the foods, make sure to have a look at the building structure as well. The covered market area makes good use of green coloured cast iron capitals, columns, tracery and roof support that adds a nice architectural dimension to a visit to the Borough Markets. In the end, this is a very good food market that can be easily visited if you plan to spend time around in the Southwark area of London.||July 3, 2014
Technospaz||50||London's Borough Market has been around for a long while and has always provided visitors with a plethora of dining and drinking choices. By "dining," I mean the wide variety of stalls which serve quick and yummy meals. And, by "drinking," I mean the various guzzling choices including wines (as well as sparkling wines & champagne), fruit juices, shakes and coffee! And for those who aren't hungry or thirsty, there are stalls which sell handicraft, art pieces, fancy crockery etc. so you'll never go bored.The entire market is very well laid out and there is more than ample room to walk around (even for those with a stroller). While it can get a bit crowded, it never really feels too suffocating. The market is also shaded so while it may rain or drizzle (and that happens often), you won't need to worry about getting wet. For food choices, I strongly recommend:1. The roast pork belly & bramley apple sauce sandwich (from Roast). This is divine!2. The salt beef sandwich which comes with pickled cucumber and mustard. Yum!3. The Spanish seafood paella. Excellent on a cold day.4. The pan-seared scallops with bacon & veggie bits (from Shellseekers). 5. The various stalls selling fresh fruits - you'll never tire from seeing the array of colours :)(And these are just my preferred stalls out of the many in one half of the market!) For any foodie (or even a first-time visitor to London), visiting the market is a must. While the prices of food, drinks, fruits, handicraft etc. are on the high side, don't let that put you off. The Borough Market is popular with tourists and for good reason too! Getting to the Borough Market is also easy. It's just outside the London Bridge tube station. A short walk up the stairs to the ground level and you can't miss it. So, getting there and back is a breeze. Aside from coming to the market with an empty stomach (so that you can savour the food and drink), come with a sturdy shopping bag too - I'm sure you'll pick things up as you walk around!||July 3, 2014
anniwhere||40||Really enjoyed my visit here. Very nice selection of food, drink and sweets. A perfect place to walk around and relax. As it is roofed it is also a good choice for a rainy day.||July 3, 2014
Looschie||40||Really cool market that offers LOADS of different things to look at, buy and eat. We unfortunately only stopped through very briefly due to time but would love to go back and spend more time walking around.Get the sausage on a stick, it's DELISH!!||July 3, 2014

bitey27||40||This market is quite an experience. Packed with people, it is a gastronome's paradise. Huge array of food from every culture, plus beautiful displays of fruit and veg, cheeses, truffles and weird and wonderful cuts of meat and seafood. Stalls around the outer edges cook and sell plates of all manner of gourmet meals. Noisy, crowded, the air thick with delicious aromas, this is a great place to visit.||July 2, 2014
Ken C||50||Came upon this will site seeing in London. Came around a corner and there it was. What a great enviroment. Lots of different foods and the prices were excellent. Good value for what you got. Will make it a stop on my next trip to london and would recommend it as a stop for anyone site seeing in London.||July 2, 2014
HAVEFUN000||50||If you want exceptional street food, this is the place! The market is open during the week, but on Saturdays, the place is buzzing. The food is AMAZING!!!!!! The quality is top, the taste is delicious, delicious, delicious, the variety is great, the price is not cheap but totally worth it. There are some unique things to try here that you won't find elsewhere! The cakes are soooooo good too!Tip: Don't miss this taste extravaganza! You can buy bread, cheese, wine ........ to take home as well. Your taste buds will definitely have fun here! :)||July 2, 2014
David_Cull||50||Having lived in London for a short period of time, this was certainly one of my favourite places to visit any time I had the opportunity! The market has a wide variety of food items available for sampling and buying and the best thing about it is that it's all locally made. Trust me, anything you buy here you would not be disappointed with - from the huge brownies/cookie to cured meats and different cheese. I highly recommend this as a spot to visit - try something too!||July 1, 2014
Mumble_Swerve||50||Spent along time at Borough Market recently, eating and buying food. The chorizo burger was great, and the ostrich burger was intriguing. So much lovely food to choose from, but we bought cheese rolled in volcanic ash, truffle oil salami and hare pate.||July 1, 2014
Tony T||40||Haven’t been here for years (I used to live just down the road) and must say it’s really smartened up and expanded, it’s a fun place to stop off if you’re in Town but it’s less of a Market these days and more of a Tourist destination.||July 1, 2014
June K||50||So close to the Shard and our apartment, open from Thursday till Sunday. Every type of food you could want. The most amazing cheeses I have every seen and tried. From veggies to cooked food, to people selling their wares and sweets. It is all here. You can even have a Pimms while you shop and taste and decide......very civilised . Our apartment being close to here with a five minute stroll, we managed to have lots of beautiful food in our fridge to eat. LOVED, LOVED LOVED these markets. A must to see and experience.||June 30, 2014
Bev B||50||I expected Borough Market to be an old-fashioned fruit-and-veg market, so I was surprised to discover how "up-market" it is! Yes, there are some old-fashioned green market stalls, but it is so much more than that. I discovered the best bakeries in London, smoked salmon, real French and Dutch cheese stalls, chocolatiers - - and the pièce de résistance, the cheesecake stall which made me weak in the knees! I just had to have a piece of their New York cheesecake, which was every bit as delicious as it looked. There were many ethnic food stalls as well, which were clearly a popular place to find lunch. I will be making a bee-line for this market the next time I am in London!||June 30, 2014
Stephen H||50||What an absolute gem. The choice of food and produce is amazing. Fresh, exciting foods with a taste of wherever you want to be. The aromas themselves are intoxifying. Sensibly priced temptations that will suit all pockets. Stall holders and staff are keen, polite and enthusiastic about their wares. Do take time to visit.||June 30, 2014
Glen'n Barb D||50||This is a lovely market. Lots of lovely foods to buy, many places to get something to eat or drink. Lovely to just wander and look. There's never any pressure felt to make you buy. We bought some lovely cheeses in Neal's Yard, and some beautiful breads. Do go visit if you are in the area||June 30, 2014
Nayantara H||50||No amount of praises I sing for Borough Market will ever be enough. After reading about it on social media and TripAdvisor I knew I had to visit this market in London during my summer holiday last year. I had reserved the last weekend before I flew out to visit and it was a wise decision too, as I could buy a lot of things from here including fresh mushroom pates, pickles, cheeses and sausages for my family back in India. We reached the market fairly early in the morning and with an open mind, we were really not prepared for the awesomeness that awaited us. Right from fresh fruit and vegetables to cheeses, olive oils, pates, pickles, sauces, chocolates, sweets everything was available under one roof, all fresh, of the highest quality and very affordable. Most of the stall owners give you little samplers which tantalize and tempt your taste buds to try some more and buy a jar of their concoctions. Its not just street side fare mind you, you will find high quality cheeses, truffle mushrooms, oysters and exotic meats like ostrich, alligator etc here. There are also plenty of ready to eat food stalls ranging from the good ol'English to Spanish paellas, Indian samosas and thalis, Italian, sandwiches, burgers, pies, desserts. There is not much place to sit and eat but you can definitely grab your food packet and walk around while you munch and take in more of the market. There are also craftsmen who sell stone and ceramic ware, bags etc. Pantry items like pasta, sauces etc are also in plenty. They also have a lot of special events and cookouts with professional chefs demonstrating various recipes. You may need to look up their website before hand to be a part of these events. But completely worth it. I could spend hours at the borough market. This was one of the best experiences of my London agenda. If I go back to London again it would probably have to do with the tempting of this wonderful culinary journey right in the middle of London.||June 29, 2014
Kate M||50||Having walked from Trafalgar Square to the Shard and then on our way back west, we found this wonderful open market!! I was thrilled to find such an amazing variety of food and desserts - if I lived about, I would surely have bought the fresh produce/fish/vegetables, but being a tourist, I was only able to order what I could eat then and there. I settled on Ethiopan food and ordered everything I could - chicken, which came with rice, flatbread and a choice of 2 sides - I chose lentils and spinach - and I so enjoyed the flavors and spices. My husband, on the other hand, ordered a double sausage burger down the way, with what he thought would be "American" mustard, but soon found out was a spicy mustard he couldn't handle!! But I loved it!! I could have spent a few days there, choicing a different lunch or dinner each day, but sadly was limited to that day. I would go more often if I could!||June 28, 2014
Colleen D||40||If you don't find yourself carrying a multiple of bags/boxes of delicious treats after visiting this market, I worry for you. There are simply too many temptations here! From meats and cheeses, to brownies and pies, milkshakes, fish and chips, cheesecake, curries, pizza, . . . .the problem is not finding something to eat; it is how to choose among so many options. I got an absolutely heavenly brownie at the Cinnamon Tree Bakery and took two steps and decided I had to get a chocolate raspberry slice at a different bakery. If you plan to eat a meal at the market be forewarned that there is not an abundance of places to sit. We eventually made our way to the yard of the nearby church and found a patch of grass for an impromptu picnic. My daughter and I had fish and chips (we splurged and had the halibut which was very fresh and good) and my son had a pie and a milkshake and a piece of cheesecake, and also got a loaf of bread and hunk of cheese for later. He's 19 and taking full advantage of his metabolism! My husband had roast pork with crackling and my other daughter had a chicken burger. We also got some fresh fruit - raspberries and blueberries - to share. Many vendors will offer small samples of their products and everyone was friendly. There are also craftspeople selling their wares so you can get some unique gifts if you are in the mood to shop.||June 28, 2014
bszweda||40||It's mostly under cover so it's a good spot to duck into if the rains start. Right across from the tube station and near other attractions like The Shard. You can get some already cooked food here - it's not just raw things to buy like at a grocery. Coffee, tea, etc and sweets if you are just passing through are readily available as are more substantial lunches. I personally just like the feel and energy of markets even if I don't want to eat anything. This particular market, has all food (some flowers etc but mostly food). If food is not your thing there are plenty of other London markets that will make you happy. Signs also announce free WiFi.||June 28, 2014
sam-zk||50||This is one place my youngest daughter and I just love to go every time. It would not be unfair to say that this is arguably one of the best food markets in Europe. Seafood, meats, fruit, veg, cheeses, cakes, chutneys, coffee, preserves... you name it and you'll have it. Can't ever tire of this place. Go there often and it never fails to surprise with something new and exciting.||June 26, 2014
chrissycream||50||Went there on Friday around 930am and the shops aren't busy yet, except one cafe with a long line and everybody waiting for their morning boost. Lots of fresh produce and street food. Keep your stomach empty to sample the food this market has to offer, such as paella, fresh oysters, pastries, candies, cookies...so much yummy food. I also bought some berries and peaches and they were soooooo juicy. ||June 26, 2014
jimbosmiff||40||The quality and wide selection of foods makes this a foodie heaven and you can get stuff here you will struggle to find elsewhere.However, it is very touristy and also quite expensive.There are lots of "eateries" in and around the market.||June 26, 2014
Nanci I||50||We stumbled across this outdoor marketplace and had quite an eyeful! They had everything from fresh produce, to large vats of curry dishes. And the display of mushrooms! I had never seen such a variety of them in my life! Definitely a place to go check out and have lunch at!||June 26, 2014
baecc||40||Good food and colourful markets with loads of goodies from fruits & vegs, to roast pork and turkish delight. We tried some of these: Roast pork belly with apple sauce sandwich from Roast!, Fish and chips from Fish! takeaway (we also ate at the Fish!Kitchen), fresh oyster, fruit juice, great coffee from Monmorth. It was so good that we came to this market twice. It was very crowded during lunch hour, many office workers came here for lunch besides tourists. Each servings cost about 7 pounds so it is not cheap from 'street food' point of view.||June 25, 2014
MonaLisaCroydon||50||The fresh, eclectic array of produce draws me back to Borough Market time and time again...Authentic London with an abundance of Street Food and friendly vibes☺||June 25, 2014
monfong24||40||An interesting visit - with good food and fresh produce that tempts you along the way. Go for the paella, it was amazing!||June 25, 2014
Leintwardine||50||Borough market is a mecca for food and drink and represents the best of British.If your self catering in London then this place is a must as you have all the choice you need.You can sample most of the wine before purchasing and I would recommend the Lyme bay fruit wines and the V Gallery Marshmallow Vodka. We could not resist the cakes which were worth every calorie! Even if you don't purchase anything it's still a great experience and the atmosphere is buzzing.||June 25, 2014
Worldtosee2018||50||We stumbled across this whilst viewing The Shard - it's just down the street from the base of the Shard. We visited on a Saturday afternoon and it was booming with people. The fresh produce available was amazing, and made us quite jealous of the people who lived nearby who could take advantage of this market. We had never seen a lot of what was available, and particularly liked the bottled beers stall - best and most unusual selection ever!||June 25, 2014
pixieSG||50||Love it so much we visited twice during our trip to England.Many delicious street food. Our favourites : "Roast" sandwiches, "Fish" F&C takeaway, Paella, fresh oysters, organic ice cream, breads, Turkish Delights. Stalls open at around 11am local time. Be there early to avoid crowds.||June 24, 2014

KarenM1801||50||Friends took us here and we were fascinated by the variety of food, wine chocolate, bread and so many more amazing items from around the world. Well worth a visit next time you are in London||June 23, 2014
704suer||50||All the hustle and bustle of experiencing London A Saturday afternoon was a wonderful experience plenty of variety obviously very popular as it was packed a very sunny afternoon.Morris dancers, open air cooking, fine wines, everything you could want unless you peace and quiet||June 23, 2014
Richard S||50||Been going to Borough Market for years and it never dissapoints. A cool buzzing market selling some of the finest food and drink your likely to come acros.Love that you can grab a cold glass of wine or cider and enjoy it as you walk around the market. Great mix of people here and great places to eat both within the market and the surrounding restaurants and pubs. The street food is amazing from Thai curries to king prawn wraps or good old fish and chips. A real treasure. 5 stars. ||June 23, 2014
SWilsonD||50||I was there at 8.30 on Saturday morning when the market was less busy. It has a tremendous atmosphere and the stall holders were helpful and generous - you could easily get enough samples for a whole meal if you try hard enough!In anycase I had a wonderful game sausage baguette with builders tea at the market cafe. The staff were all bright faced and loud (in the best way) Londoners who got my day off the the best possible start.||June 23, 2014
Joe P||50||The smells, the colours, the sights and more importantly the taste experience. Stubbed on this market but well worth a visit.||June 22, 2014
DMCK63||50||We love Borough Market. The choice of food is excellent and the variety of stalls makes for interesting browsing.We ate curry walking around, had excellent wine in a lovely wine bar and bought chocolate in a Caribbean chocolate shop.What more could you ask for?||June 22, 2014
tuvistuvis||40||Enjoyed walking around this market looking for new food experiences. Went with my boyfriend, my brother and his girlfriend. She's vegan but had no problem finding something vegan to eat at this market. ||June 22, 2014
lianastropkov||50||We came to Borough Market for Saturday lunch on our city break in London. We loved the variety and new ideas. I am adventurous but some of the ideas we too far even for me, such as camel burger. Something for everyone.||June 22, 2014
islandmarsh||50||Made me truly want to move to London. All sorts of fresh vegetables, fruits, meats and seafood. PLUS all sorts of takeaway food, wines, cheeses, olive oil, sweets. I would recommend going early. We were there on a fine, sunny day and by 11:30 a.m., it was extremely crowded.||June 21, 2014
pinklove||10||I have no idea why people rate this place so high...I went today on a beautiful sunny saturday and I left feeling like WHY DID I EVEN GO??First of all, it is PACKED. Like sardines on a train..expect to be stood on and pushed around. I hardly saw any food ready to eat. It was a lot of cheese stalls and other random jams and stuff you put in your cupboard, not in your mouth for immediate consumption.And i was THIRSTY and there were no ice cold drinks. Just uncovered juices with no ice in them, I even sneezed into some by accident. Lol no my fault that no food or these drink juices dont have lids! So unhygienic! I wanted just a can of coke. It literally took me 40 mins to find one once we left the place. You cant walk into nandos or a pub and get one either, they only sell it to you if you SIT DOWN to eat.We ended up going for a duck wrap, it was 6 pounds each! Major rip off and once I bit into it it had a bone in it. Dont waste your time! Unless you like crowds, average food, no drink , NO TOILET and u love standing up near the sewers to eat.||June 21, 2014
384helenap||40||Nice to walk around, lovely cheeses, wine bar, local produce e t c. Well worth a visit. A little bit like travel back in time.||June 21, 2014
Red_V_Rover||50||There's loads of reviews below describing how good Borough Market is, and they are all correct. If you like good food, this is the place to visit, particularly as a tourist in London looking for something a little off the tourist trail The choice is incredible - there was pretty much every type of food and culture on display that you can think of, and. believe me, I think about food a lotWhen we went, it was a hot, sunny Saturday morning in June, so it was incredibly busy, but there is so much to see and get round, it really didn't feel like it was busy, until you stopped to queue somewhere. I ate far, far too much and spent a very uncomfortable afternoon trawling round museums, but, it was, frankly, worth every pound of weight I gained. You can't do it justice on a website or a piece of paper, so just go and enjoy it. You won't regret it||June 21, 2014
Deborah B||50||Not the first time I've visited Borough Market - each time back in London it is top on the list. The last trip there was absolutely brilliant. Perhaps because it was the quietest we have ever been there for but each stall looked amazing, well presented and mouth watering. Particularly the fruit and vegetables, fish, meat, cheese and bread stalls. Don't miss this place off your sightseeing in London.||June 20, 2014
EllaAO||50||This is a wonderful open-air market with an amazing variety of dishes and delicacies. If you are looking for lunch or a midday snack there are many types of food to chose from and the the cheese and meat vendors are amazing. Next time we visit, we'll be making this stop early on so we can stock the flat with yummy things to eat. If you are at all a foodie, this is a definite must see.||June 19, 2014
Antoanna888||50||We arrived from London Gatwick on a train just in front of Borough Market (London Bridge station) at lunch time so went straight forward to the Market to eat. It's a pity we always visit the Market with our luggage, I'd love to go there to pass more time wondering around hands free.We ate at the vegetarian burger place first, and then walked around a little. Ended up buying a huge meat sandwich and a salad later. It started to rain heavy after this, so we popped in the cacao heaven for some hot beverage and chocolate treats of course.And there are so many more places to go to and try!||June 19, 2014
Amy W||50||I have lived in London for four years and never tire of this wonderful market. Full of surprises and teeming with life, it never fails to entertain visitors from abroad. Make sure you go with an empty stomach as there is something on offer to please every taste. Be aware that Saturdays are especially crowded but even so, worth the struggle.||June 18, 2014
tzampirri||50||This was one of the highlights of my trip! It is truly a Foodie heaven. The market is full of sweets, savory foods, alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages as well as artisan wares. The place called Roast has the most amazing sandwiches. I also loved the little stall that sells Borough Market tea towels and oven mitts. I bought them for hostess gifts for friends back in the States. Don't miss this!||June 18, 2014
kdknight87||50||The food is fabulous! Too many options to try all the cheeses, breads, grilling meats, sweets, and more! We ate on the Thames just east of the market at an open air Mediterranean restaurant which was very good but when we continued down the river and found this gem, we all regretted our earlier meal a bit! Lunch here every day while in London!||June 18, 2014
Tantiko||40||Went on a weekday just before mid day and it wasn’t crowded at all, so it was easy to visit every store and google at the foodstuffs, although the atmospheric hustle and bustle of a lively market was not quite there. The market was smaller than I expected but there was a good variety of food including cheeses, artisan breads, fish, sandwiches, sausages, fruits, pies and even wheatgrass and truffles. Unfortunately, once you decide on something to eat, there are no seating areas within the market and the best option is to walk over to the grounds of the lovely cathedral next door. Definitely worth visiting.||June 18, 2014
Cdn_Traveller505||50||I always make a trip to the Borough Market when in London. It's a great place to get a fabulous lunch/brunch! You will find something here to suit any taste and it's all good! I really enjoy the German Sausage, my daughter loves the Indian cuisine, and my son gets a wild game burger everytime he goes. The hot Scrumpy Cider is a nice treat on a cold day as well. Take the time to wander around and you'll see everything from fresh fruits and veggies to tea, desserts, fresh meats, and wonderful cheeses. It's a cornucopia!||June 18, 2014
tuckers77||50||If you like people watching surrounded by some the best food the UK has to offer, this is the place for you! I've visited here on a few occasions and it is great fun - well worth a visit. Just be mindful that it is a captive market and isn't cheap, so if you start buying things you'll soon spend a fortune!||June 17, 2014
Barb W||50||The Borough Market in London is absolutely amazing! The setting: under the railway arches and Southwark Cathedral looming in the background. The vendors with the variety of foods are numerous: cheese,bread, meat, spices - the selections will take your breath away. The "Ginger Pig" butchers - first class products and a sausage roll to die for! You really could spend hours there, especially if you get something to eat either in the market or in one of the many pubs/cafes close proximity. Fabulous!||June 17, 2014
jsn888||50||We went there on a saturday and the place was alive with vendors of various kinds of foods. It was really hard to decide what to get because all the food looked and smelled good. It would be ideal to be able to come here a few times just to sample all the various foods available. A visit to london should include a stop here. ||June 17, 2014
jsgotravel||50||So much good and tasty food... Must try pork pie, duck sandwiches, meringue and many many more. Advise to visit during weekend, other days less stall operating||June 17, 2014
Binky_610||50||Though the area is becoming more gentrified every time I visit London, it is still one of my favorite places for food and to watch people. Try not to come during the busy lunch times however on Friday and Saturday because the crowds can be overwhelming. Go early before 11am.||June 17, 2014
4660neily||50||the place to go if you're a foodie... all kinds of food stalls, juices/smoothies, sweet treats too and amazing things to pick up and take home like deli cuts, fresh fruit and veg... even white pudding which i've never seen outside of the north-east of scotland! a really nice way to spend your day looking around and sample treats. worth a visit even during the week when the full market isn't there; still so much to try. i come every time i'm in london!||June 17, 2014
Suewood13||50||If you can name it you will find it here. There is such a cosmopolitan atmosphere and the food is just out of this world. Go with an appetite cos you will certainly need it||June 17, 2014
xIshidax||50||Since I first went I have repeated at least one day. The main idea is to walk around all the shops where you will be able to see a huge variety of food and delicatessen.I have no favorite spot as try to change every time I go. Highly recommend any homemade burger place and cheesecake as dessert.There is this one shop I like a lot, is more or less in the center of the market and it has many many cheese.||June 17, 2014
cngjr||50||This place is literally a feast given the great variety of stalls selling all sorts of tasty food. Even if you've just had a meal and are full, it's feast for the eyes as well so don't worry. Just wandering around and admiring the goods and produce on sale is great fun - and when you're hungry enough, feel free to sample the delicacies before choosing your favorite and getting some! Do pay a visit to this place when you're around. It's next to the london bridge/the river Thames so once you're done you can go for a walk across the bridge/along the bank.||June 15, 2014
sherif_farah||30||By co incidence we found our selves at Borough market. If you like to cook your meals during visiting London this would be a good place to purchase meat and fish.Smells from fast food area mads us feel with hunger. they are serving sandwiches like sated meat , Falafel noodles and chines food ,We have taken Falafel raps sandwiches which were fresh tasted very delecious||June 15, 2014
SerenaLiLola||50||It genuinely exceeded my expectations. Of course there were the things you expect at a market fresh fruit and vegetables but also have such a diverse and specialised range of foods from every corner of the globe. Most stalls will offer you a free sample of what they are selling. I was spoiled for choice with everything that was on offer. I only wished I lived in London to indulge in this gorgeous market weekly. If I had to pick a favourite from the whole trip it was definitely the home made sangria, located at the front entrance of the market.||June 15, 2014
JAM058||50||1st time here and oh how I wish I worked or lived near by- I'd be here all the time!!! Great atmosphere of folk who are really proud of their produce- be it the delicious Pie Minister or the only cheese maker in London. If you love food markets this is the place to come in London.||June 15, 2014
C_Don_13||40||We passed there when we were started the first tour, we didn't know, however was a very good experience, we could take a coffee (unfortunately wasn't our taste) however the others things that we ate were very nice, I recommend to pass there and see a typical market in London.||June 15, 2014
O2738MJmichaelt||40||We ventured here after looking around the shard next door. A busy market with a lively atmosphere catering mostly for tourists. An interesting array of British produce with lots of foreign (most Italian) scattered in amongst. Its a bit pricey but I guess everything in London is. The have good toilet facilities which is always a bonus.||June 15, 2014
Vazbo||50||My husband and I always come here every time we are in London. An undercover market, lots of fresh produce, meats, fish, vegetables, hams, cheeses, fruit, cakes, breads, you name it, it's here!! All the very best of quality as well. Most stalls have free tasters and that's an experience in itself. Yummy!! A great place to come for lunch as lots of stalls from around the world selling fabulous street food - fish & chips, falafel, steak rolls, pies n gravy, Chinese, Indian, tapas, rock oysters, there's certainly something for everyone. I recommend the duck wraps and paella. The fish and chips were also the best I'd had anywhere in London. Everything is so fresh you can't fail to be impressed and full up!The fruit stall we found amazing. We must have got about 1000 cherries for £4, amazing value and flavour. It's a must coming here. Get off at London Bridge tube station rather than Borough Market as it's closer. ||June 14, 2014
Eugene L||40||Was able to visit the market for an hour or two. In addition to fresh produce (of which some shops specialise in particular ethnic foods such as Croatian, Ethiopian, Spanish, etc.), a large part of the market is also devoted to fantastic street food from all corners of the world. If you have the time, it is also recommended to visit a line of wine shops along the street adjacent to the market - a fairly wide selection is available for tasting.||June 13, 2014
isobelb792||50||Love visiting this market to buy food for lunch. You can picnic on the river or in the yard of Soutwark Cathedral. Visited on a Friday and it was very busy has a lovely vegetarian pie (mushrooms) with veggie gravy and mash. Lovely macroons too. Well worrh a visit at lunch time if you are in the area.||June 12, 2014
DougieFowler||50||We stopped in Borough Market to buy food and I was taken by the variety of stalls with colourful produce on offer.A great exoerience.||June 11, 2014
ShootingGirl||40||We got there 3ish on a Saturday afternoon and the market was still bustling. Found some fabulous mushroom pate, cheese, wine, and bread for picnic dinners. It's similar to the open air market in Barcelona. If I wasn't so jet lagged, would have loved to taste the local beers!||June 11, 2014
nadia089||50||We visited on a busy Saturday morning so we expected it to be bustling and we were right, but even so we had a great time, plenty food to choose from , to be honest by the time we had tried all the freebies on offer we were well on our way to being full!! But we did buy fresh veg and fruit which was good value for money.All round the area there was plenty of entertainment going on , lots catering for young children , plenty of stalls selling unusual things to buy, if you just want to sit and watch the world go by then that's ok too , find a seat and just relax, all in all it was a fun dayI think the fact it was warm and sunny did help to make it memorable but I imagine even on a dull day a good time will be had||June 9, 2014
Bob C||40||Heaving with people on a Saturday. Great choice of takeaway food.An experience not to be missed but perhaps once only unless you are a real foody||June 8, 2014
JessNC||50||Cheese? Yes. Stout? Yes. Prosciutto? Yes. Can I get one that is 100% acorn fed? Yes. Pork pie? Of course. Can I get one of thise with pickle in? Yes. Doughnut with custard cream? Yes. Olives? Every kind imaginable. Fish and chips? Fresh and hot. Thai curry? By the vat. So good. Just...so good.||June 8, 2014
joerushton||40||A morning walk around the market with the children was a great start to the day. Lots of different market stalls offering fresh and varied products from around the country. Food stalls from Vietnamese, Indian through to coffee and croissants. Easy to get to from London Bridge station and great views of the Shard!||June 8, 2014
MichelleYHLiew||50||A feast for epicurean and foodies. Great selection of cheeses, game meat, sausages, ham, fresh produce, fruits, olive oil, vinegars, seafood, etc. Quite an experience. ||June 7, 2014
sandraf516||50||What a fantastic place to visit if you get the chance while in London, 5 minutes from London Bridge tube station. The variety of market stalls together with street food gives you such a variety of food, fruit and veg, it will make your head ache trying to decide what to eat.||June 7, 2014
RUSS1602||50||My wife and I visited here on Saturday, which was a beautiful bright day.We arrived here from the London Eye by taxi, but there's two tube stations nearby - Borough and London Bridge.The Borough Market is easy to find off the main street by the Thames.It's an undercover market under a railway bridge and is uniquely set - which gives it an old fashioned feel.However, everything sold here is top class. There fresh fruit, bread, pastries of many different types - some of which I have never seen or tasted. Some give out tasting plates.You can find a garlic stall here with 15 different varieties - spices from all over the world. Lots of seasonal vegetables. Olive oil in varying grades and sizes to take away.My favourite area was the freshly cooked stalls offering an amazing array of world wide platters ready to eat - some hot, some cold. Therefore, be prepared to eat and buy food here for your larder and fridge.All of it looks well managed, clean and is priced correctly.Take some time to look around the market in the side streets where you will find other shops to suit most tastes. Plenty of places to grab a coffee or tea and have a sit down.Well worth a visit and I would return. People here were very pleasant.Expect to stay over an hour in this area of the south bank.Thank you to the community of Borough Market - it is obvious you work very hard to provide a good source of products and friendly service!||June 7, 2014
Triciaukus||50||This was my first time at Borough Market, and what a treat! The great selection and variety of fruits, vegetables, cheese, meats - what a sight to behold. Then, team that up with the stalls selling a wonderful variety of prepared food for eating. What a great combination and a lovely way to pass the day. For me, the only thing missing would have been some good music, but oh well...I got there by tube, getting off at the the London Bridge stop on the Jubilee line. This stop is right outside the market, so very handy. The day I was there was a beautiful, sunny day, but this event is also a great one to consider in inclement weather, as the market is fully covered, with tall overhead roofing to protect you from the elements. Note that the selections include some very nice grades of choices, noting the truffle stall, and the mushroom pate stall, the wide selection of cheeses and special meats, as examples. Excellent!||June 6, 2014
OwenS465||50||We passed these markets on the way to the London Bridge and it was definitely worth the stop over. All the stalls are fully of friendly people with even better food.||June 5, 2014
Emma V||40||Borough Market is a bit of an institution. Lively and bustling during the day you can buy all manner of tasty foods and drinks here. There's something to suit everyone's tastes. In the evening most market stalls close but there are still tasty snacks and food to be had as some stalls stay open to serve hot food through the evening. This is very popular with those visiting the pubs around the market which are always buzzing with people spilling out into the streets to enjoy a beer with friends. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area night or day. ||June 5, 2014
lisawZ6160WY||50||We had a few hours to spare before lunch in the oxo tower and went around 10.30 on a weds , the market wasn't too busy and we could stroll around taking the sights and smells in .. Amazing food , fresh and looking fabulous , we were eating at 1 so didn't try any food but there were mouthwatering food to be had so go if you are hungry really great atmosphere will go again but on an empty stomach and will try lots of different foods ||June 5, 2014
tuna13||50||Whenever I visit London I try to go there on a saturday morning. You can buy from various types of bread and cheese and make yourself a great sandwich, take a coffee and eat by the Thames. If you had your breakfast buy a falafel and then a gelato from Neil's Yard. If you love fruits you will have hard time to choose among the vendors and fruits:) even just to walk and watch the stalls worths visiting.||June 4, 2014
sfchang||50||I love going to the Borough Market. So many food to sample and buy, so little stomach space. Yum!You can get fresh produce and artisan food. Beet of all is that they let you sample most of the produce without giving you funny looks. I love the cured meat, cheese, oil, freshly cooked scallops, paella, burgers, watermelon juice, freshly cooked truffle ravioli, and so much more.||June 4, 2014
BalCG||40||I loved it! Full of different options of food, from vegetable to chocolates, and a lot of ethnic stands. Go in the morning before it gets too crowed.||June 4, 2014
an1101||40||Staying in a hostel around the area and thought I would drop by for some food and it sure did not disappoint. Tried the pie with mash & gravy for £5.50 and it was a good enough meal to last me till dinner and it tasted heavenly... There were many more options that will not disappoint. Lots of freshly baked bread and pastries for sale as well as a variety of food from beef burgers to Indian cuisine to Japanese cuisine to fish & chips. You will definitely be able to find something that will suit your taste. ||June 3, 2014
paigesss||50||I work just across the river and go nearly every Friday. I always take people who visit and they are never disappointed. Best to go on a Friday or Saturday as there is more selection and better to go earlier, say 10 or 11 before it gets really crowded. Borough olives do the best red pesto I have ever tasted along with some amazing fresh Italian olives, there is a fruit stall near the micro herbs and vegetarian street food run by an older couple with the best British strawberries, raspberries, nectarines and cherries and they are really reasonably priced. So many great oils, breads and cheeses you can easily spend a fortune so be careful! but I've found it to be a really friendly market with some great stuff to buy. worth putting up with the crowds!||June 3, 2014
Judith A||10||We had been looking forward to visiting Borough Market for a long time. We went on Bank Holiday Monday...it was closed! Very disappointed!||June 2, 2014
sandy12||40||Had a very good time looking at food. We bought some sausage and cheese. It was very crowded and hard to get where you wanted and lines for food items. Open Thursday to Saturday. Go have fun.||June 2, 2014
LivninCA||40||A lively and colorful market for picking up interesting foods/goods from around the UK. Stalls full of different foods, drinks, veggies, meats, cheeses, fruits and plants. Lots (LOTS) of people on the weekends milling about, so you might choose to go on a quieter week day, but not all of the stalls are open on the quieter days.||June 2, 2014
Trappy666||40||Borough Market is a must of any foodie that visits London. The range of sweet things, beers, oils, ciders and everything in between that is on offer is second to none! I stopped by ScotchTails who do the best Scotch Eggs and Sweet Potato chips that I have ever had. There are also many other vendors and the choice is too much for someone that enjoys good quality food.||June 2, 2014
plumcox||40||A busy Saturday lunchtime when we went, but with terrific food on sale it was well worth a slight jostle!Every member of the family got to choose just what they wanted for 'right now' - wurst in rolls, falafel wraps, chocolate brownies, flaxjacks, mini biscuits, doughnut shaped peaches, blue berries - so lunch 'on the move' was a dream. The food wasn't terribly cheap, but the portions were good and so was the quality.We stocked up on cheese and fruit for later, very pleased with our purchases.Glorious to wander around, even if you aren't planning on buying anything, as the stalls are set up in a very attractive fashion.A stroll along the river, finishing your food and licking your fingers, rounds this trip off nicely.||June 1, 2014
SKLC194||50||Superb market, so much choice, fresh, smoked, fried, grilled. Nice blend of cultures, smells and people. Will always visit this place when I am bck in London eating at one stall at a time||June 1, 2014
Sushmash||50||I loved the energy of the place , excellent choices in food . Home made cakes , cheese ,wine etc . We had food at Gujarati Rasoi which seemed the most popular choice . It was delicious food . I would recommend going there for the experience of it and excellent variety of food with Turkish coffee and delights . Added attraction wifi free . ||June 1, 2014
SomersetLaubo||40||A fab market for picking up interesting foods from around the Uk and the world. Lots of stalls to buy street food as well.||May 31, 2014
851sb||50||Had a great time strolling through the markets. Amazing displays of food and excellent cheese vendors. Chicken wrap place has an excellent chicken wrap. ||May 31, 2014
Murph6631||40||Food, food, food. If your looking for food from all the corners of the world then this is the place to go. We went on a Saturday and as others have said it does get very crowded, however get there early ie for breakfast you will have time to look around the stalls without having to fight your way to the free tasters. We did stay for lunch which after breakfast and tasters was maybe one step to far but well worth the belly busting pain. Would I go again? Yes, but not if I was dieting.||May 31, 2014
violetsnpansies||50||Borough Market was perfect for two hungry travelers. We had a terrific lunch - I had raclette and my mother had corned beef on a bagel. The number of cheesemongers was impressive, along with any other foodstuff you could imagine. I loved the hustle and bustle of the place. What a great outdoor market.||May 30, 2014
Jimbob44||50||My wife and I went to see what the market is all about. The food offerings are as varied and delicious as all of the write ups say that it is. Normally my wife refuses to eat street food but she was captivated by the freshness and variety of the food. She had a salted beef and pickle sandwich (shredded corned beef) and a fresh baked pastry from two different stalls while I had the Vietnamese chicken and then a cup of delicious goat milks ice cream. The only drawbacks are the packed crowds and no where to sit down to eat. Our food did not make it as far as the grounds of Southwark Cathederal since we ate it so fast. The fresh vegetables were beautiful and the vendors were very knowlegable about the food they were selling.||May 30, 2014
SFL360||50||Brilliant food all round. Sweeter, juicer, plumper and tastier than most around. Great variety, great fresh foods, great groceries. We are addicted!||May 30, 2014
woodditton1||50||Took my 14 and 11 year old here & they loved it! I am a foodie so it was great for me! We came early and had pastries for breakfast as well as lots of browsing. Came back for lunch at 2:00 and it was really busy. The stall holders were all very friendly & knowledgeable. Everything we ate was delicious!! Will definitely come again!||May 29, 2014
Makkiego||50||Great market with lots of different choices.Loved the cider, cheeses and the cold meet.Vibrant and interesting place to visit ||May 28, 2014
Julie W||50||It's a great place to wander and try different foods/drinks. Interesting array of different fruit and veg too. Great atmosphere and an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.||May 28, 2014
WendyFisher69||50||We visited here in the middle of a huge thunderstorm and what a way to spend time out of the storm!! Loads of stalls selling delicious food and lots of opportunity to try different things. Would definitely recommend a visit.||May 28, 2014
mgtdgirl||40||We had so much fun. So many good food choices, tough to decide. We never had raw scallops before. They were delicious.||May 28, 2014
Lynda009||50||We visited this market by chance as it was very near our hotel. I am so pleased we did it was fantastic.The market had a real buzz about it and sold vegetables of every kind, cheeses, breads, wines, meats, fish. The vegetables and fruit looked fantastic, there were so many different kinds and so cheap. I would shop here all the time if I lived in London, forget your supermarkets.We bought some breads and cakes to bring home with us and it was such a shame we could not carry anymore on the train.Its certainly worth a visit if you have the time.||May 28, 2014
TonyV2012||50||The range and quality here was superb with the highlight for me being the Chilli shop. Amazing range of chillis and some rarely available ones too. Perfect morning with the choice of meats and cheeses thrown in as well as some excellent food stalls serving up delicious meals.||May 28, 2014
dorisdobin||50||Whenever you're in London this has to be a Must Go! Such a variety of foods and most of the stalls are happy to sample their goods! Yum ! The fish hall is something again. If you have a love of food you won't be upset ! Enjoy....||May 28, 2014
Jewellsverne||50||This is a great day out...so many lovely and unusual foods to try from all over the world, outstanding collections of vegetables, meat, fish, olives, curries, herbs and spices, bread, pulses ...need I go on - if you come to London and want to see brilliantly displayed fresh food then come here you will not be disapointed!||May 28, 2014
mik-and||40||On a day trip to London by train we hopped one stop from Waterloo to London Bridge and visited the market. Not too busy at 9am, so ordered a bacon and bubble roll with a cup of splosh from Maria's cafe. Just a great day to start a tour of SE London.Come back later and buy the specialist foods to take home!||May 27, 2014
mike e||50||This market is rather famous and you may know it somewhat or very well already, but here are my thoughts from our mid May visit, first it is the best food market in London. Secondly, the quality and variety of the edibles is high and priced right to boot. Something not to be missed is Pate Moi(an organic mushroom pate) This light earthy miracle is too good to merely sample and walk on. Then there is Cannon and Cannon, makers of fine dried sausages, and they are fine indeed. Lets also mention Cumbrian Specialty Meats, where you will find wonderful Scotch eggs and the best game sausages on a stick ever. Now, equally impressive is Sweet Roots licorice(foam banana/monkeys) which sells proper licorices. Borough Nuts sells interestingly tasty chocolate macadamia nuts rolled in spice (cinnamon I think). You will want to sample a cider drawn from oak barrels , a medium dry on the potent side was my delight, have a few, they are great and priced right. You should find this kind cider seller easily along the main drag. I forgot the purveyor name, sorry. Oh, I nearly forgot, Pie Minister is just wonderful, and they set up just in front of Southwark Cathedral on the edge of the market. There is a cool area to eat beside the Cathedral, and a Pie Minister pie makes a fine edible when admiring the gothic stonework. The best times for the market are Thursday ,Friday, and Saturday. Show up and eat, drink and be merry.||May 27, 2014
szlaw10||50||Wonderful not to be missed market. Unique foods, very diversified, cool atmosphere. A must see. I never miss it when I am in london and nither should you? ||May 27, 2014
cookielumps||50||This market is fantastic. There is every food you can think of for you to try. Beautiful cheeses, bread and meats. The take away stalls are just so tempting and so much choice. We ended up with a box of Indian Curry ( Thali) and a slice if cheesecake each. Don't miss this gem of a market.||May 27, 2014
gnancy2011||50||The Borough Market is right at London Bridge near The Shard. It has a history dating back to about the 11th century. If you love food, it is just a fun place to be. My husband and I roamed around happily taking in all the sights, sounds, and smells. Ordinarily, neither one of us is wild about crowds, but, somehow, the crowds added to the atmosphere here. I took photo after photo of colorful fruits and vegetables, breads piled high, yummy cheeses, etc. I had the most marvelous toasted cheese sandwich at the Kappacasein Dairy stall! Make sure you check the days and hours for the market. I believe the full market is not open until Thursday. It would be a shame to get there and not be able to experience the full market.||May 26, 2014
Lizzie_34759||50||I used to think that if you've been to one market you've been to them all, but I was pleasantly surprised. Get off the Tube at London Bridge and there it is follow the signage to the market. Doesn’t look all that from outside, but once you go under the arch it is not like your everyday local market. Samples, don't be shy, most of the stalls will give you a taste and of course you sample and you are hooked. They have everything from regular fruit and vegetables to exotic varieties. Meat and fish regular and exotic. Then the breads, cakes, chocolate, cheeses, olive stands and alcohol stands, so many to choose from. The spice stall is my favourite not only do they have everything you can imagine in sensible sizes and reasonable prices, the sales staff are very knowledgeable and will answer most questions you have about the spices and condiments they sell, including usage storage and unique uses.Worth the trip I’d say, but remember to take a shopping trolley or at least a decent sized cool bag for all the goodies you are going to buy. Allow a good for a couple of hours for wondering around then actually buying produce.You can also buy tea and coffee and patries to consume on site, local restaurants are very near by as well.On a pleasently shocking note they have VERY CLEAN TOILETS if you get caught short.||May 26, 2014
Eleanor C||50||Two choices - eat a big meal before you visit the Borough Market (Thurs-Sat) or visit on a completely empty stomach! The food in this giant, heaving market is a thrilling assault on the senses! At lunch it is thronged with people buying and eating 'on the hoof', or enjoying their choices in the grounds of nearby Southwark Cathedral. Recommend arriving early and enjoying breakfast in Fish with it's glass walls while watching the market come to life. Not to be missed.||May 25, 2014
Peaches O||50||If you're looking for fresh cheeses – raw and pasteurised – from France and Switzerland, go here! They also have an array of conserves and charcuteries.I have patronised their stall in Borough Market for over 3 years noshing on their raw goat cheeses and my favourites are: Le Palais Frais: a soft white raw goat cheese with a mild flavour. Good in salads, spread on toast, crackers or oat cakes. Caprinelle: a semi-hard raw goat cheese which is deliciously nutty in favour or with a hint of a acidity if still young.Tomme de Brebis: A hard raw goat cheese with a rich nutty flavour. Good eaten on its own/with a suitable wine accompaniment or in sandwiches.In my opinion the prices are commensurate to the high quality and should be seen from this perspective.||May 25, 2014
alamo07109||40||great atmosphere.. fresh produce, cheese vendors, meats, bakeries.. lots of places to eat and see. well worth the visit.||May 25, 2014
NurseVx||50||A must for anyone who enjoys food, follow your nose which will be exercised to its limits with the most delicious smells, samples can be had at lots of stalls. Hardest thing will be what and where to eat. ||May 24, 2014
Paul W||50||Every time you turn a corner you can't help but say, wow look at that, lots of tasters to be had resulting in just having to buy some. The street food stalls are very tempting as they all look so good. A real must if your a foodie.||May 23, 2014
Rob A||40||This market is only open Thursday-Saturday so make sure you put it on your planner for one of those days. This is a great place to shop for all kinds of things, especially fresh food. We got an amazing grilled cheese sandwich from one of the vendors on the recommendation of a friend but there is all kinds of variety available. I was tempted by the raclette (potato with cheese topping) just around the corner.||May 23, 2014
gcsj||50||Had just read about it in travel article before my visit to London, and what a surprise.It is a fabulous food market and if you like trying different foods, or just interested in sampling different foods it is definitely worth a visit.It was a lovely sunny day,very busy but a great party like buzz and you do manage to get some place to sit and enjoy the food.The area around the market is full of history and don't miss Southwark Cathedral.||May 22, 2014
John E||50||If you want some fantastic hot or cold food whilst in London at very reasonable prices try Borough Market. The range of food is excellent, prices very reasonable and the food is delicious.||May 22, 2014
Sparky2511||50||The smell alone from the food stalls would entice you in here, street food at its best, everything from Asian to Burger. The selection of food stalls is amazing and the choice of fresh vegetables, fruits, cheese, teas, etc. is amazing. A must on any trip to London. ||May 22, 2014
barbarastaines||40||We started off at Waterloo station and walked along the Souhbank taking in the sights.Borough market was interesting and a little crowded. I enjoyed looking at the stalls and drinking proseco in the sunshine.||May 20, 2014
marcogi6||50||Not to be missedExcellent food marketVery crowded on SaturdaysBars and restaurant arounf the market||May 20, 2014
lordsajan||40||Apart from its contribution to history it is a very lively market with a variety of things to choose from. You will find more tourist than the regular shopper. Good place to have a quick snack. Pretty crowded during lunch on weekdays and Saturdays. Good variety of sweets from different parts of the world, make sure what it is made of to avoid disappointments. A quick gulp of chilled beer from market porter pub situated opposite would complete the visit appropriately.||May 19, 2014
VivaUnivers||50||definitely not to be missed, there's such a great variety of fresh and delicious food. After eating, walk around and go to the riverside! I have not found other markets like this in any other city.||May 19, 2014
RosannevH||50||Really good spot to get some fresh food for eating right away or take away. Good atmosphere with people sitting around in little groups and always busy but a lot to see and a lot of choice for something to eat. I definitely recommend all the cakes/desserts! ||May 19, 2014
Chris M||50||Fun atmosphere. Strange food offerings. Wild boar sausages, goats milk ice cream (with chili), curries, fresh juices, cockles, oysters, cheeses, a taste of Spain.....Always try to pay a visit when I am in town.||May 18, 2014
robert b||50||What an amazing place, vibrant, full of charm and the most amazing selection of food stalls, loved it.||May 18, 2014
Angela T||50||Busy bustling market, lots of lovely unique foods to taste. Plenty of drinks and tables to sit and eat at available. A good selection of quality foods to buy. Great atmosphere.||May 18, 2014
alittlefallofrain||50||Unfortunately we visited on a day when most shops and stalls were closed but still had a ball browsing all the ones that were open. I can only imagine the foodie wonderland this place becomes when everything is open. It's a great place to go for lunch/street food of every cuisine and to try new things. There is a turkish delight stall there that sells every flavour of turkish delight you might ever hope to try, spice shops with hundreds of variations of spices, I could go on and on. Definitely worth visiting!||May 17, 2014
Marisa-Robert||50||We visited on a Thursday afternoon. There where lots of stalls with different kinds of bread, cheese, meat, fish, juices, veg and fruits and then there were the sweets, cakes and pastries all under one roof. We tried the onion and tomato bread which was delicious and very fulfilling, the home made juices were also delicious. The pastries were lovely and very good. We really enjoyed it, its a very good place to eat very good quality food. Definetely recommended.||May 17, 2014
Jim S||50||I stepped off of the Underground and there it was. I had not heard about it but apparently there are several markets around the city worth checking out.Located in an old market building, there are a wide selection of shops, food and produce stands. This is a great place to stop for breakfast or lunch or perhaps to pick up supplies for a snack later.||May 17, 2014
Valentina_Lab||50||Borough market is one of my all time favourite places in London. Wonderful food from every corner of the world, and super friendly staff at every stall! Try the coconut pancakes! And the pig on the spit sandwich! And if you're a spices fan, you have to have a look at the Spice Mountain stall! Friendly staff will guide you through the flavours of the world and recommend spices for you! Try their Dukkah and their Sumac, absolutely delicious!I always make a point of going for lunch to Borough when I'm in London, you just shouldn't miss it for anything in the world.||May 17, 2014
Ploytatt||50||We stayed in the London Bridge Hotel just across the street and we didn't have breakfast included in our room price. It turned out to be perfect since we could just cross the street and get something to eat from the market. I had a really good mash & pie for breakfast and walked around to buy a smoothie. There are vendors selling breads, cured meat, burgers, cheeses. Loved the place!||May 16, 2014
moabmeadow||50||We went on a Saturday so it was particularly busy and very festive. You could spend the day eating your way through the market. The food presentation is beautiful; the selection enormous. The produce and fruits are of the highest quality and are tightly controlled by independent food quality experts. We had a cheese sandwich (sounds pretty plain, doesn't it?) that was to die for. It had four types of cheese, red onion and leeks on homemade bread. The vendor indicated he went through four tons of cheese a week and by the length of the queue, I'm sure he was telling the truth. Worth the wait.||May 15, 2014
TrippinThom||50||This market is one of the nicest I have ever visited. Beautiful location, short walk from London Bridge tube station, next to an old church. Lovely market stalls, beautiful products, nice atmosphere, busy on peak hours. Must do attraction!||May 14, 2014
klkh2002||40||what can i say - I loved it! The Borough markets is a collection of really interesting and wonderful produce stores selling everything from seafood to premium cheeses and chacuterie. Much of the produce is really premium produce.||May 14, 2014
heyjudej||50||Eating in London can be an expensive and generally disappointing experience for Americans. The best meal I had on my last trip (Nov 2013) came from the Borough Market. There's a stand that sells BBQ pork sandwiches -- I can't remember the name, but you can locate it by the very long line (que) and the delicious smell. Ate one of those for lunch and then picked from the many delicious choice to make our own "picnic" dinner to take back to the hotel. When you enter from the Southwark Cathedral side, it starts out with tented vendors and then it moves inside to a larger covered area and finally to an indoor artisan market with high end and high quality meats, cheeses, produce, breads, drinks, desserts -- pretty much anything you can think of! I can't imagine how much I would spend shopping there if I lived in London. It is crowded, but in a fun way. Highly recommend a visit!||May 14, 2014
RichardC954||50||If you want to spend a couple of hours looking at fresh produce of all kinds then this is the place for you. It becomes extremely busy but the stalls offer a whole range of fresh produce from around the world, and the quality is second to none. Vegetables, cheeses, wines, meats the list goes on. Make sure you have a strong shopping bag with you. Whilst there book ahead at 'Roast' for lunch - the restaurant in the centre of the market. Superb!||May 13, 2014
Tami K||50||We were told we simply HAVE to visit the Bourough market while in London and we weren't surprised why they told us too!Loved it!!! Fresh produce from all over UK and delicious things to buy, snack on and eat!Go HUNGRY!!!!!||May 9, 2014
Epicureously||50||first thing to say that this is an artisan food market. Don't bother going if youre looking for a bargain. Its a really good place to get your taste buds going. Yes it gets packed on a saturday in the summer with tourists. So what. I know some of the stall owners and this is the pasion and ole income. I disagree with some of the tradional market people who call it pretentous. It's really creative and brings a lot of people into the SE1 community. Go early or on a thursday and you will be able to explore more.||May 7, 2014
Tony N||50||Experience the world in a meal. Great enviroment, great music, great people and sticky moments with great service.||May 7, 2014
Martinzz||50||Go hungry and shop around before you decide on what you will have. The choice is plentiful and quality is outstanding. Definitely a place to be visited repeatedly, as there are many hidden treasures and your first visit fills you up very quickly. Avoid Saturdays though, as the place gets repleted by tourists.||May 7, 2014
poonam07||40||I went last year this place is a nice day out. You can graze on different foods and have a wonder. Good opportunity to try new and different foods including various cheeses, meets, breads, pastries. I tried oysters for a pound not my thing but a experience.||May 7, 2014
willsayer||50||A great way to spend a morning or afternoon – it’s a foodie paradise – or fooradise if you will! The breadth of choice on offer is amazing and you just want to try bits of everything! There are lots of place to buy food to eat there and also to take away. We stopped for a take-away Sangria, an ice-cream then we had a glass of wine outside Brindisa as you exit the market and head onto the high street. We also bought cheese and cold meats to take away. Looking forward to going back to eat a lunch there – the fish and chips looked fantastic outside the seafood restaurant.||May 7, 2014
Tereesha||50||Go early before the crowds and just feast your eyes on all the great stalls, exceptional bread and pastries, meats, fish, you name it , it is there. If you are lucky to live local, what a great place to do your shopping. Will be back with a very big bag!!||May 6, 2014
Melimel24||50||Thoroughly enjoyed exploring everything on offer at this fantastic market, which is close to London Bridge.The variety of produce on offer is immense, from delicious hot & cold foods including: Indian, Greek, deli specialty foods from Italy, vegetarian food served on a cabbage leaf, meats, including South African Biltong, Camel, Crocodile, Elk, Kangaroo, Ostrich, Springbok & Zebra, cheese, bread, cakes, meringues, cookies/biscuits, nuts, oils, including truffle oils, mustard, sauces & jellies, pickle & chutneys, (the company 'Rubies in the Rubble' is especially worth a mention as they sell homemade chutneys sourced from unsold fruit & vegetables), as well as the usual fresh fruit & vegetables a typical market would sell. There was also ceramics & other crafts on sale. The atmosphere was both friendly & welcoming. I shall really look forward to returning there on our next trip to London.||May 6, 2014
Blue462||50||I wish I could visit this market every weekend. So much food and drinks, it was sensory overload and I loved every second of it. I just walked around for a long time with a Pimm's cup, sampling cheese and other goods. It was a wonderful time and the energy in the market it incredible.Just a tip for American travelers: You can bring back cheese, not meat, even if it is cured and vacuum sealed as we sadly learned returning to the US through customs.||May 5, 2014
BlueGunnerGirl||40||Visited Borough Market after a food walking tour. Was overawed by the cheeses, meats, pates, vinegars and oils available and had some wonderful tastings of some of the wares available. Great selection & knowledgable stall holders but it was incredibly crowded and this made it very difficult to negotiate the stalls in a logical fashion. Would definitely go again.||May 5, 2014
ScrummyMummy33||50||We came upon Borough Market after coming out of London Bridge tube, en route to our fabulous hotel (citizenM). We dumped our bags at the hotel and headed back here. What can I say? The food on all the stalls were fabulous- and unique. Great smells throughout each twist and turn of this great place. Be warned though- we went on a Saturday at 11am- by 1pm it was totally jammed (I'd advise not taking pushchairs as it's so busy). We had a Pimms whilst meandering around the stalls- trying cheeses from the Drunken Cheese as well as breads from the most delightful stalls. This market is totally worth a visit- you won't be disappointed!||May 5, 2014
Pihlajtr||50||Loved the different vendors, foods, smells, people. Purchased a breakfast sandwich - delicious. Surprised that we were able to purchase mimosa's and drink them there. Just wish we had markets like this at home - would have loved to purchase fresh food and pastries but I wouldn't be allowed to bring them back home to Canada.||May 4, 2014
John B||50||Being a die hard Yorkshire man I don't do London. Borough Market made me change my mind. What a great little place just 2 minutes from London bridge. My wife wanted to visit as she used to work very close but never visited! She was gutted about this! The food stalls were great with a fantastic choice of all cuisines at reasonable prices. There is a real life about the place. If we did not have the children we would have spent all day there between old pubs and great little food stalls! Neals Yard cheese shop is a must visit. Will defiantly go there again We called to Borough market before we visited the Shard which is only a block away from this place.||May 4, 2014
BeerBackwash||50||I loved this place! Not too big, not too small, easy to navigate. Produce was very nice and inexpensive, I wish they had more wild mushroom offerings. Fresh proteins and charcuterie were abundant, as were cheeses/dairy and bakery goods. Lots of sweets (the fudge and ice-creams are amazing!). I ate a grilled cheese sandwich at one of the food stalls that was loaded with emmenthaler, gruyere, comte, and melted leeks and shallots....That sandwich was worth the trip alone!!!Yea, yea....I rented a flat (apartment) that had a fully equipped kitchen, so, as a (retired) chef, I took advantage of being able to cook with great ingredients while in London. Good times!||May 3, 2014
Fredrik A||50||My favorite in London. A great place to spend the day walking around tasting the numerous dishes, baked goods etc. offered. A lot colder here then outside, so bring an extra sweater.||May 3, 2014
Krissydon||40||A great place to browse the local produce, meats, and other artisan goods. Great to go for a meal before starting the day. If you enjoy coffee, there's a Monmouth across the way. Some of the food vendors can be a bit cheeky. One of the food vendors (the row of food vendors at the back), was selling flat bread. He made a beautiful chicken flatbread for a customer in line, which settled what I was going to get. The item wasn't on his menu board. I asked for one of the same. By the time he made mine, I asked if it was the price of the shrimp flat bread or the price I overheard him charge the earlier customer. He charged me the higher price for the shrimp. He also took the orders of the locals (who were behind us in line) before ours. I understand treating the locals first, especially in a busy time, but charging the non locals more? Cheeky. Another dessert vendor tried to charge me more than the price on her signage. Cheeky..However, another dessert vendor (an Ozzie) was being super friendly with her patrons and even helping the tourists with how to easily identify the different coinage.||May 2, 2014
KiaOraKiwi||50||A wonderful place to visit. Lots of food stalls, fruit, veges and cheeses. Plus of course Asian, Indian, American and British takeaway food available. Oh and the cakes! The free from bakehouse and world, the fudge place. .. yummy. The best time to go to.the market would be a Thursday, Friday or Saturday to make the most of the full market rather than just the option that are available for lunch on the other days. Well worth checking out.||May 2, 2014
Cecile009||40||The Borough market London is paradise. I went on a Saturday, that you should definitely not do, cause it is insanely crowded then, but it is very visiting worthy. Food from all over the world, delicious smells all over the market, there is so much you don't even know where to look. The market is very characteristic and the neighborhood is cozy and nice. It is very close walking distance to the Tate Modern so definitely worth combining those two things on one day.||May 2, 2014
rachberlin||50||My fiance and I headed here for lunch during one of our days in London. We each had the fish & chips from Fish! Kitchen - while they were delicious (probably the best I've had), we both wished we would have shared an order instead of each getting our own. We were too full after eating to enjoy any of the other many offerings at Borough Market! If you're with someone else or a large group, share whatever you're trying so you can sample a lot of different things. Be prepared to eat!||April 30, 2014
NilsHeckscher||40||This is by now an institution and even though it has long been discovered by tourists you can feel that it somehow retained a local flavour. The variety and quality of food is brilliant. We had a variety of food ranging from Curry Wurst to Pad thai, and from gluten free brownies to choc chip cooking from France. Pricing is reasonable I guess, even though travelling with South African Rand makes everything look hugely expensive. Our daughters enjoyed this market as much as we did,||April 29, 2014
JayemkayCanberra||40||This is a food market. There are a variety of foods available ranging from meats, fish, fruit and veg, cheeses and wines to baked goods and take away hot foods to eat while browsing.We ate a selection of different freshly shucked oysters at Haward's Oyster Bar and bought some pies with interesting flavour combinations for a quick dinner at home before the theatre. Fruit was well priced and fresh as even rasberries lasted a few days.But be prepared for some crowding, especially at the ready to eat hot food stalls. To be expected I guess given the variety of food available in one spot.||April 29, 2014
emiliahija||50||Come hungry! This is an expansive market full of all sorts of delights, located in an east London neighborhood that is full of quirk and charm. Be sure to check out the lovely little shop that has foodstuffs from Croatia. When the market closes at 5 pm, it closes at 5, so be sure to get there in plenty of time. Some vendors do start selling their offerings at a discounted price at closing time. ||April 29, 2014
676ashleighb||50||Borough Market was one of the highlights of my trip to London. We went in around lunchtime and sampled a few things. There's one stand with Argentinian empanadas which was fantastic. Great atmosphere and a great time!||April 28, 2014
ysllovetravel||50||We visited Borough Market on a Friday noon, it is a open square food court with a large market which have seafood, ham, wine etc. The Bagels there is the best we've tried in London, much more great than famous on eat Brick Lane.||April 27, 2014
knabes13||50||There are plenty of food vendors here with all kinds of things to tempt your taste buds. Plan to come here so you can eat. ||April 27, 2014
PabloNeo||50||Long gone are the days when you can't find the highest quality produce in London. Things have changed immeasurably in the past 20 years and Borough Market has it all. From uber-organic farm produce to incredible niche cheeses to amazing Iberian specialty shops to remarkable bread specialists whose produce would hold its own up against any german or french boulangerie. Had a fantastic lunch at Elliots within the Market who access the freshest and best ingredients from the market for their daily menu. All in all a must for anyone who has more than a life-sustaining interest in food. Mega-foodies will be the most impressed.||April 27, 2014
Diandjeff||40||This foodie market was a great place to wander for a few hours and a great place to have some lunch. After wandering about we elected to join the rather long queue for a roast hog and rocket roll. Excellent choice! A whole hog complete with delicious aroma and perfect crackling was hard to pass up. Would definitely recommend this for lunch.The rest of the market was enjoyable too. Delicious cheeses that are offered for tasting before buying; olives; breads and fresh fruit and vegetables. Raspberries - two punnets for £1.50! About a fifth of the price they are at home...two punnets please!||April 27, 2014
equus5||50||Oh how I wish Borough market was in my home town. The vendors present a wide range of delightful foods that appeal to the adventurous palate. The food stalls are excellent. And there are several good restaurants in the area as well. ||April 26, 2014
Altamum||40||It was great food, great fun visiting the market with my siblings.We ate, walked, bought and talked!!!Just missed the "old" pub that I had on my must do/see list....||April 25, 2014
enjoyyourholiday_12||40||I'm not a big fan of markets, but this is a food market and it is a nice experience. Everything looks delicious and the free samples are enjoyable. It isn't cheap but good quality. Go and see (and taste) it if you are in the neighbourhood.||April 25, 2014
JP M||50||Great to go to if you are a foodie and live to explore. This market is more of a huge indoor,outdoor deli rather than an old style London Market so you don't usually go there to your grocery shop.Go to the award winning Pie lady that sells English pork pies in every size imaginable.To the rear RHS is a couple that sell british bakery goods and we found REAL Eccles cakes again award winning.Lastly: the fish monger stand sells all its fish HALF PRICE at the end of the day. Lobsters,crab,fish,oysters ..everything. You have to be a bit noisy to get there attention though ad it was bedlam.||April 24, 2014
Snowy874||40||A meat, produce and bread market. High quality, nicely arranged. Market is clean with rubbish receptacles available, but restrooms not well marked. The hot food carts average 4-10L per person. Lots of lovely bread vendors as well as cheese, pastries and fresh meat and seafood. Lots of men in suits, usually a sign of generous portions at a reasonable price. Pick and mix salads for the veggie people, and sausages on a stick for the low carb crowd. Well worth a look.||April 24, 2014
sleepingruby||50||I usually avoid markets because I often find them crowded and full of pushy vendors, but I was very happy to discover Borough Market had neither. I arrived around 11am on a Friday and, while busy, it was by no means uncomfortable. There's a great selection of cooked foods to choose from (I had the famous grilled cheese sandwich), but it was the fresh produce that I loved most. I appreciated the free samples and knowledgable vendors, and bought way more than I had planned because everything looked too good to pass up! Definitely worth a visit.||April 23, 2014
david0wens88||50||I love this place - food heaven.... breads, cheeses, fresh fruits and veg, meats, fish.... food prepared to eat there and then, food to go, food to take home...Local produce, international flavours.... cured meats, beers, wines...Basically - get hungry, get to London Bridge, visit and enjoy......||April 23, 2014
NyMaxdad||50||Lots of fun if you like food. Place is crazy! Wonderful cheeses, breads, pastries and cured meats. Some good prepared foods as well. Buy lunch and eat on the steps of the church next door. We loved it!||April 23, 2014
KathyOMurcia||50||This Artisan Market is a hive of activity selling an abundance of various food stuffs ranging from Olives to Thai street food! Tasters are to hand so you can sample before you buy! We plan to go again at Christmas and are already looking forward to it!!||April 23, 2014
DamienR363||50||So many different stalls here, some of the food there is quite similar and frequent but there is enough variety to cater for everyone! Just grab a cider and walk around and pick from different stalls until you find exactly what you like. Always busy but a good crowd that keeps moving! Allow for maybe 1.5 hours.||April 23, 2014
Sharon H||40||There is food from all over the world to be found here plus plenty of fresh produce such as meat, cheese, breads, cakes and fruit and vegetables. Somewhat pricey but you will find things here not normally found in supermarkets. It is an experience but if you do not like crowds I would suggest you go early otherwise it can be a bit of a bun fight!||April 22, 2014
GuyAndGalOnTheMove||50||I visit at least one market in every city I visit and this tops my list. Where to start? The atmosphere is incredible - loads of people but all good natured and out to explore. All the free samples keep people happy and also get them buying. The items for sale seemed fairly priced. We ate lunch and it was amazing. I had the homemade Italian and it was so fresh and delicious. My husband had Thai and really liked it. We had our own soda and water and were glad we brought them. We sat in the courtyard of the church next door to eat and it was a friendly place. Be sure to visit during your holiday in London. If I lived there, I think this would be a weekly visit for me. Amazing!||April 22, 2014
AlfieB_13||50||We had heard so much about Borough Market we just had to go although Easter Saturday possibly wasn't he best to choose as it was packed. However for a real buzz and loads of interesting foods to see it was still worth the visit. So much choice of food and drinks to buy for a snack or meal you'll be spoilt for choice. Be prepared to queue for you food it's really popular but it tasted great||April 20, 2014
worldtraveller479||50||Had a great saturday morning walking around borough market, sampling and buying lots of delicious food. If you enjoy food, you'll love this market. There is a great atmosphere and it's the perfect place to have a coffee and a croissant for breakfast. One of my favourite markets in London!||April 20, 2014
AaronMandel||50||A very fun place to visit while visiting the area around the Globe and Southwark Cathedral. A wonderful place for a meal as well. Certainly worth a special trip if you are a foodie. There has been a lot of movement in England recently regarding pride in English cuisine and this is the place to try it. ||April 19, 2014
Craig-World-Travelle||50||I went to Borough Market on a Saturday and had a great time and great food. This is the ultimate farmers market. Very upscale. The vendors in the market and the surrounding stores in the area have the most incredible cheese, meats, vegetables, baked goods and other food products from around the world - all beautifully displayed. It gets crowded so get their early if you go on Saturday. It is just a block from the London Bridge tube stop (off Jubilee line). I ate the duck sandwich and red sangria wine for lunch and loved the sample of cheeses they had. My friend had the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich. I will definitely go back next time I'm in London.||April 19, 2014
Lingling35100||40||I love local markets. It reflects the life of the everyday person. Borough market, steeped in history is one such market. It carries fruits, vegetables, meats, local produce such as cheese, breads, cakes, drinks, wines and an array of freshly cooked hot foods like pasta, fish and chips, kebabs etc. it is very crowded. I had English breakfast, game burger, oysters, pasta and sangria. Too bad I had limited stomach capacity. I will go back again.||April 19, 2014
Melina O||50||If you love food, come here! My boyfriend and I wanted to eat everything in sight. The meat pies, the burgers, the saugages! The chocolates, the tea, everything! Go there and eat!||April 18, 2014
Ohnonotbarbie||40||A nice walk around the stalls followed a trip to the tate modern. A short distance away along the riverbank. Stroll past the globe theatre and plenty places to eat. The market has a wide variety of stalls and food outlets. There is a lack of a pastry stall or chocolate. Plenty of cheese and cooked meat stalls. Gorgeous mushroom stall and super tomatoes. Some items are reasonably priced but overall you are paying for quality. Easy access from London bridge tube. ||April 18, 2014
morl8tr||50||We had lunch here, a family of four. Everyone got something they thought was great. There's a Neal's Yard Dairy here, so everybody had some nice cheese too. You can buy great food in the market, then eat sitting on the grass in the adjacent church yard. Get there early, though. The crowds really start to mount up around noon...||April 17, 2014
Stephanie W||50||What a lovely place, me and my partner are not local to London and found this market amazing, nothing to this standard near us! As we both work in the catering trade it was food heaven! Fresh produce and the smells are to die for! So much to choose from we just ate a little from each stall! Soul food was brilliant, brought back flavours of our Jamaica holiday :-) I would recommend this place to anyone! Wish is was a little closer to shop here weekly!||April 17, 2014
Louis M||50||Our son bought for our anniversary present a trip around Borough Market which was through Cecilia Brookes a really good person to show you around. Cecilia runs a business of showing people a gastronomis tour, and she does this really well. The whole experience of the market is great, the variety of foods and drink available is excellant. A great day out and we have already organised our next visit.||April 16, 2014

Everything from venison to wild boar to pork and more with wine and beer available as well. Either eat as you go, find a spot by Southwark Cathedral and sit while enjoying your finds, or as many people were doing, fill a bag full of delights and enjoy it later at home. Either way this is a fantastic place to experience near London Bridge. It is open Thursday through Sunday so plan accordingly because you do not want to miss it. As mentioned there are great restaurants that ring the market as well as a couple of great pubs. Don't be worried about the crowds as it is a big area but I would be aware of your purse and wallet as it seems like a good area for pick pockets to operate. Just use your head and enjoy!||April 16, 2014
tom8667||50||Nice place to spend a Friday lunchtime. Lots of food stalls and pubs on the river. Nearest tube station is London bridge. ||April 16, 2014

xtyeisu||50||Want to get off the tourist trail & see a bit of real London?... Saturday morning at Borough market should tick all the boxes!Amazing stalls with great variety of food from all over the World.. a real foodie delight. All this and surrounded by great restaurants & pubs as well!||April 15, 2014
AditiDubai_U_A_E||40||I visited this market on a weekday afternoon with my son. As we strolled lazily around the different stalls, the sights and smell of food amazed us. There was a vegetable stall,( a special mention)Turnips, selling herbs and mushrooms. The lady introduced us to a new plant, named samphire, also known as the asparagus of the sea. She also recommended the King Oyster mushrooms for the fresh Mussels we had bought from the Furness Fish. It was a delight to exchange recipes and food facts with the stall owners. The Borough Wines introduced us to a delightful French dessert wine. Street foods from different parts of the world were displayed and sold. There was a stall, Drunken Cheese, selling cheese, bathed in wine! Shoppers moved, talked and chose from an array of stalls, exchanging ideas, currency and smiles!||April 15, 2014
70ish||40||This is well worth a visit with fantastic food from around the world the most gorgeous artisan breads and I found my favourite Portuguese tarts.Meats cheeses fruits vegetables sweets even bags to carry your purchases home in.There are stalls selling every type of food I wish I lived locally!||April 13, 2014
loupeter||50||If you are a foodie, whether gourmet or gourmand, this is not to miss. When you go, don't take breakfast. I found there to be too many cheese stalls it was confusing to choose. But there are gems-like the bomba paella in one stall, the liver,bacon and onion or wild sausage bap in one, the ice cream milkshakes in one. Endless. One trip will not be enough to enjoy this. There is free tasting offered by most vendors. Bring cash- but most are not expensive. Oh, this is food paradise.||April 13, 2014
488rebeccap||50||You have to go here! Amazing atmosphere - with the typical hustle and bustle of a market. We tried different foods that were on offer and all were delicious! If we were locals we wouldn't be able to keep away!||April 13, 2014
MaryB073||50||I love this place and its vibe! I visited and explored this market with my husband and daughter on a great weather day. There were enough food vendors and choices to make it difficult for us to decide where we would eat - wrap sandwiches, roasted pork, noodle dishes, chicken kabobs, etc. We all made different choices and felt rewarded by our decisions. In addition to the food items, there were other craft and specialty items on sale. We really enjoyed our day and the festive scenery here. The is a highly recommended visit to make.||April 13, 2014
joy_hood||50||I visited Borough Market before going to the O2. I need to go again!! So much produce, everywhere smelt divine. Bread,cheese,meat and vegetables. Plenty of choice for street food. I don't think it was expensive. Being vegetarian I had the most gorgeous falafel and salad wrap for £4.00. Go early and spend a few hours there. Need someone to carry all your purchases!! ||April 13, 2014
milktruck169||50||Visited Borough Market and the surrounding area Thurs 10th April 2014 on a lovely warm spring day.The aromas hit you as soon as you enter the area.The market has a huge diversity of stalls, fresh fish & meats. Breads, cheeses, cakes fruit and drinks to name but a few.Stalls covering places from afar, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, UK to name but a few. There are numerous busy hot & cold takeaway food stalls for a quick bite, a truly lovely place to visit.The market is situated in the Borough of Southwark just over the River Thames at London Bridge, beneath the railway archways close to London Bridge Railway Station and has a underground station opposite it's entrance, so is easily accessed as well as by many bus routes.The Shard a iconic landmark is only metres away as well is HMS Belfast and the Local Guy's Hospital.The market is in a lovely area with many pubs, bars and restaurants from its entrance through the nearby little streets to the river side.Oyster bars, deli bars & wine bars line it's routes, the Fish bar restaurant is slotted in nicely amongst the stalls carry on down the street and you'll find wine shops packed full with the worlds wines, patisserie slotted I as well as the usual coffee shops.Head 20 yards further in and you come to the Golden Hind 2 situated along side a lovely gastro pub The old Thameside inn.A short walk along Clink street apptly name has it as it's own museum of the local Victorian police cells worthy of a visit and you pass more eating establishments from build your own burger to nando's. This is we're you will find a little jewel in the crown. A lovely riverside pub run by The Fuller Brewery famous for its London Pride Beer amongst others. The pub is called the Anchor, and is a busy bar with a good cross of people visiting from day trippers, students and local business men/women. Serving a wide range of beers wines spirits as well as gastro pub food. The pub has it's own restaurant if you prefer to eat away from the bar, and why not sit outside on the river bank terrace which has it's own bar, here you can sit in the sun watch the world go by on the river or walk way in front of you.As you can see this is a lovely area to visit and start or finish a lovely day out. From here follow the river visiting Shakespeare's globe theatre and continue on to the London Eye and London Dungeons arriving at Westminster Bridge and the view across the Thames to the Houses of Parliament.As you can see I walked and visited many places along this short stretch of the London riverside. Never planned just explored and found little places to stop and visit. Try it yourself I know you won't be disappointed, check for market days though.||April 12, 2014
lillyaa||50||all the food you dream about and you have never heard about. the sweets look delicious and you can always try new things. it's a treat.||April 12, 2014
nick w||40||Borough market is extremely popular and gets very, very busy on a Saturday especially with tourists and Londoners alike descending in hordes on the various food and drink stalls. There is a great range of fruit, vegetables, meats. drinks, fish, seafood, breads, pastries, chocolates, oils etc, etc available from the myriad stalls. There are also a large number of street food stalls selling a range of vegetarian and meat options from around the globe. However, these often have massive ques and a wait of 20 minutes plus to get served is not uncommon.My tip is to bring a knife and purchase the ingredients you need for a wonderful picnic from the market stalls themselves which are always slightly quieter than the street food stalls and then assemble and eat your picnic at your leisure on the southbank or in one of the nearby pocket parks.||April 12, 2014
jewelsoo7||40||Loved it. Yes it is very very busy and crowded. I went on a Saturday. I thought the prices were fair. If was more local would stock up. Lots of things to try. Also had a great atmosphere. Lovely duck roll and chorizo roll!||April 12, 2014
KiwiStevefromSW15||50||Well worth a 3 hour wonder. Closest London Underground - London Bridge. The market is a series of independent food stalls. Selling seafood, thru steaks, with a selection of European Cheese and meats ( Italian Palma Hams / Sausages ) olives, truffles, balsamic vinegars, chocolates sweets and fruits seriously the list would go on and on and on. Plus you can get a coffee or Tea (or go wine tasting) while your there. It covers about 3 blocks it's semi undercover, so would be ok in light rain. I was very impressed on my visit. We then walked down the Thames on the Southbank past Shake-spears globe to the Tate Modern looked at a Picasso and over the bridge to embankment ( 2 adults and 4 kids - aged 5-10 ) they all said they had a very good day ( took 5 hours about - meandering ). Was a nice way to spend a morning a morning in London.||April 12, 2014
Snapper440||40||Borough a Market seems to have become a tourist attraction rather than somewhere to go to buy food. On a Friday or Saturday it's difficult to move in the restricted space available. This wasn't helped by more than one person with a tripod erected in the middle of the walkway! I fear that it's reputation may eventually kill this market as I saw very few people buying anything, most were just wandering around taking in the spectacle of people wandering around........||April 12, 2014
Kei D||50||If you come from countries where there are excellent proper markets then you should go to this one also, it's a bit different from the traditional real market, but it's a quite unique style market a bit posh but an excellent market really good , we go there manyany time it's my favorite in London al the products are of very good quality, a place not to miss ||April 10, 2014
Roger P||50||Heaven for the foodys. What a place only in Beijing have i come across so many people in one place (we went on a saturday) it was a bit clostraphobic for me but my friends had a ball. Plenty of food to taste and of course an assortment of drinks to try but i suggest going in the week when its not so crowded and not so many long lines waiting to be served. Yes go.||April 9, 2014
Wayne D||40||Absolute food and drink heaven but have your wits about you it's so busy..... Saying that get stuck in a nice juice or even a glass of bubbly and the choice is endless if food is your passion this market is a must!||April 8, 2014
abigalem2016||30||I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more if I didn't go on a Saturday. It was so busy it was hard to walk around. We enjoyed the food we found for lunch, but the lines were so long we didn't sample very much. If you don't mind crowds you might enjoy Borough Market; if you do dislike crowds, avoid Saturdays.||April 7, 2014
SheffieldS_13||50||This place comes alive on Saturdays. A piece of advice - go on an employ stomach. The sheer number of stalls hawking food of various nationalities and culture is astounding. From cooked food to dried goods, bakeries, cheeses, organic food and fruits, the whole place is packed with locals and tourists. Take your tme to browse among all the staffs and once you have,axe your purchases, walk to the grounds of Southwark Church and take a seat and enjoy your food. Wonderful experience.||April 7, 2014
Russell J||50||If you want to get a flavour of what London used to be like then this is the place. Great variety on everything from chees to wine, paella to fruit!An enjoyable experience if you dodn't mind the hustle and bustle of the crowds.||April 7, 2014
Andrew J||50||That place is amazing. You can find so many type of culture and generation. The atmosphere is nice and prices of cloths are cheap.||April 5, 2014
Martin S||50||The Borough Market is an open air market under a bridge so it's protected from the weather. Booths sell sausages, cheeses, olives, bread, cakes, ice cream, and a variety of hot food. It's easy to spend an hour just sampling the variety before deciding on what to eat or buy. It's right outside the London Bridge tube stop, so it's easy to find.||April 4, 2014
Dweeja P||50||Went there for the first time just to have a feel of market. It was busy on Saturday afternoon but was a nice experience. Liked the food stalls and the food served. Would definitely visit again! ||April 3, 2014
Jami Kath H||50||Kicking myself for never visiting Borough Market before this trip. Anyone with an appreciation for food will find this place heaven. I highly recommend visiting with someone who doesn't mind sharing their food. To make the most of the market, pick up dishes from several of the food stalls and pass them around. We had an amazing roast pork sandwich (with crispy skin and applesauce.) If it is nice out, take your food to the courtyard outside Southward Cathedral. Walk off the first meal (visit the Cathedral and surrounding area) before coming back for round two. Also, the food vendors are all very generous with samples. Don't hesitate to ask or join the crowd. We tastes some of the best cured meats, cheese, vinegar, and mustard we've ever had. Grab some snacks to stash in your hotel minifridge for those late night munchies. London's street food scene is so vibrant, that you could really avoid the touristy restaurants and just spend your days eating at places like this.||April 3, 2014
655KatieM655||50||We thoroughly enjoyed spending the morning wandering around Borough Market. Find the grilled cheese guys!! It's the most amazing sandwich you'll ever eat!!!||April 2, 2014
LedoMellingLiverpool||50||Loved Borough Market, from the arrival at Southwark Cathedral side you are hit by the smells and atmosphere, there is so much food to choose from. If the weather is nice you can have a picnic in the courtyard of the Cathedral, we had a glass of pink prosecco whilst strolling around the market, it felt so decadent. It really is a foodies paradise and well worth a visit. We went on a Saturday and it was so busy and bustling with all walks of life, it's just lovely.||April 1, 2014
Janet B||50||Love and adore this market as a food/foodie lover this is one of the best by far markets! I get withdrawal symptoms when I'm not there love the place so many lovely food stalls spoilt for choice! Am now itching to go back again 10/10||March 31, 2014
Lisa C||50||The array of food is superb, meats, fish, chutneys, cheese , vegetables, herbs through to cakes and huge meringues! Even had chocolate wine this weekend! Go early as by lunchtime it is heaving and less chance to see and taste samples.||March 31, 2014
MariaJ427||40||This was a great experience. The food stalls are full of fresh and tsty produce. I bought a massive chicken wrap for £5 and would give this visit a 5 star if I had found somewhere to sit and eat it without being jostled by the crowds. Most stalls have free samples and I bought a wonderful selection of Italian cheeses for Mothers Day which we all thoroughly enjoyed.||March 31, 2014
ManfredLdn||50||Great place to visit especially on a Saturday. There is a constant buzz of freshness no matter the weather. From fresh juices, to organic bread and prime cured & fresh meats, it's a nice place to visit.Borough Market feels like a village market, where everyone knows each other.||March 30, 2014
isdn4u||50||If you only have 3 hours to spare, this is a great mini-tour:Go early on a weekend morning as the vendors are opening their stands. Its pleasant and not crowded, and fun to watch as the vendors carefully set up their stands with foods. Many are happy to chat versus by about 10am when it gets crowded and crazy. Many vendors give small samples--- be polite and just take one sample. After that, you are just being greedy. Afterwards, take a stroll along the Thames. On a sunny day, you can walk either direction from London Bridge and see many sights. I took in St Paul's Cathedral as well. Great photo opportunities.||March 30, 2014
anujkundarap||50||I go to Borough Market just for the foods. Most amazing place to go explore.. It's amazing how this market takes you back to the culture or farmers selling their produce directly to customers, while at the same time being right in the middle of London. Must visit for an education in world foods. ||March 30, 2014
AymanN||50||Another lovely visit to borough market. It was lively on a Friday at lunch time but a great treat for the senses, we sampled a few things before settling on a Thai green curry and a sandwich from roast. Got to say, roast won for me! Definitely worth a visit, food is fresh and tasty. ||March 30, 2014
Pat H||50||Arriving on the South Bank, you will find an International feast located under the bridges and overpasses located near the London Bridge tube stop and next to the Southwark Cathedral. It was an amazing array of food vendors, pubs, cafes, shops and you can literally eat your way around the world. The variety of food is overwhelming and you really need to spend some time just walking through the different corridors and alleyways to see all that is offered. There are also a number of restaurants and pubs if you want to sit down, relax and enjoy your food the old fashioned way. But save that for later - and explore the various stands for unique food and drink offerings. There are plenty of the old standards as well, so don't pass it up because you like simple fare. We sampled so many different items and purchased several to take home with us. Everything is available - from the fresh fish and meat and vegetables stands to the cooked in front of you samples from around the world. I could have stayed for hours and snacked all day. I went based on reviews I had read - but the market far surpassed my expectations. It was the best morning we spent in London!||March 29, 2014
mg-wickham||50||This is a place where you could start at lunch and then just keep eating until dinner ;).Great atmosphere, and lots of sampling available. Whether bread, paella, oysters, pesto, tea, goat milk ice cream, or Turkish delights - it's a perfect place to spend lunch and afternoon and treat your palate to a variety of excellent food. [Mushroom pâté was probably my favourite there :).]||March 26, 2014
Minnis3333||50||Everything is so well placed, and nice looking. Many possibilities to have lunch. We ate chiken on stick and chinese. Really good! ||March 26, 2014
Paichan83||50||If you like visiting markets, you can't miss this one. You can find a lot of different kind of foods - I even found a gluten-free pastries stand! Also, it is a perfect place to buy something to eat while walking down the Queen's Way. Give it a try!||March 26, 2014
EdinburghRox||50||Located close to London Bridge, this market is a food lovers heaven. Unusual breads, gorgeous cakes, cheeses, fish, meats, fruit and veg, spices; it's all there. You can eat at one of the many little hot and cold food and beverage stalls, shop for quality fresh provisions, or simply browse and marvel at the feast of colours and smells on show. This market is well worth a visit if you're in the area.||March 25, 2014
Ben V||50||It's really nice place. Pretty expensive but all food is yummy. Everyone must try almond croissants and different kind of cheesecakes! Also, paella is wonderful there :)||March 25, 2014
ldeimos||50||Borough Market is an absolutely astonishing place full of vendors from all over, each offering their foods, meats, and harvests. Absolutely amazing place. Sheer selection of offerings was a delight to wander through. Hidden gems made it an adventure. The knowledge contained inside the merchant’s brains about their product was incredible. I learned more about tea in twenty minutes than I’ve gathered in 24 years. Lots of more exotic offerings that made me want to broaden my food horizons. A must visit while in London.||March 25, 2014
xuda30||40||It’s a must visit; add in your bucket list right now!!! We entered the market on a typical rainy London afternoon. There is sooooo much food/drinks/dessert everywhere. It was super confusing what to have, so we started off with Argentinian empanadas which according to me were quite oily. Then we tried the paella and it was delicious. Next we moved on to salted beef & mustard sandwich. Apparently the duck sandwiches are a must have but we missed it. Nibbled on a lot of cheese, packing some Comte is a must; Sipped on some champagne and mulled wine. Dessert was a super delicious drool worthy Banoffee slice, ended with some Turkish coffee and Turkish Delights!! Seems like quite a melting pot, doesn’t it! It’s super fulfilling, if I had more space in my tummy would have loved to try some more stuff.||March 25, 2014
sashag469||50||Comfort over fashion here is key you will eat until your belly swells, have wine & do it again several times in a few hours. We came here on our last day in London & I regret we waited until then once I bit into the sandwich, I suggest as mentioned going early it gets packed with the bankers at lunch & they run out. The Argentinian empanada stand is also scrumptious I suggest grabbing a wine barrel seat at the wine stand across from it, ordering a glass & enjoying your tasty scavenge. We brought a scotch egg all the way back to Boston, & enjoyed it 10 hrs later. This is a MUST when there especially if you have a vacation rental & need groceries. I would suggest doing a full lap this place will give you the munchies even if not high & you might fill your belly before getting to the good stuff. Find a way to smuggle cheese from here back home & make a melty tomato, cheddar & cress sandwich to ease back to reality when you get home from vacation....it helps||March 24, 2014
MysteryGuestRochdale||50||Borough Market is an institution and every visit feels like a new experience.Whatever you do don't eat before you arrive! The varied stalls mean you can virtually eat around the world, it really is fantastic.Stand out stalls are Portena which sells Argentinian empanadas (amazing) and the Ginger Pig which has great porkie products.||March 24, 2014
Mel-Si1||50||We enjoyed a few hours here on Friday, beginning with a cheeky glass of prosecco each at 10.30am! There are plenty of stalls, sweet and savoury from many different countries, many stall owners are able to offer small samples/tasters and some of the food to buy for lunch is amazing, we enjoyed a pulled pork and slaw bap.It wasn't overly busy as some people describe but I imagine the weekends can get quite hectic. A great market to return to again and again.||March 24, 2014
ok78||50||WOW busy busy it was in fact rammed shoulder to shoulder...SO much food /drink cheese sauces/meat and cakes...THE choice is endless...i loved the vegan/veggie stalls but the qs were far to long for a second helping.everything was set out so nicely...somethings were a little over priced but whats to be expected..TAKE a rucksake as u sure will want to buy what they have on offer...NOT for small children,buggys on a saturday as it was just unmovable in some isles.||March 23, 2014
Will S||50||The street food in Borough Market is so good. You get there and the smell just hits you and instantly you're famished. The hardest part is deciding what you want!||March 23, 2014
Megan D||40||Borough Market is an intense experience, so much food, so many people. Cheese shops are everywhere along with craft beers, exotic meats, spices, bakeries, a very large selection of prepared for purchase - and that is just the tip of the iceberg! It is very very busy (rammed even)on there on Saturdays, be prepared||March 22, 2014
Dix60||50||Then go and test an amazing array of fantastic food from around the world in one visit. Or just bring a big bag and take all the exciting flavour home to try.||March 22, 2014
emelian||50||Always go here for breakfast at Maria's and a look round the market when in london.Great selection of specialty foods and snacks. Go hungry as you can get a meal from all the tasting samples. Not cheap but amazing array of foods.||March 22, 2014
jillhking||50||My daughter loves the market and took me there, brilliant, lots places to eat and so much choice of food, all sorts, really enjoyed it .will go again.||March 22, 2014
jbfalcons||50||Very cool market on the south side of the Thames. An easy walk to the Tate, the Globe and Tower of London. Highly recommended and if you go hungry you wont be disappointed in all the incredible choices of food to choose from. During the week is better than weekend when many of the vendors are closed||March 21, 2014
peterschofield37||50||Even if your not a great foodie the hustle & bustle of Borough Market is great. Lots of interesting stalls and pubs & cafes to get a drink or something to eat. There is a real buzz about the place.||March 21, 2014
RacerMomIL||50||We were amazed at the variety! Spices, olives, candy, bakery, dairy, fresh fruit, fresh meat, cheese, adult beverages, etc. etc.. Oooh, the smells! Thai, Middle Eastern cooked on premises. It all looked so good (and what we sampled, or purchased and consumed tasted so yummy).Could have stayed there from open to close.Very clean.Crowded, but what in London isn't?Purchased three fruit marmalade and am thoroughly enjoying here back in the U.S. (One of my goals was to purchase marmalde-somewhere-on our trip.)||March 19, 2014
Hanthonythomas||50||Finally got a chance to visit the market after several visits to London. Why did we wait so long? A great collection of local foods and a knowledge base on the origin of each food to rival any. To stroll around is to tour the UK through its bounty of the land and sea. If the sights are not enough to temp you then the aromas of cooking food and the sights of others eating will soon have even the hard-fast dieter enjoying the offerings. The prices were reasonable and even less expensive than other areas of London. Lots of tourist taking pictures and making purchases made for a pleasant atmosphere and a great way to spend a morning.||March 19, 2014
Beth176||40||Fabulous market with loads of fresh produce which you can try before you buy. Superb takeaway stalls although getting to them was challenging as it was so busy.||March 18, 2014
llcgator||50||Unique eats, big crowds, lots to taste, see, and try. VERY clean. I am super paranoid when it comes to eating from markets but this place was very clean and reputable. I had lots of seafood, meats, cheeses, and dairy with zero problems. I really enjoyed the farmer's market which had a wide selection of fruits and veggies. We tried goats milk ice cream, seafood and rice, oysters on the half shell, stew, cheeses, and candies. Go with and appetite and enjoy!||March 17, 2014
Fleckapuppy||50||We don't seem capable of visiting the London now without going to Borough market. Love the vibe and of course the incredible selection of food & drink on offer. We now have to have sausages in buns from The Boston sausage company .... Possibly the best I've ever had.... And some of the cake & cheese stalls! If you are a foodie you must visit, although if you don't like crowds I would stay away as it can be heaving at times.||March 17, 2014
AverageJo86||40||I would love to say how rubbish this is to try and keep it a secret but their is little chance of that! This is just a very good (if busy) place to try some excellent British (and non british) cooking, food and produce. You can sample a little of everything and i can only wish every British town had a market like this.||March 17, 2014
Fabio G||40||The market is located few steps from the underground station of London Bridge, so it is easily reachable. It is often quite busy and full of people, so avoid it if you do not like crowds. The market is bursting with stalls full of amazing quality food from all around the globe, you can buy some amazing ingredients, but also have lunch/snacks there. And most of the things sold are reasonably priced. I really like some of the burgers sold there and am crazy for the fudge stall. But there is something for everybody and around it you can find a lot of pubs, shops and place to eat/drink (including a chocolate factory very nice!).The only downside is that most stalls close quite early, also during weekends. At 5/6 pm you will find most of it already closed...||March 16, 2014
Simon W||50||so whats good, its free... but you will spend a fortune on all the wonderful cheese, meat, pies, sandwiches, oils... foodie fun!so whats bad... its just too popular.. but I wouldnt have it anyother way. go early, dont go on saturday, go hungry||March 16, 2014
foodguruchannel||50||Cured meats, breads, desserts, Thai Food, Middle Eastern treats, fresh fruit, and more are all part of the local and international foodie flavors in this Southwark neighborhood. Have your mouth open, stomach on empty, and arms free for some serious sampling of edibles, and souvenirs on your trip in London and for back home. http://www.food-guru.com/in-and-out-of-london/||March 15, 2014
Jeff H||50||Where to start? Yea, they do sell some stuff that I would call weird like Zebra burgers... I have never seen so much cheese. And Scotch eggs? Yes please!||March 13, 2014
RaphaelGG||50||Just loved, fresh food, plenty of choice to mark, sometimes is difficult to decide what to with, because everything looks fantastic. If you come to London, you most visit it. From Thursdays to Saturdays only,||March 11, 2014
802andrewh||50||Have wanted to visit this market for years--well worth the trip excellant stalls selling a variety of ingredientsenjoyed the street food section as wellgreat little cafe in center of the market where you can get a coffee and watch the world go by||March 11, 2014
Amy T||50||I love Borough Market for the food and always have lunch or dinner from one of the stalls when I'm there. It's always changing so you can go over and over and it doesn't get repetitive. There is a great stand with all kinds of unusual meats, they sell ready to eat kangaroo burgers which are definitely worth a try!Another of my favpurites is the mustard stall, all homemade and delicious, again try before you buy.Plenty of cheese stands and free samples for you to try. Also breads, seafood, fruit and veg, cakes and chocolate. All selling things you can't find in supermarkets. Prices might be higher than your local shop but it reflects the quality and/or uniqueness. The ready to eat food is about what you'd pay for lunch elsewhere in London so it's great valueBeing so close to the station it's worth a visit on your way past, but be prepared to carry things home with you! ||March 11, 2014
GameServer||50||We really enjoyed our morning trip to the South bank and Borough Market. Notice that the full market is open Wednesdays to Saturdays. It usually opens at 10am except on Saturday, when it opens at 8am, so it is recommended to schedule your South Bank trip on a Saturday and start with Borough Market. In the market you'll get to experience the very best of British and International fresh produce. You will find bakeries, charcuteries (yum...), dairy products, wine and spirits (take a cup of hot mulled wine to go, you'll thank me later), fish and seafood, spices, fruit and vegetables, meat, poultry and even game (try the boar saucisson).Tip: even though it's not a large market and some products look at the same, it worth your while to first explore the whole market and only then make a purchase. We encountered some products that were identical but sold on different prices by nearby traders!||March 10, 2014
TomT77||40||Liked the wide range of foodstuffs and vegetables the quality of which was superb. Prices also seemed reasonable and competitive with prices we pay in Wales for far inferior food.||March 10, 2014
fj21||50||Fabulous saturday afternoon munching! the salt beef bagel's are delicious.Huge range of cakes and sweets. Giant meringues are so so good, as was the fudge and the macaroons!I could have stayed and ate my way through till the evening!||March 10, 2014
Suzanne B||50||A great food market with many choices. If you like Turkish Delight the Turkish Deli has over 30 varieties! The stall holders/owners are friendly. Worth a visit.||March 9, 2014
mikdodd||50||Without a doubt this has to be the best food market we have ever been to and I wish we had been to it when we lived in London. Yes it's full of tourists but if I lived locally I would be filling up with artisan breads, Monmouth coffee, cheeses, charcuterie, spices, cakes etc for the weekend.What a great place to grab a glass of wine and wander around the numerous stalls.An absolute pleasure and well worth a visit.||March 9, 2014
294JulieL||50||As soon as we walked into the food market, I was rapt. I wanted to have at least four lunches - inspired by both the smell and the sight of all the lovely offerings. I had to be satisfied with one but wandered about and found some goodies to take home for 'ron (later on). It was easy to get to from St Paul's. We just walked across the Millennium Bridge, turned left past Shakespeare's Globe and straight ahead to the market.||March 8, 2014
hellokitae||50||This one of my favorite places in london. If you have even the tiniest foodie in you... Its a must go. You'll really get to experience the British food scene and all its diversity! ||March 8, 2014
Jane H||50||This area of London, not far from London Bridge, is just buzzing, with lots of things to see and do, and Borough Markets are one of those.A foodie's delight, there is every type of food and drink, from great wheels of cheese, to boutique wines and ciders, breads, pastries and cakes, game, potted meats, fresh fruit and veg, and ethnic hot dishes.My daughter and I enjoyed delicious coffee and tiny cupcakes as we strolled around the many stalls.It was a great way to spend a morning in London.||March 7, 2014
lizaHarrogate||50||I visited the market Friday morning and was amazed at all the gourmet stalls offering the most delicious samples of their wares My favourite were the Seafood stalls offering baked scallops and bacon and the juice bars The standard of foods from all over the world was extremely high and there was something to tempt every palate I can't think of a more pleasurable way to spend a couple of hours on a wet Friday morning ||March 7, 2014
59anthonyn||50||My wife and I spent a Saturday morning walking around Borough market, drooling at all the awesome food and spending our time planning our late breakfast. This is a must visit for people travelling to London to get a little more of an authentic local experience.||March 7, 2014
Shirilee46||50||Have been to the market on several occasions when having a day trip up to London to see a show or visit a museum with a very good friend of mine. The food and atmosphere are both great! Well worth a visit. Try and get there as early as you can on a Saturday as it gets VERY bissey as the day gos on||March 7, 2014
JohnF47||50||Great place to wander around, enjoy the sights sounds and smells, and partake of the goodies on offer. The variety of produce is fascinating and enticing.||March 6, 2014
teejay11||50||Great food from Pork pies to English Chorizo the best breads cheeses seafood veg.The Street is fantastic top quality cheap and large choice. op London Bridge tube station.||March 6, 2014
SydneyTraveller_2008||50||Perhaps one of the best markets in the world for food. You could easily spend a couple of hours in the markets sampling the different foods. I tried the sausage rolls from one of the butchers which was to die for. Definitely, definitely make sure you visit the markets on your trip to London. I only wish I could spend more time there.||March 6, 2014
steveAsserballeskov||50||The market and surrounding area are just a blitz of sound, smell and taste. I cannot recommend this highly enough if you want atmosphere. If you like supermarkets, Starbucks and Macdonalds it is not for you. It can be very crowded particularly on Saturdays but that adds to the buzz. As well as the market itself the surrounding area has many speciality food and drink stores. ( I particularly recommend Vinopolis its range of whiskys is truly awesome) There is a wide range of street food but only take small portions so you get a chance to try as many as possible. If you want to sit at a formica table and eat some tasteless pap and be told to have a nice day, fine but don't expect this here, it is stand and eat off a paper plate with a plastic fork. The difference is the food will actually taste of something other than ketchup.If you are not staying at a hotel buy some of the fresh food for cooking your own meals, the range and quality is spectacular.||March 5, 2014
Maria U||40||Great day out on a Saturday when the sun was shining (finally) - but the crowds slightly overwhelming! A good variety of foods including cheeses, hams, fish and fresh veg! Spent a couple of hours going round the stalls and then stopped at one of the street cafes for lunch. Would recommend going, but not sure I would want to take small children as it gets very very busy.||March 5, 2014
MajeeSwanson||50||We were there on a busy Saturday! Music, food and fun. So many things to eat and enjoy. Had my first Scotch Egg and sweet potato fries. Walking through the entire market is a foodie's haven. Wonderful meats, cheeses, baked goods, pastries....The sounds and colors were a lot of fun!||March 4, 2014
Rhumsaa82||40||Well worth a visit if you are passing either for lunch or just a browse and bite to eat. Feels a little like it is trying too hard to be cool and hipster with the stalls and vibe but.... it is London.||March 4, 2014
Jasmine B||50||This is a wonderfully colourful, lively and tasty place!It's full of fantastic fresh produce and amazing cheeses, hams, pickles etc from all over the UK and beyond. It's worth going round for an hour or so and picking up some lovely bits for dinner.There are also great restaurants in the area so you can spend at least half a day there. Move on to Southwark Cathedral round the corner for a restful time afterwards. It's right next to London Bridge station so very easy to get to.||March 3, 2014
dada58||40||Don't miss this fun market full of goodies to taste and to buy. You can have quite a nice lunch there.I bought some nice spices and chutneys and tasted really ggod serrano ham. Really high end stuff.Very popular and can get quite crowded on a saturday.||March 3, 2014
JessandSaz||50||Okay if you're not keen on crowds then avoid. It is very busy especially on a Saturday lunch time. Also check when it's open as it's only wed-sat in my experience. We shared a few things to eat including the salt and pepper squid (4/5) risotto balls (amazing! 5/5) and the scotch eggs and sweet potato fries (awesome! 5/5) I'm not a scotch egg kinda girl but these were just so good and the fries were a perfect accompaniment. We went for dessert at hotel chocolate's restaurant (ace place!) and then returned to do some shopping. You can pick up some real bargains between 4:30 and 5pm like the fish and meat but be warned a lot of the cakes and breads etc will have been sold. We got everything we wanted plus some tasty extras like wild wood pesto and papered cheese. The staff on the stall were all so friendly and happy to give advise if you have a recipe in mind. Most stalls also take card but only on £10+ there are cash points around but I'd recommend taking cash to avoid queuing. We will be back at soon as possible! ||March 2, 2014
YubaPrincess||50||Suffice it to say that this place has become a weekly haunt for me. Chorizo alicante from Spain. Miele Tartufo. Black truffle balsamico from The Oil Mill. Artisanasal Breads. Burrata, stracciatella and porchetta from Gastronomia. Dover Sole from the freshmonger. THe freshest Fish&Chips from Fish Kitchen (GBP 8.95). Crab tortellini from La Tua. Alfajores from Argentina. There is even a live cooking demo to learn from!||March 1, 2014
terg12||50||The Borough Street market is the mecca of farmers markets. We went on a Saturday and it was booming (I heard weekends are best). Plenty of samples and unique handcrafted items. We ate pulled duck sandwiches, paella, and drank mojitos but sampled all kinds of cheeses, olive oils, and treats. The market is a short walk from the tube.||February 28, 2014
baby_ling||50||Pop by to get some sweet "souvenir " for my friends in Singapore as this market is strongly recommended by the hotel I am staying. Is a must -go place! And it Did not disappoint me! They have the freshest fruits,vegetables and all those you needed for cooking! Brought their handmade chocolates back for my friends and they claims the chocolate is nice! Strongly recommend tourists to make a morning trip there before the crowds come.||February 28, 2014
staherIreland||40||Don't eat before you get here! Mouth watering food in all the stalls .The problem is deciding what you want.We were there on Thurs so all stalls were open and it wasn't too crowded.. Three of us queued at 3 different stall and shared.We ate our food in the grounds of Southwark Cathedral...lovely surroundings .||February 27, 2014
LesH211||50||Fabulous selections of the best of foods from UK and continental Europe ,,, very indicative of the whole boom of great food in London, making it one of the food capitols of the world.Worth a whole day of wandering round tasting things and trying some of the restaurants.We bought things to take back to France that are hard to find where we live ... spices, bacon, sausages, cheddar cheeses and pies etc., ... wonderful stuff.We come here regularly when visiting London and stock up with goodies once a year when we come over from France by car.||February 27, 2014
HutchLondon||50||A recommended trip, as it is very easy to get to from London Bridge Station. We went on a Wednesday which I don't think is the best day as quite a get stalls were not open. Great atmosphere and plenty to look at and sample - although if you intend to buy, start saving up! We arrived at 10.45 and the market was pretty quiet but by 12.30 it was absolutely heaving, so be prepared. Would go back but probably on a Friday.||February 26, 2014
Tom_Lelifeld||50||A great food market with authentic traders offering their specialty of produce. Perfectly located near London Bridge tube Station, with a roof above your head so you don't get wet when its raining. During weekends its crowded, but definitely worth a visit!||February 26, 2014
Oliver C||50||Near London Bridge train station, This market is easily accessible from the south of London. The variety of food is jaw dropping, with food from all over the world. Although the market is not capable of holding lots of people, you should be able to enjoy it whilst looking out for people in your way. Personally I think the best stall is the German Bratwurst hotdog stand! Go visit when in London.||February 24, 2014
wucie||50||THE place to sample a whole range of foods, from savoury to sweet, vegetarian to meaty, raw to cooked.This food/street food market (it's mostly food though there are a handful of flower sellers and the Richard Bramble pottery stall) is open from Thursdays to Saturdays (shame it's closed on Sunday) and can get very crowded so it's best to come early. The closest Tube station is London Bridge but on a nice day and with time to spare, I recommend getting off at St Paul's station and walking to the market. And there's plenty to see along the way including, St Paul's Cathedral, the Millennium Bridge, the Tate Modern, the Shakespeare Globe, the Golden Hinde II, and Vinopolis (wine, whisky and food sampling tours).Once at the market you can find a whole gamut of cheeses, meats, vegetables, beverages and sweets/cakes from all over the UK and further afield. Mediterranean fare is very popular but there's also a stall selling exotic meats (ostrich, kangaroo, crocodile, antelope etc). Some of the butchers and fishmongers provide vacuum-packing but not all, so ask before you buy if you need to ship the produce home. If you'd rather sit down there are numerous restaurants, pubs and eateries to choose from. Some restaurants and stalls were hugely popular judging from the long queues. We can vouch for the salted beef sandwiches and the Sussex oysters but everything looked very tempting. Prices are on the steep side but the market is great entertainment in its own right and you can easily spend a couple of hours here.||February 24, 2014
Pamela W||50||Such a great market for food - so much choice amongst the hot meals to go and if you have a sweet tooth there are sweet treats galore. Smells and sights are fabulous. Talk to the stall holders as they will tell you where their product has come from and let you taste before you buy in a lot of cases. A great place to visit and good to take away a few different things, also good for picking up what you need for a picnic by the Thames.||February 23, 2014
sallyl172||50||It was Foodie Heaven for anyone who appreciates food and you were spoiled for choice with the amount of different street food stallsSomewhat busy - should have gone in the morning!||February 23, 2014
867aliceb||50||Some fantastic food and drink stalls - great bread, cheese and meat. A lovely place to visit on a Saturday.||February 23, 2014
Oddy B||50||Been a while since I have been to Borough Market but had a great day out today, not as busy as it used to be and everything has been made neat and tidy. There are still some fantastic food stalls and if you want to photograph food items this is a great place to go...one of my favourite photo haunts...||February 21, 2014
travel1990||50||I have been here a few times when staying in London with my Fiance and its always a lovely experience. Just walking around the We smells of the different food is always fantastic. If you're a foodie then this is the place for you, with food from all around the world. We had wild boar sausage and they were amazing! Really cannot wait to go back, though I think I may wait until summer as it was very cold.||February 20, 2014
HalDavies||50||This is the site of an historic market. I first went there in 1979 and many times thereafter when it was still the original market. Funnily enough I went there after night shifts. I always picked up some good cuts of meat and hen had a pint or five at 7 in the morning!Now it is an upmarket market, selling the best of food one can buy.Go there at a weekend, during the day and feast your eyes on great food and flowers and everything else. You will be amazed. Here are also boutique shops. Even better, there are lots of pubs selling good real ale. You can walk along the river, take in a Church, eat and be merry.Go there, you won't be disappointed.||February 19, 2014
domidge||40||Stumbled across the market on our way for dinner last Sunday.It's a great place, so much to try, eat, drink and experience.You would never know it was there. Cheeses, pastries, pizza, jams and all sorts of stalls.Get hungry and get to Borough Market.....||February 18, 2014
worldfamousjeff||50||This a great outdoor marketplace, made better by the overhead shelter from the train tracks above. I tried an Italian panino with excellent cheese in it, as well as a hot drink made of lemon, honey and ginger. There were many options for soups, sandwiches, cheese, charcuterie and dessert ... especially dessert. This is well worth a visit whatever the weather.||February 17, 2014
Britney_17||40||Borough Market is a fantastic place to visit and wander around whatever the weather. There is array of restaurants which offer a range of food and drink to either eat in or takeaway. The amount of stalls and stands is endless and offers the complete range of food, snacks, drinks and treats. The owners are friendly and always offering samples and advice. Fanastic selection.Especially nice touch is that you can buy a glass of champagne or mulled wine to wander around this - something a little special. Definitely worth a visit especially if you are a "foodie".||February 17, 2014
sarahjy||50||Foodies heaven...lot's of delicious foods from small producers, cheeses, pastries, meats, fruit and veg, etc ||February 16, 2014
izamh||40||The place was buzzing with activities when we were there... My little girl couldn't help herself but try the many samples that were on offer by the storekeepers... Remember to bring an extra big bag to lug all the things u buy when u visit the place...||February 16, 2014
MarissaMeryl||30||Visited the market yesterday and was quite frankly disappointed! Run of the mill stalls-nothing excited or intrigued me!I had a mackerel bap with tartare sauce from Fish!Kitchen and took it back for a refund-it was the most revolting thing I had tasted for a long time! Very cheap previously frozen bread roll, batter on fish very greasy and soggy-fish tasteless-cery disappointed!I have my own food business and use Hobbs House bread-it's always the bread that makes the food-why do these traders not learn that it is simply a crime to have a superb filling surrounded by a cheap (and usually stale) white bap! My partner had a chorizo roll from Brindisa however (for the same price as the mackerel) and said it was nice-artisan bread too-hooray!I feel that Borough market was distinctly average for its number of cheese and meat stalls etc and to be honest over rated compared to other markets I have visited-eg Stroud farmers market.Anyway I visited Partridges Food Market in Chelsea last Saturday-can't recommend it highly enough! Large variety of stalls and different quality foods friendly atmosphere easily accessible! Something for all the family and foodies too!||February 15, 2014
CatGLondon||50||I have visited BM on many occasions and If you are a 'foodie' or just generally like to wonder around markets (like myself) and being 'in the swing of things' then Borough Market is for you!This place has everything you could want, and more! Always a fantastic selection of everything. Some produce is not the cheapest, but if you are looking for that 'special something', you are sure to find it here.If you are a vegan, like myself, be aware that this market is very 'meat' orientated, and has alot 'on display'. It does have a few very healthy stalls, including wheatgrass shots and smoothies, and other healthy treats. The hot cider stall is very welcoming on a cold day and you can also get lots of tasters of many other foods on sale. There is plenty of fruit and veg on sale. There has even been in the past a 'bio dynamic's' stall, which is fab!In the summer it can be extremely busy (heaving, even!), but in the winter months, and on a Thursday, it will be less crowded.All in all, something for everyone, and a definite 'must visit' when in London!||February 15, 2014
SanaAshoor||50||Great food! try as many dishes as you can, and share it with friends! Also, make sure to get the right directions as it could be a little misleading||February 14, 2014
andrewrN1585PK||50||God I love Borough Market !Best breakfasts, whether you have the market experience or le Pain Quotidien - or other options of course :-)best food choices of every kind you can imagine in London, whether to eat there on the spot, or take home with youand Monmouth coffee right there on the edge of the market ! Wow ! Nuff said ? one of This reviewers' most happy places on earth :-) !||February 13, 2014
Tink802||50||I havent seen this much good food in one place for a long time!Will be visiting everytime i'm in town||February 13, 2014
Jac E||50||We try to visit this market whenever we are in London at a weekend, it never fails to impress. The range of food on offer is mind blowing - Comte cheese comes as 12 month old, 18 month, 24 month and 36 month, samples allowing you to learn about maturing cheese, so educational as well as gastronomic. The fruit, vegetables and meat are of the highest standard and not too highly priced considering it is in London. The staff serving are very knowledgeable, especially the lovely lady on the stall selling the amazing array of mushrooms. It is fascinating to watch the hand carving of hams. I could wander round this market for hours and spend a fortune, perhaps it is good that I don't liver closer!||February 12, 2014
Jimmy T||40||We love this place, the vibe, the food, the people!!! You can find a very large offer of food from independent companies that sell quality products. Mammoth coffee-house is a must visit. I recommend to go on Saturdays midday (as it gets very busy, good vibe) and skip the breakfast to indulge yourself in the good variety of food offer here.||February 12, 2014
Nikos T||50||I found this place thanks to Trip Advisor so I'm paying it forward I guess.If you're looking for a fun walk around excellent food stalls, some excellent lunch and dessert this is your place. Just a short walk from the Tower Bridge is conveniently located too.I wish I had more than one stomachs, but I did the Brandizo chorizo roll which was excellent. Mammoth coffee's line was too long but it's good I guess as it forced me to get a giant brownie and unfortunately I don't remember the name. But it's in a bakery stall that's right in the middle of everything you can't miss it and the brownie sizes are what normal people would consider like two brownies. But you can handle it. :)||February 11, 2014
Lg47||50||What a great market, we were told to visit by a gentleman we got talking to whilst having a coffee when we were going to visit the "Shard", the market is only about a 5 minute walk from London Bridge station and it's well worth a visit.Great history and wonderful food to either buy, eat or just taste!The architecture takes you back to how markets looked in yesteryear with the trains rumbling overhead and the sellers shouting their wares just wander around and soak up the atmosphere and charm of this lovely old market.||February 10, 2014
Lesley_P_C||50||We went to the market last Friday and Saturday. It was less busy Friday, absolutely packed on Saturday. If you can only go for one day try Friday it’s a little less busy so easier to get round and all the stalls are open. It has an amazing array of foods to try and to buy, so much more than is readily available here in the north east. I do feel that some of the prices are a little hiked up because of its reputation but the quality of everything that I bought or sampled was excellent. I can’t wait to go again but take a big case to get it all home because if you a devoted foodie like me you can get a bit carried away oops!||February 10, 2014
Joanna Z||50||I spent almost whole day in Borough Market ,together with my partner and friends. My friend had her birthday that day and we thought it would be a great idea celebrate it at Borough Market. She is a big fun of BM for years and food lover. So it was amazing day for us. It is a gorgeous place. You can try,you can buy,you can smell any food you like. You can find porcini from Tuscany, all sort of french sausages, milk straight from a cow, any fish you want,seafood so fresh,lemons from Amalfi coast, bread- fresh baked,and thousands more.... You can try paella,indian curry,eat delicious cheese sandwich and you can walk in between stalks with glass of Prosecco. It is a piece of heaven in central London.||February 10, 2014
morselover||40||It is over priced but don't feel guilty about trying everything. Many stalls are helpful and knowledgeable and you don't have to but the £25 bottle of balsamic vinegar. I loved the Indian food, and the Lebanese food - but go there for the experience rather than to buy your lunch.If, like me, you have a special food requirement (I am lactose intolerant) the you will find some fabulous foods. For a price||February 9, 2014
William C||50||Having been here for centuries, Borough Market is a glimpse of how London once looked, smelled and sounded. A fantastic variety of meat, fish, vegetables, bread, cheese, sweetmeats, etc. Take your pick from dozens of take-away stalls and go sit on one of the benches by the marvellous Southwark Cathedral.Saturday is heaving (not the place for a buggy) and almost impossible to find somewhere to sit down, it's much nicer during the week. Filled with character and charm and reminiscent of dimly lit old London films (trains even rumble overhead to add to the atmosphere), Starbucks and wagamama etc are no doubt knocking on the door, but let's hope this market continues as it is and doesn't suffer the same fate as other markets, such as Spitalfields which is now crammed with fashion and media types at the weekends and stalls full of overpriced 'craft'.||February 9, 2014
lullyn||50||Whether you're a foodie or just like good markets, take time to come here. I've been going to London for years, overnights and one day visits, and never heard of it before. It has something for everyone, from cheese, fresh pasta and oils to butchers, mushroom pate and utensils. You need good footwear and patience, as it gets very busy, but there is plenty to try and buy.||February 9, 2014
wollew672||50||The only problem (as a tourist/ visitor ) is NOT to forget that you do not live in London and there is no point in filling up your hotelroom minibar fridge with delicious cheese , fruit ,meat , vegetables ...... it is just better to eat on the spot . A "must visit " ....||February 9, 2014
Hilly J||50||Came over for an hour each side of the Wales/Ireland 6Nations game we watched in the pub on the corner. The market is better than any other retail food place we have ever been to in the UK. EvEn though it was a blustery very wet February Saturday afternoon, the market was packed, the stalls were piled high and selling fast, the benign interested spirit of the people of all ages was uplifting and the selection of food sublime refreshing and seductive. Some but not too much ready food from a selection of natural to heavily spiced Turkish teas through a wide range of Normandie produce and a thousand more choices. The regular thundering of the overground railway above us, the Cathedral bells, occasional emergency sirens from the busy road to the east and the happy buzz of all those in the market. Everything is here. Barely two hundred metres from the river, right beside the Cathedral and three or more very good pubs, less than five minutes slow walk from the tube and London Bridge Station. It's a delightful busy intersection of lives. Highly recommended. We come back and back.||February 9, 2014
Limeri||40||this place is a foodies paradise , check out the ginger pig butchers for a dazzling array of meats , i bought a selection of there sausages , get in early as i did its clearly signposted gfrom london bridge station so hard to miss , theres a wicked spanish deli shop complete with chorizo rolls , everything looks amazing plenty to eat , nice bars nearby , theres a no dogs policy here but i only noticed the stickers on my way out , i hit here just gone 930 am , nice and sedate but by 1015 it was coming v much to life , have a coffee under the bridge across from the globe pub and soak in the views and bustle , be aware that this place is expensive ,even the snacks arent cheap but worth a visit none the less !!!||February 9, 2014
Anna-j-m-family||50||Street food heaven. Artisan yummies. Ate pad Thai. 9 year old ate box of curry £3! Smells good. Mulled wine was fabulous. Some things are expensive. But my goodness it's good. Clouded on a Saturday. And not enough bins. ||February 8, 2014
arlei918||40||As I know, this old market has been there since 1014. We visited this market in a sunny day. You can find a variety of local food and products there. We had tried different food and drinks. I had forgot their names. But I have the photos. You can enjoy the sun and food by sitting on the chairs surround the stalls. It is also good for people-watching. I greatly recommend this place!||February 6, 2014
Lynsey F||50||As a newbie to London, I have been keen to explore and friends told me about this market in Borough. What a fascinating and fun experience! The food stalls are just endless with a big variety in produce. There was a great buzz about the place and the restaurants inside reflect the atmosphere. I went to a restaurant called Roast, and that was excellent||February 6, 2014
italiansinchicago||50||It was my first time but I've been stucked at this marked! You can find very good quality food and special food that I've never seen elsewhere.. There's food from every part of the world! I've been tryibg duck and I loved it! ||February 4, 2014
AvidTraveler12||40||Located by the River Thames and close to the Shard is the centuries old Borough Market which is also by Southwark Cathedral.The market is full of stalls selling weird and wonderful food to either eat now or take away. Dozens of pubs, cafe's and restaurants are either located within the market area or close by. It is a great place to people watch and has a great atmosphere.||February 3, 2014
JessieB924||50||Came to Borough market after visiting the Shard. As soon as we entered it was just brilliant. There are people everywhere and the hustle and bustle is amazing. There are too many food stalls to choose from and you are not spoilt for choice. The food is absolutely unreal and the atmosphere is awesome. Reasonably priced stalls and great to see locals buying their groceries here too. Near by pubs are equally as good. Quaint pub called the globe just outside. Busy and exciting place. You MUST go!||February 2, 2014
Extraveltrade||50||I had heard about this place from my other half. Do make the effort to go. It is just below London Bridge Rail station and just a one minute walk from London Bridge Underground.If you're expecting Eastenders, forget it !! If you are looking for exotic meats, more Balsamic Vinegar and Olive Oil then you can throw a stick at, your are in for a gastronomic delight. You name it, exotic cheeses, beers, breads, meats, sea food plus piles and piles of well presented veggies. Cheap ? No ! Quality Yes! (Ok so its a bit Ok Yah Joules 'City/Country set'. Who goes shopping at a market and takes their Roller ? but don't let that put you off. And if Tarquin trod on my foot one more time there would have been trouble)Don't eat before you go ! There are lots of very nice eateries nearby, or things to buy on the stalls. Nearby is the Vinopolis wine museum, but alas time was against me. Also don't miss the adjacent German Deli for any teutonic expats missing food from home. (They also have a stall in the markets which my German other half cleaned out of bread )||February 2, 2014
joyce018||40||It was such a find,we went back a second time. The pulled pork, the salt beef, the cheese stand, the Monmouth coffee, all an above average standard. It was especially good as we had signed up for a Harry Potter walking tour of the sites used in the films and the meeting place was just outside the same London Bridge stop on the Tube.||February 1, 2014
Mjwinkusa||40||If you enjoy a lively market scene with tempting taste treats look no further. From seafood paella to duck confit to the freshest homemade empanadas this side of the pond this market has it all and much much more. The first couple of times friends and I visited was on a Thursday - and in wintertime that means you pretty much have the market to yourselves and THAT is the way to see it in my view. Saturday, even on a cool winter's day, is a circus! Tourists flock to take smartphone pictures of every imaginable stand. "Look at that giant squid! Did you ever?" If you've ever been caught in rush hour on the tube you know what I'm talking about. Of course, if you simple LOVE the crush of humanity then by all means go on Saturday. But do go to this market as it is quite unique and well worth the trip.||February 1, 2014
MargaretMag||50||The market opens at 10 am and close around 6pm. We went to the market specially for oyster and man!!!! Worth the trip. There are many things to eat here so do come with an empty stomach. ||January 31, 2014
Valerio F||50||it is not just about food, or about a market. It's a place where you see and taste things you didn't even know they existed, or thought they existed in another era... they have everything, and it doesn't cost much. The real problem is that you can't make up your mind, there is not just one or two things you want to try, and then your wife wants to try other thins, and your children too. Fortunately it is not expensive. real pleasure.||January 31, 2014
DEMom19707||50||This historic market has it all - open air and covered shops a plenty. I defy anyone to go there and not find something they don't like (or love!) Wish we had been there when full market was open. Also go with cash in your pocket as not everyone takes credit.||January 30, 2014
bcmpqn||50||The food fair of food fairs. Very crowded but a must if you visit London. Food was excellent. We went on a Saturday. Probably accounts for the heavy crowds. Suggest not eating breakfast and then going for a fun lunch.||January 28, 2014
BradJill||40||The Borough Markets in Southwark is probably the best food market in London. Here you can find a wide selection of high quality British and European foods and many delicious foods to try. The market is a true - foodies delight, a place that food lovers should consider making time for during trips to London. At the Borough Markets, you can see and buy all manner of fresh produce, prepared food and dishes, cooked foods or stop at one of the cafes, restaurants and coffee shops setup around the market. We found some nice dry sausages, French cheeses, breads, olives and baklava during our last visit and will no doubt, return to the Borough Markets during future trips to London to pick up more food selections. We have also enjoyed very good breakfast food at Maria's Market Cafe in the middle of the Borough Markets and are fans of the Monmouth Coffee Shop and Robat 1745, for excellent hot chocolate drinks, at the marketplace. In the end, the Borough Markets is a very good place to visit, take pictures and to try some nice foods in London. You can find detailed information about the market, maps, information about its various traders and available food stalls on the Borough Market Website.||January 27, 2014
Jooaan||50||We heard of Borough market from our daughter and decided to seek it whilst on a short break to London.Luckily we were on our way to Liverpool St. Station so were able to stock up on some goodies before going home!The choice of cheese, bread, oils, veg and the samples to taste were great but the fish stall had to be my favourite......freshly cooked scallops were on offer for £5, beautifully cooked and served with bacon and stir fry veg....yum.A must for food lovers!||January 27, 2014
Airgon||40||Absolutely incredible food stuffs some I had forgotten about from my childhood, especially proper licorice sticks. ||January 27, 2014
Goannas||40||Plenty of prepared foods and drinks to satisfy you while you're there, and loads of cheeses, small goods, preserves (chutneys etc) as well as fresh produce.Some of it is a bit pricey, but everything we bought was delicious.||January 26, 2014
stephany1979||50||Having been here with family friends and children. This place is awesome in every ways. Food fantastic abd a great dayout. If you love food come here||January 26, 2014
Lulu85715||50||I knew nothing about this place and walked by on a Friday afternoon on the way to Tate Modern. What a nice surprise! It looked to me like a farmer's market, then I read it is London's favorite goodie market. It was not busy when I was there, and I heard it would be very busy on Saturdays.||January 26, 2014
Josh G||50||There are lots of 'markets' in London, this one is exceptionally clean and a great attraction. It is filled with all kinds of foods. Vendors give out samples, locals buy groceries, there are wines, cheeses, chocolates, deserts, and all kinds of other things to eat while your there or bring back for later. Also there are several pubs nearby to stop in after. It is also right next to the Tower Bridge so walk across also.||January 26, 2014
CindyK82||50||I highly recommend spending some time wandering around this market. There are so many delicious eats to try, from fresh squeezed juices, cured meats, fresh fish, baked goods and many other interesting things.||January 25, 2014
LizH809||50||I love food, more accuratly I love quality food, and this place does have it all. If you are into good quality food this is the place for you. The only warning I will come with if you are traveling from abroard and do not have a kitchen were you are staying and you are into great food... you may end up crying! I was so frustrated over so much goodies which I can not bring with me back home and make a splendid meal of... I ended up tasting, eating and stocking up on great teas, herbs, spices and some truffle... and dreaming of having a kitchen nearby!||January 25, 2014
Rudoni||50||If you are sightseeing or just want a bite to eat, you can't go wrong visiting this fun, buzzy place. Plenty of fresh food sellers and hot food to eat. The little spanish pasties were amazing as was the cheese bread sticks. So much to see, eat and drink. Great for some London street photography too. Love it.||January 25, 2014
8pairs||50||This market is a foodies paradise! So many different food stalls. It was absolutely heaving on the Saturday we visited. I have never seen such a crowded market. It was raining lightly so there was competition to stay under the roof line and out of the rain. We bought turkish delight, artisan bread, fresh juice, mulled wine, an Autumn burger (delicious!), sausages, bacon, cheese, raspberries! Thankfully, this was the first day of a week long stay in an apartment and our pantry was very well stocked as a result!||January 23, 2014
GeeJayEye||50||Crowded and fun. Great selection of food and eating opportunities. Try a sandwich or raclette on the Kappacasein stall.||January 23, 2014
fitzgeraldronan||50||a great morning activity. go early and take your time, lots to see, tastes and eat. Walk slowly, talk to the vendors, they are more than willing to explain everything, fantastic! ||January 23, 2014
Nickralph||50||You must see this if you do nothing else. Really worthwhile and good value too. Got everything here (food and drink).||January 22, 2014
Peter H||30||Looks very nice and has a lot of small exciting stalls where a lot of stuff can be bought. They also had some samples to try of cakes, bread etc. Unfortunately most of the place was closed when we were there, so it may be better to do a little extra research into when everything is open.We tried the PieMinister pie which was pretty good :)||January 21, 2014
kevinyhli||50||This is a lovely place to walk around and experience some of the best and most affordable food that London has to offer. I had the best fish and chips here, and the duck sandwich here (with a glass of mulled wine in winter) is to die for.Lots of really great fresh produce, meat, cheese, seafood - you name it. Allow for plenty of time and an empty stomach to sample all the great food that is available at this place.||January 20, 2014
Robert L||50||This was a very busy market. It reminded me of Pike Street Maket in Seattle, Washington. I had some of the best summer sausage here. The cheeses were excellent. Our British friends who brought us here said that many restaurants source their produce at Borough Market. There were tons of locals shopping here. We ate a restaurant close by that was covered with multiple brightly colored umbrellas. I loved this. Such a cool area. This is where I got to experience Pimm's punch. I found a nearby liquor store and bought a bottle to bring home.||January 19, 2014
BILLYazid||50||if you are not strapped for time, visiting a London market is a good experience and Borough market is one of the best. Find out from their website what's available for the day because the market has special days for antiques, etc etc in addtion to its normal market produce. In the market there are numerous stores and stalls selling foods from cheeses to freshly shucked oysters to breads. You can go around tasting the samples. There are also many restaurants in the vicinity. We tried the "Fish Restaurant". Its a large restaurant at the side of the market. The fish and chips was very good, the portion quite large. In spite of the large crowd in the restaurant, the service was very fast and friendly.||January 18, 2014
Barry H||50||Fresh produce, meat, fish, vegetables in profusion with lots of opportunities to taste, hot and cold. Toast, the restaurant above, gives a great view and provides just a coffee, a drink or a full meal in up market surroundings. My Normandy coffee, with calvados and double cream, negated the wind chill easily. Alsao very near the Shard if you like High Rise monuments.||January 18, 2014
313mathewb||50||Every time I am in London I have to go ! Foodies heaven! Try the curry mid market or the duck roll at the French booth or the sausages at broods. It really doesn't matter everything is amazing ! Don't forget to check out Neil's yard (cheese, dairy shop) just outside the entrance. Most vendors will offer a sample of items for free so it's great place to familiarize yourself with all sorts of food . Great mixing bowl of cuisine from all over the world!do yourself a favor and just go!||January 17, 2014
mariamboots||50||Absolutely loved borough markets. So many food options making it easy to roam and try lots! There are two sections basically split into savoury/sweets. Many people even in the middle of the week but the store vendors are very friendly and the crowd is easy to put up with. Must try the chorizo roll, strawberry tarts and the iced earl grey tea! Would definitely return when i'm in London again.||January 15, 2014
WDPEaK02||50||What a day, it was fantastic to visit the borough market again this week. We spent more than half a day looking, sampling and buying top food and drinks, and dare I say it with fun, we never felt threatened once, a very friendly market to visit.||January 14, 2014
Tim330||50||I love dropping in on Borough market while in London. It can get very busy as the day goes on, but get in there by about 9am and you can see everything with ease. Fantastic smells, gorgeous artisan breads and bakery, fish, cheeses, wines, and glorious displays of all manner of vegetables. Just stand in the middle and inhale...Mmmmm!||January 12, 2014
GEC833||50||I will never get tired of visiting Borough Market even if I'm not a London resident anymore! This adorable market offers a variety of things to purchase. Whether you are on your lunch break and need something easy and scrumptious to nibble on or you want to do your grocery shopping, this is the place to be! The only thing negative is managing to decide which stall to actually buy something from! I dare say that a favorite is "The Exotic Meat Company", even if I know I might be criticized by some of you, and the stall with the raclette that melts cheese! If you don't want to do any shopping, you still should visit as the market offers a lot of photographic opportunities and there is no way you will witness any interaction that doesn't include smiles! Enjoy!||January 12, 2014
Lisa E||50||Highly recommended if you have ANY interest in food. Lovely oysters, great meat and loads of stuff to try, buy and browse. Exciting part of London. If visiting go see the surrounding streets as well. REALLY GOOD||January 12, 2014
chobhamlass||50||In the sunshine, with The Shard towering above it against a blue sky, fabulous and fascinating foodie heaven! Purchasing isn't cheap of course but looking, tasting and hanging out doesn't cost. Lovely.||January 11, 2014
FrequentTripster||50||This is a terrific market with a good mix of fresh and prepared foods artfully displayed. Local and international offerings. Go hungry||January 11, 2014
Annie19641971||50||Borough Market continues to be such a great experience when you visit. I used to be lucky enough to walk through it every night on my way home from work but it has been some years since then. We went twice shortly before Christmas - and it seems to have got even better. Fantastic food (that you can try before you buy), great stalls of all types and lots of other things to see and do. This is a London "Must-see", for all foodies especially, and a landmark that needs to be kept.||January 11, 2014
yanivsteinfeld||50||heaven for food lovers. all kind of sausages, cheese, bakes and great dishes. you can try a lot before you buy. great beers and ciders...i recommend the duck in the store between the two markets or the salted pork sandwitch||January 10, 2014
hellovng||50||It is like a food heaven! It has everything packed in this place: cheese, spices, fresh fruits, pasta, delicious beef burger, hot and tasty mulled wine! It was a bad choice that we had plans for dinner after our visit, else we could've had our filled at the market! So yeah, go with an empty stomach!||January 10, 2014
EastBostonGuy||50||So many great things to sample. You must try the raclette. This place makes you understand why London is such a world class city. ||January 9, 2014
515MikeA||40||we love coming hear to shop and get the market feel ..we usually do a cook-a-thone after we visit get there early it does get very busy .we usually go up for breakfast , then but parma ham ,mozzaella. olive oil, meet, fish. asian food , Comte cheese , drink the hot coch and have to much to carry home ..warning it is expensive||January 8, 2014
Hoppo369||50||The smells and sights of Borough Market - wow - where to look first was our dilemma ? Fantastic stalls, with amazing food, plenty of 'tasters' on offer to tempt us to buy. Great choice of food and drink , fruit and vegetables, fresh bread to die for and the home made brownies were amazing. Well worth a visit||January 7, 2014
casmarti||50||If you are looking for fresh Italian buffalo mozarella or Parma ham sliced wafer thin, blue foot or hedgehog mushrooms imported from French forests, cheese from every corner of Europe, numerous varieties of Balsamic vinegar, olive oil or olives, a vast range of home-made pies, Turkish Delight from Istanbul, hand-made chocolates, fish and shell fish from Cornwall or Scotland, live lobsters, fruit and veg both familiar and unfamiliar, a stall selling every kind of game you can imagine, including (rather bizarrely) a whole small Japanese deer, wine merchants, coffee importers, breads of every size shape and flavour and a huge variety of ready to eat foods, then this is the market for you!!! Borough Market is well worth a visit if you want to buy some speciality foods or just go to browse and eat there – there is plenty of choice.It is, of course, a far cry from the street market that used to be there and I'm sure the original food vendors would be turning in their graves but it is a great market nonetheless. If you are a visitor to the area, pop round the corner and have a look at the replica 16th century sailing ship the Golden Hinde II and have a pint in the Thames-side pub just alongside or wander into Southwark Cathedral right next door. Also in the immediate area are the Shard and the site of one of London's oldest prisons - The Clink. A super way to spend a morning - but beware of the opening hours - it is not open every day.||January 7, 2014
gzau||50||We visited Borough market twice during our Christmas trip to get some good food. There is a great selection of vendors including butcher, fruit stands, cheese shop, spices, jams, cakes... I got some great aged English cheese, prosciutto Daniela, bread, apples and chocolate. We liked it so much that we went back to buy good for our teams Atlantic flight. It does stay closing down around 4pm so go earlier||January 6, 2014
TravelproGroup||40||LOVED Borough Market and the surrounding food stands. Our whole family had a great time snacking and shopping the unique foods. A great alternative to going out for lunch. Everyone can grab a few bites of what they enjoy....||January 5, 2014
Michibaby2013||50||I have been to eat in this market a couple of times, always when the rain was pouring big time but it didn't manage to spoil the great atmosphere you can breath in here.I normally have a glass of rose' as aperitif, it is served in plastic flutes not to spoil the enjoyment of sipping good wine from a plastic cup, and it works!The stalls are fantastic, even if you do not want to eat just looking at them makes you feel you want to try the delicious food.Bread is really good, I have tried paella which is very nice and good value at 6 pounds, I have also tried salted beef sandwich which was very good. Cakes are also wonderful!It is definitely a place to visit in London.||January 4, 2014
SunnyWestKelowna||50||Always looking for great food - Borough market doesn't disappoint. Spent a few hours wandering the stalls and enjoying the food and the atmosphere. If you like food, this is a great stop.||January 4, 2014
cxsmic||50||Borough Market has a very good mix of stalls selling different kinds of food! There's Asian food, pastries & desserts, fresh produce, meats and cheeses. There is surely something for everyone and the food is also pretty affordable. Merchants were very friendly and funny too. The market gets lively from 12-2pm but quietens down after 3pm. I highly recommend the salted caramel fudge from one of the stalls!! Will be back for more!||January 4, 2014
mindoslu||50||I've made it to Borough Market 3 times in one week, we spant in London. It is a great place to eat and shop. I was cooking the New Year's Eve dinner so I got most of the ingredients from there. I highly recommend Applebee's for fresh seafood shop acrossf rom the market. The bread stand is fabulous, we got loaves and rosemary breadsticks, both were delicious. We got variety of cheeses and exquisite chorizo and rosemary tuffle sausages with lamb slices tasted better than serrano ham. There's so much to taste and one visit is not enough. Southwark area is also home for Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe Theater, Southwark Cathedral. It is a nice stroll after you visit the market. It is one of my favorite areas in London.||January 3, 2014
Rossonwye63||50||Great fun, stallholders happy to let you taste anything and everything and a great place to visit for pre Christmas ideas in the food department. Enjoyed the atmosphere and soaked up the knowledge about the food on display from the stallholders who do know their stuff. We called in at Southwark Cathedral too during a pre carol service rehearsal which complimented a perfect Christmas outing. This market it easy to find from London Bridge Tube Station and well worth a visit particularly if you want to see The Shard. For foodie lovers, you wont be disappointed - vaste selection of top quality cheeses, meat, mushrooms, chocolate, virgin olive oil ... spoilt for choice.||December 30, 2013
JoNorwich||50||I love Borough Market, such a great place to try lots of new and exciting things to eat. the stall holders are happy for your to try to your hearts content, they will help you with ingredients etc, they can tell you the origins of the products if you ask. it's tucked away at the back of London Bridge station so you have to check the map if you've never been before but well worth a look. make sure you have plenty of time to visit as it can get very crowded especially on Saturdays, I would suggest at least 3 hours to have a proper look at all the stalls and fill your tum! Make sure you take the time to have a look around the area too, the Golden Hind is just around the corner and the Shard is at the end of the street, Borough High street is just as vibrant and exciting too. I wouldn't take anyone less then the age of 10 due to the crowds but other wise I always feel its a safe environment to be in.||December 29, 2013
XenaSfe||30||Stall sales people seem world weary and a little on the mean spirited side (at the coffee shop and at the bacon sandwich shop). The bacon sandwich is good but snotty service.||December 29, 2013
kathrynNorthWales||50||Travel to London Bridge tube station and you will be greeted by "the Shard".there is a viewing gallery and its pretty impressive. A visit to Borough Market is a must. When I browsed through there was a fantastic array of stalls selling a myriad of different foods. Vast varieties of wild mushrooms, oysters, colourful fruit and vegetables, chocolates, meats, fish and patisserie. Heaven for foodies. I bought gorgeous german style cheesecake. Yum.||December 29, 2013
Empanada M||50||My idea of heaven is an endless Borough Market where every vendor has free samples and they don’t judge you for taking more than one, instead they encourage it! The food will be free, and it will have no caloric value, and you'll never feel full so you can just keep on eating, and eating, and eating. #FatGirlProblemsThe Best Prepared Meal Item: Thai Green Curry Paella with Chicken & Seafood over Rice. The meat is tender and flavorful and the sauce is divine!The Best Cheese: The Borough Cheese Company’s 15 mo. aged ComteThe Best Exotic Item for Purchase: Tartufaia Truffles’ White Truffle Honey (I put this stuff on everything!)The Best Eat at Home Purchase: West Country PreservesI bought the Spicy Gooseberry with Cumin Seeds, which is more savory than sweet. It pairs well with chicken and meat, but also toast if your taste buds are like mine! I also bought one of the Ginger Curds, which is a sweetened yet naturally spicy spread that pairs lovely with toast and desserts.||December 28, 2013
Mark H||50||The new layout is superb. Everything you need is here from Olive oils, cheese,meats, and don't forget to buy a Borough Market accessory!||December 27, 2013
Francisca M||40||I went there for a quick visit and I was amazed! It has all kinds of food, including things I didn't expect to find there. It is easily accessible and makes me want to live in London to be able to go there to do my daily shopping! You should visit, even if you don't have much time||December 26, 2013
jeffb293||50||There are lots of markets, big and small, throughout London, but Borough Market is my favorite. I like to walk there, starting at St. Paul's Cathedral, crossing the Millenium Bridge, cutting through the Tate Modern and then following the Thames to the market. There are tons of great artisanal foods there, many offering delicious samples. I always like to stop at Maria's Market Cafe for breakfast and a hot cocoa when going on Saturday mornings. The immediate area is great, too, with great restaurants and pubs like The Market Porter and The Rake.||December 26, 2013
MrB66||50||This is a wonderful p[lace to go to shop or browse for food, and to a lesser degree for other things. Wide variety of cheeses, spices etc. as well as delightful and tasty lunches. It is very busy but great atmosphere.||December 26, 2013
Diana C||50||This market is great, full to bursting with passionate artisan producers selling top quality treats and plenty of store cupboard staples. Lots of hot food to eat while you browse. It is a very popular place to visit, and yes it gets crowded, just keep your eyes open, be considerate to those around you and keep moving! Enjoy!! ||December 24, 2013
Steve J||50||My friend and I visited here on a Sunday afternoon after having ate a little bit earlier, boy was that a mistake.The hustle and bustle is fantastic and such a pleasure to be in a place with such a rich variety of different foods to buy.The food looked truly fantastic, even not being hungry we still brought some items for later. I dread to think what I would have eaten if I had been there for a lunch, definitely a must!||December 24, 2013
terry w||40||Borough Market is a lovely market that reminded me of Greenwich market. There are mainly food stalls selling food of all different varieties and it's smells and colours are wonderful. There is also cheeky little cider stall which sold scrumpy and I could not resist. Well worth a visit and is a pleasant walk along the southbank of the Thames||December 24, 2013
Louise O||40||It was raining but this market is about 95% under over. There is a wide range of cured meats, seafood, fruit, veg,cheese, specialty foods as well as cakes, breads, sweets and honeys. All foods we tested were thoroughly delicious and what assists is that many stalls have samples so you can test some of the products before you buy. These were friendly stall owners and even when really crowded you could still easily purchase what you wanted,My daughter bought a triple shot coffee at a cart down the back of the market and it was perfect. No bitterness. This is rare and this is just one demonstration so these stall people really know food and drink.If you love eating you will like this place!||December 21, 2013
RealBobbyDazzler||50||Whether you are visiting London or you live close by, Borough Market is a must visit.I am fortunate to live about a 5 minute walk away and would recommend getting there around 11.30am ahead of it getting crazily busy. Today was an exception as we are approaching Christmas and it was busy early on with a great atmosphere.The sites, smells and samples will get you tasting and inevitably purchasing various ingredients to compliment your normal weekly shop!||December 21, 2013
Traveller_Green037||50||Start out early so you can actually move around the Market and make a reservation at The Roast first to have breakfast. The Roast is great as well as always great service. Remember to sample things you never have tried and just enjoy. You can get a cup of spiced wine or cider and wander around the great place.This is a treasure!||December 21, 2013
dawn34273||50||kangaroo burgers,purple sprouts,mushroom pate,cheeses, wines and lots and lots of samples...fun even when its not Christmas.||December 21, 2013
RADCTurton||50||We visited Borough Market this December while on a short break to the capital. It is atmospheric of the old markets that used to dwell in every town in the country but now sadly replaced by the food giants, Tesco, Asda etc. You will find a huge selection of stalls selling an eclectic mix of both local staples and food from Europe and beyond. If you like cheese then you should be in heaven.Give it a visit and see what we are all missing these days while trudging round the hypermarkets.||December 18, 2013
Noafie||50||Whether you're a foodie or just a passer-by, Borough Market has a little bit of everything for a little bit of everyone. There are of course seasonal specialities, but you can be sure that you will always be able to grab a good bite. The Salt beef sandwiches are a must-try, so are the various pastry choices.||December 18, 2013
PM551H||50||What a fantastic place. Even with hordes of christmas shoppers there is something special about Borough Market. There are stalls catering for every taste and many of them allow you to sample their goods before you buy. Walking around with mulled wine just tops the whole experience off…If you are a foodie you will love it.||December 17, 2013
stevenandmandy||50||The range of produce available here has led us to forget about booking a hotel for our next London trip and instead look for self catering accommodation! Add to all the fresh produce the variety of bars and eateries, you could probably spend a whole week on holiday in the market and not get bored!||December 16, 2013
Dpln||50||We went up on a sat morn and got there by half 9. It wasn't too busy at this time and we were able to move around freely. We are a family of foodies so I did most of my Xmas shopping here, you really will find something for everyone as the variety is vast. It's also in a great position for being able to mooch along the south bank. I would highly recommend this place. ||December 16, 2013
melmoff||50||Difficult to describe this experience as there is so much to do for all ages, budgets etc. This is a great attraction for both visitors and locals with a huge variety of stalls and things to both view and buy. The atmosphere is fantastic and this is not your run of the mill tourist spot, but a working breathing historic market, serving the local and fine food communities. Close to tube station and other attractions in the Bankside area.||December 16, 2013
i_like_travel78||50||This old favourite is not somewhere I have had the chance to visit before, so on my return to the mother country I made a point if doing it. It's a great little place and whilst it was fully open on the day I visited (full market is Thursday, Friday and Saturday) we thoroughly enjoyed the food stalls and even took some pie minister pies home for our tea!! Great little different stalls too :)Go visit!!!||December 15, 2013
lapetitelucette||50||I go to Borough Market for the items below weekly:Delicious seafood paella with massive prawns/muscles and grilled chorizoExcellent bratwurst with sauerkraut Fabulous cheese stands (my favourite is Une Normande A Londres) Freshly baked goodiesIn the times leading to Christmas, the place is beautifully and tastefully decorated. It does get extremely crowded even in the coldest days. So be sensible and stow your valuables away to make sure no undesirables take advantage of the coziness. I truly believe there's something for everyone in the Borough Market even for the fussiest of us. Even if you don't want to buy anything, it's still so much fun to walk around and people-watch!||December 13, 2013
Huntages||50||Loved the great variety of culinary delights but be advised it will be busy on weekends. Not a good idea to visit if you're planning a large lunch due to the great number of treats and tasters!! Nonetheless an absolute must!||December 10, 2013
Ngaire E||50||Went here on a recent trip to London, great place to browse the different stalls, food from everywhere. Good fresh veg,fish and meat. Would have bought more if going that day but didn't have anywhere to store so didn't. Recommend to leave quite a few hours to go round we went on a Friday so wasn't so busy but expect Saturday would be.||December 9, 2013
AnnaNLCH||40||Go when you're hungry! This is a great food market, lots of different kind of foods. You can easily walk here from the Tower Bridge, walking along the side of the river.||December 9, 2013
Penjen54||50||What an amazing place - bigger that I expected and there has to be a food choice for everyone. A assault on the senses with every sort of fresh ingredients from hand made chocolates and sweets, to full blown prepared delicious meals. Sorry to say we only had time for lunch there - I will be back! We had the advantage of seeing it decorated for Christmas - it looked beautiful. If in this part of London it is a must do!||December 8, 2013
Cheshirelass01||50||A visit is a must when in London. Fab unique food and atmosphere.Has been revamped since our last visit.Loads of different cheeses, meats, olive oils, vinegars & unique gifts.You will never leave empty handed!||December 8, 2013
Memphis_piranha||50||This is a foodie's paradise! It is not only a market to buy fresh ingredients, but has a vast assortment of prepared foods that one can enjoy there. There is ethnic food of all sorts and also sandwiches and British staples. There was a mead tasting and cider. My only regret is that I didn't check out the whole place before I ate.||December 8, 2013
Venusalberta33||50||This on one of the London experiences I enjoyed and would recommend for anyone. I stayed nearby and visited 3 times. It was buzzing with young people late on the Saturday and had a wonderful fun vibe. The stall of foods; wine, cheese, meats, pastries, breads, licorice are enticing. People were friendly; made me feel this is what I came to London to see.||December 7, 2013
DJC026||40||In November 2013 whilst in London, my girlfriend and I came across Borough Market, which was rather fortunate as we were looking for a place for lunch. The market can be located just a short walk from London Bridge station. Come out the front where they are selling the London Bridge Experience Tour and go left, across the road and down the stairs to go under the bridge / underpass and here you will find Borough Market.The entrance this way brought us passed a café that had set up an impressive (and huge) pan of meatballs and next to it paella. Being close to Christmas they were also selling mulled wine. This ended up being too much to resist and we had a bit of each for a reasonable amount of money and I have to say it was very good.From here we ventured into the market proper and there was an impressive array of market stalls. Sweets, cakes, Oriental food, roast hog, small gifts and the majority hand / home made at generally fair prices, especially if you buy the deals on offer. For those interested there was even a gluten free stall, so you could still enjoy the naughtier variants of food! It does get and was busy when we were there so it can be a bit slow getting around. If you are an easily frustrated person and / or impatient for others to get moving or out the way, it may be best to wait until a quieter time to visit.All in all this was a very pleasant little market and of the small amount of things we bought (all food) the quality was excellent. On top of that it doubled up as a great place for lunch, with a multitude of options to choose from depending on your mood and tastes.||December 6, 2013
Javier R||40||This place should be in every travel guide as a must visit. There is all kind of food. The food is great in all diferent kiosks and also there are restaurants and bars. Don't miss it. And don't go on a schedule so you can enjoy walking around.||December 5, 2013
chatthefoodie||50||If you enjoy eating any kind of food, then Borough Market is a most definite visit on your London itinerary. Easily accessible via the tube to London Bridge Station, Borough Market is a mind-blowing experience in food retailers all under one roof. Here, you get everything from fine imported cheese to multi-cultural favorites from Turkey and beyond.What I loved most about this particular market was the energy of both the buyers and the sellers. You think back to a traditional British market as depicted in novels and movies when vendors would holler out their menus or products for sale to attract customers, and you get Borough Market today. Situated in a restored high-ceiling market area, the layout is confusing at first but after awhile you forget about it as you wander from one delicious stall to the next. I saw a lot of people come not just to buy food, but to take in the whole electric local market experience. I did some prior homework before going so I knew which stalls to visit, but then I found so many more after getting there. It was a fun afternoon.If you visit only one market in London, Borough Market is it.||December 4, 2013
HermanK449||40||My wife and I went to the Borough Market for the second time. It was much quitter and we had time to walk around and browse a bit. We bought some spices and had coffee at a coffee shop around the corner from the Market.It was a nice visit and I can recommend it. The cheeses look divine and the street food scrumptious!||December 4, 2013
Frank M||40||If you like good food, a whole lot to choose from and a tapa's like idea, then Borough Market is the place to go. From all over the country people sell their food to a large crowd interested in what's on offer. You might choose indian, you might choose marrocan or simply a Brittish Pie. The quality is high, which is -admittingly- reflected in some prices, the taste is good and the choice is enormous. If you have your own cooking facilities then Borough Market offers a wide range of butchers, pie makers, greengrocers, breadmakers, etc. to have your pick. Definetly worth a visit. To be found near London Tower Bridge station (tube/rail), at walking distance from The Shard and closed on Sundays (!)||December 4, 2013
SteadyS||40||Unfortunately visited on a Tuesday when most of the market was closed but made the most of what was open which was the street food stalls. Marvellous pie, mash and gravy. Area had great atmosphere and we'll definately visit again next time we're in London but make sure we go on the right day next time !||December 4, 2013
MissHale||50||Was here last week and if I had a bigger wallet I would have bought myself poor yet very happy. This is a must in London; traditional English goods and everything your little heart could desire. If you are out looking for things to bring back with you to your country or as great gifts to others, this is the place. I was there on a Thursday and it was teeming with people, so be prepared for quite the run on the weekends.||December 3, 2013
mandkPenzance||50||An absolutely fantastic market. Such a food choice and oh what lovely, quality produce. It really is eating around the world if you could manage it!||December 2, 2013
levans64||50||having the opportunity to have a little taste of different foods enabled us to purchase lovely foods that we may not have otherwise purchased. Lovely fresh fruit and veg available. The atmosphere is buzzing and well worth a visit.||December 1, 2013
Curlywhurly||50||Well Borough Market doesn't come up when you search things to do in London, while I want people to know about this fantastic market part of me wants it kept a secret . Charming market with carts and stalls and fabulous displays of cheeses, meat, fishes, vegetables , flowers and so much more . Mulled wine available in the festive season and sangria available in the summer . The tube station is outside the entrance of the market were you will get a fantastic photo opportunity of the Shard the UK tallest building . Would definitely recommend a visit to this traditionally London market .||December 1, 2013
Simon G||40||We thought we'd go and grab some lunch during a recent visit to London, pre view from the Shard! This place is foodie heaven! Loads of places to grab a bite of pretty much anything (quality!) no fast food chains here! If you are in the area, get off at London Bridge and pop in! We certainly will be again! ||November 28, 2013
borderless_w||50||Love the energy of the place! Especially love:- Cheese tasting- Olive oil tasting - especially the white truffle olive oil - smells amazing!- Cheese raclette from Kappacasein Dairy (The cheese sandwich looks yummy too, will try that next time)- Wide variety - from french sea salt to fresh (uncooked) rabbit to organic flax seeds to hot fragrant specialty coffee; you'll be spoilt for choice!||November 25, 2013
jeans894||50||Well worth a visit the London Borough Market is somewhere you can taste different foods, cheeses, breads etc. You need time there to browse and maybe visit a restaurant or have a snack in a little pub. I guarantee you will go back again there is so much to see. There is an oyster bar which we did not have time for (too long spent in the little pub) but would love to go back. Short walk from London Bridge Station. A must on one of your London trips.||November 25, 2013
bernadettemnd||20||Yes food is interesting but is it worth the price? This food market is very expensive. If you are from Birmingham don't go here. Birmingham bullring market is cheaper with the same excitement. ||November 24, 2013
Charles M||50||The London Borough Market is a relatively little known "attraction." An array of carts, booths and displays of varied and absolutely fresh and delicious foods, from breads, to cheeses, to meet products to fresh produce. The variety is amazing and the prices are more than reasonable. Located not far from the London Eye, the market is truly a step back in time. A must visit.||November 23, 2013
1975Anna||40||I visited Borough Market one Friday in November and what an excellent experience! Although it was busy due to being lunch time it wasn't that bad as the queues were not too long. There is a vast array of stalls selling their wares, from fruit and vegetables, various meats, a mushroom stall and various drinks. There was also a great selection of stalls selling hot and cold food, all nationalities and some allowed tasters before buying! Well worth going to visit if you're in the London Bridge area of London.||November 23, 2013
Janice H||40||We visited today Saturday, 23 December. It was so busy there were times we could literally not move or we had to be simply carried along with the crowd. There is so much to eat,drink and see you need time to browse - this was difficult as people were getting impatient if you lingered at a stall. There is a lot of good quality produce, but go with stalls where the pricing is clearly marked. We started to buy some honey roast nuts. The guy is very quick to start shovelling them into a bag and his accent was hard to understand and he kept trying to push other stuff onto us. When our bag was weighed it came to £15! It wasn't much bigger than a bag you would buy in a supermarket of, say, honey roasted nuts. The prices were not shown. We said we didn't want them, the guy grumbled but we just walked off. This stall is a rip off but in general most places mark their prices. Make sure you ask if you are not sure. ||November 23, 2013
AJDDOD||50||This is an fantastic market & not to be missed. So much to see, buy & eat. It needs a good few hours to absorb the atmosphere & really enjoy. Do not eat before coming here as there is so much to sample.||November 23, 2013
Billythefish1||40||The market is a really great place to browse and buy. Lots of different stalls selling many different types of food. Plenty to see and browse. Pick up a sample and check on the cuisines. Something for everyone||November 21, 2013
Francisco_OM||40||On one of the market entrances there is a small stall selling amazing duck sandwiches.There is no way to miss it because usually the queue is big.Great treat!||November 18, 2013
Hollywright||40||If you like bustling markets and good varied food then borough market is worth a visit....you can find anything from snacks to a proper feeding in the market itself and it is so well located with restaurants, pubs and bars surrounding it that you will have a great time whether it is a passing visit or a full day out. My only gripe is because it is such a tourist destination now it is becoming very expensive and on Saturday it is uncomfortably busy....but I still love it!||November 17, 2013
TACOB0B||40||We visited Borough Market in November. It was very easy to find as it is right across the street from the London Bridge Tube stop. We arrived around 10am on a Saturday morning and there were several people shopping but it wasn't crowded but by 11am it was starting to get quite crowded. The first part of the market we entered was stall after stall of people selling hot food with everything from pastries to sausages on a stick. As you continue on through the market you come to the farmers market area with people selling fruits, vegetables, seafood, meats, and even hard to find spices. You also have several people selling gourmet items, cheeses, wine, and beer. This is a great place to stroll around out of the rain and it will get you out of the museums for a few hours. We would recommend.||November 17, 2013
sleepy2l||40||This street market is huge and has everything to awaken your sense of smell, sight, sound, taste and more! A delightful way to spend the morn or early afternoon on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday.Every ethnic group is recognized here and blended into one fantastic experience. Samples of cheeses, hard cider, candy, jams, meats, etc. are laid out to be sampled, savored and (hopefully) purchased. We took bagfuls back to our rented flat and enjoyed them! Especially liked the award winning meat pies, as these were some of the things we had not tasted before. This was the most diverse market places we have encountered in our travels and would recommend the experience to all tourists, as there is something here for everyone.||November 16, 2013
405LisaL||40||Beautifully presented food market..with many places to eat.We had a good value breakfast here surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the market, great atmosphere.Situated next to London Bridge tube station and just behind the Tate Modern and the Globe.||November 16, 2013
Toni H||50||Definitely my most preferred stopover or detour on my stroll at bankside between Millienium Bridge and Tower Bridge. Because here you can get on one hand delicious Fish & Chips, but on other hand also nice gifts or delicate ingredients for home.||November 14, 2013
jjjcLondon||50||A proper food market in the heart of London, with everything from a potato wholesaler to oysters, truffles and game. Most of the stalls offer tasters of their produce and the variety is very interesting. This is a great bet for lunch on the hoof, with many, many stalls selling hot meals to go from burgers, wraps, curries, paella, hot salt beef to oysters, game and cakes. A word of warning; it can be expensive (but where in London isnt), and can be very busy at the weekends - but i think this enhances the experience. Theres a proper london caf in the middle, run by proper London ladies for cheap for honest food (i think the stall holders go here for tea and bacon rolls). In the summer, we scoffed a kilo fresh Kent cherries (never tasted better) and a apple almond cake for lunch, washed down with prosecco by the glass! In the autumn, we had more cake and hand made ammeretti (heaevn). You can also sit in the ground of Southwark cathederal or pop into their lovely cafe to warm up if its cold. Definately worth the trip, a favourite place of mine in the capital. Go hungry to really enjoy! Great thing to do as a couple; brilliant with the kids||November 13, 2013
Sarah T||40||I thought it was awesome. We weren't intending to go here, but got lost trying to find London Bridge (ha). We were able to spend some time touring the Borough Market and looking at the many types of wares, from fresh meats and fish to cheeses and fruit to spices and dry goods. This market is huge, colorful, and offers many options for shopping or dining.||November 11, 2013
Philip S||40||Under the tracks to London Bridge Station nestles this wonderful market specialising in food both from Britain and further afield. As well as top quality (and sometimes pricey) produce to buy for your own kitchen there were many food outlets, offering the flavours and aromas of many different cuisines.If we lived closer this would be a regular haunt to close to the Thames. Don't forget to take a look at the adjacent cathedral.||November 10, 2013
TarnMark81||50||One of my favourite places to see in London and never disappoints. Go early as by lunchtime you cannot move. We love to mooch around soaking up the atmosphere and smells of the produce and hub bub going on. It's a terrific must see when in London, nowhere gives you a sense of London market at its best. The stalls are clean and well presented, the little shops in the side streets offer interesting stuff, from 'fabulous coffee' to remedies and potions... Quite pricey in general, but a must!||November 9, 2013
GEJP||40||London is a great place for food, and Borough market is one of the hubs. Its a interesting mix of cuisines, and food, but its over priced. Obviously its still enjoyable just for a wander, but on a weekend its packed so pick your timing||November 8, 2013
Stellayyl||40||A good place to start the day, walk around with a cup of coffee and pastry from the market. Not much else to praise about. This can be a starting point to walk either towards London Bridge or towards Shakespear's Globe Theatre/Tate Modern and past Millenium Bridge to St. Pauls' Cathedral.||November 6, 2013
manliosing||50||I´ve been sometimes at Borought Market and every visit is a surprise!Nice place for a food experience in London! Wide range of options!Lots of stalls selling very fresh products. Prices were okAmazing place, full of colors, scents, people from all over the world. Nice atmosphere!||November 5, 2013
metalheadrr3||50||Most of our trips to London are day trips and we spend them dotting around the city. We popped in here for the first time and absolutely loved it. Tons of great food stalls and eateries with great tasting and reasonably priced food. This is the perfect place to browse through to get some good food for lunch on the go. Absolutely loved the atmosphere as well.||November 4, 2013
ilikedetectives||50||If you are looking for the best food experience in London, this is the perfect place! There are all kinds of food and drinks from around the world that you can think of! (I didn't know there's something called "chocolate wine".) Most of the products sold here is organic, fresh, cheaper and more diverse (compared to grocery stores like Sainsbury and Tesco). People are very friendly! You can also get free samples from many stalls such as olive oil, bread, cookies, cheese, organic hand-made granola, paté, curry, etc. This is a great place to hangout with your friends, to shop, or just simply to discover new kinds of food and drinks!||November 3, 2013
samwei||50||Went to Borough market today. the atmosphere was nice and amazing. this is my third visits to the market. unfortunately, I still haven't got a chance to try to monmouth coffee and the fried scallops. there are lots of stalls selling homemade cheese and fresh vegs. I like the tasting experiences in the market. You can find your own taste before purchased. the traders are very helpful will answer all your questions about their product. However, I find that the seafood a little pricy there.If you drop off from the London Bridge tube station is a easy way to reach the Market.||November 2, 2013
timsmithmusic||40||An amazing place - so many different kinds of food and drink. Need to go again when the larder and fridge are emptier!Particularly impressed with the greengrocers' stalls - everything well displayed and prices very fair (especially for central London).||November 1, 2013
Kezzar53||50||Very busy but worth it! If you love tasting different cuisines it is the place to go! Great fresh produce sold by people who take the time to help you chose.I bought some cheese and bread which was divine and the staff took the time to help me chose exactly what I wanted. They will let you taste first too so you know you're buying something you like!If you're hungry buy a Boston burger from Boston Sausage. They are simply delicious. Quality sausage meat in a burger shape with red onion chutney and Stilton. I drool at the thought of it!||October 30, 2013
dizzyb3||40||I love wandering through here but the food is not cheap! However what you get is definitely good quality. Great to wander through while sipping a glass of prosecco!||October 29, 2013
MikeyJsy||50||Our sons had long been fans of Borough Market so having recovered from my trip up the Shard we went on to the market. What a fantastic place! All the stall holders were so friendly and helpful. There was so much on offer to taste and sample. There is something there for everyone's taste. We left with bags full of pickles, chutneys and pates. A real must be a sausage roll from the Ginger Pig stall. Never see so much meat in a sausage roll and not overpriced either. I have promised the wife we will return as we both enjoyed it so much. A real experience and something not to miss. One word of advice though do get there early before the crowds start.||October 28, 2013
dorleenl||50||Loved this small but really cool market, there is a little bit of everything from baked goods, meats(salame,prosciutto,fresh game), sandwiches,seafood, cheeses, juice bar, fruits and vegetables. We bought a great hot salame sandwich and cherry cheesecake, some prosciutto..........it was all so wonderful. There are also some restaurants in the area and clean bathrooms. We stopped here first, on the way to the Tower Bridge then after the museum ate our sandwich on a boat cruise.||October 27, 2013
1cef2||50||Huge food market in really cool part of London. If you have the luxury of cooking facilities, shop here and try delicacies you have never seen before. We happened to be there on Friday evening at closing time and the stall holders were practically giving away food. There are also lots of cool pubs in the neighborhood.||October 26, 2013
matt094||50||If you love food and fresh produce, this market is for you. Even if you don't you will after you have been here. Sampling all the fresh produce and seeing things you have never seen before, the Borough Markets is a must when you visit London. Been here for more than 500 years, the atmosphere, smells will make you hungry even if your not. A great place to go if your hungover as well. Highly recommend to everyone.Thank you Jazzy.||October 26, 2013
fridaysga||50||With so much to see and taste, this place is a favorite of ours to visit! Vendors are always helpful, vegetables and fruits are displayed beautifully. Cheeses are there to see, baked goods, teas...what's not to like? Teen daughter and I and friends always enjoy seeing this market.||October 26, 2013
SHCHowe||50||Amazed by the sights, colors, scents, liveliness of the place. Artisanal. Hand picked. Organic. What a treat! A must visit for any foodie or food enthusiast. ||October 26, 2013
Lawrence K||50||Great selection of foods ranging from fruits, vegetables,, seafood, cheese ,meats spices.... you name it.. Since there were no cooking facilities in our hotel room we got some cheese, wine ham & bread and had an impromptu picnic in a nice little court yard dining area. Go hungry and go early! ||October 24, 2013
shamwari45||40||Lovely food market. Lots of cheese, delicious breads, fruit, sweets, cakes, olive oils etc. the variety of wild mushrooms was interesting very nicely displayed. Go there for light lunch. Good location under London Bridge, a must visit.||October 23, 2013
sarahliv||50||Despite the policeman at the tube not knowing where the market was we followed our noses, literally, and found ourselves in a gastronomic paradise. Only regret was as were going onto the theatre that evening couldn't participate in buying amazing breads, cheeses, cider etc! Wonderful street food, friends recommended a grilled cheese and leek sandwich on sour dough bread, apparently this stall recently won the best street food award?? Nice to celebrate our wedding anniversary and sip prose do as we wandered the stalls sampling! Apparently, friends say if you turn up late afternoon you can pick up some bargains especially breads! We will return with a large bag!||October 23, 2013
2flyby||40||Who says the food is lousy in England! While I have never agreed with that view, those who do and then visit Borough Market will have to eat their words. The fresh made food section of the market is an international travelers delight. On a beautiful day in London why not head here and just graze your way through the vast choices available. Harrods food hall would set you back but the Borough makes you feel like you are saving money but still having an experience! Great for all world travelers.||October 23, 2013
Chris6729||40||If you enjoy markets a long afternoon at Borough Market is thoroughly recommended.A wide variety of goods on sale including lots of tasty street food and beverages to sample along the way!..we visited on a Saturday||October 22, 2013
thepope3_12||50||Better than Harrods Food Halls!We loved it! The samples were great. There is a wonderful variety of food stuffs. The coffee shop is fantastic. The fresh vegatables and breads are amazing. It was fun to sit and savor a snack and to people watch. Highly reccommmended.||October 22, 2013
STUMG69||40||What an amazing and extremely busy place, lots of stalls filled with local produce. Look for the salt beef sandwich stall, they are outstanding. I think there are a couple of them, however this one sits beside a butchers stall, they also do burgers which are nice but not a patch on the salt beef. If you are up for tasting some food then this is the place to be. Fruit, breads, cheese, wines, burgers, hot dogs and if I haven't already mentioned it salt beef...||October 19, 2013
Dontknow125||40||I was brought here by a tour guide and I ended up loving this place! There are a tonnnn of places to shop around and plenty of food booths. There are almost too many places to choose from. I have never seen so many assortments of foods in one place. You could definitely spend lots of time and money here. I absolutely recommend visiting if you have the chance.||October 18, 2013
jellioth||50||Whenever I am in London, and that is very frequently, Borough Market is a must go to place. Whether it is for bread, cheese, meat of most description or fish or just to enjoy a breakfast at Maria's it's is great place. Don't forget the other food stalls - and the 'street food'. this is just a great place to spend some time - many outlets are now open 6 days every week. But it is about the whole area - too many great coffee shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants to mention. It does get outrageously busy on Saturdays but that just confirms its appeal||October 18, 2013
Nicolagsmith||30||I was really looking forward to experiencing the hustle and bustle of this foodie paradise but was a bit disappointed to find that at 11am on what was supposed to be a full market day (Wed), only some of the stalls and units were open. Not many shoppers either. Will try again next time I'm in London on a Friday.||October 18, 2013
dtnh||50||If you enjoy a farmers market, you will love this place. Most of the market is covered. We liked that we could get a glass of wine and enjoy people watching. There is a huge variety here.||October 17, 2013
Facil_Traveler||50||nothing much to add to the list of excellent reviews, except to express my sincere agreement with all the 5 stars. this is a one-of-a-kind place that exudes energy and fun. we ate at a restaurant near this because we wanted to sit, but noted that there are several places inside the market with seating. walking the market with some wine (hot or cold), enjoying the sounds, smells and sights is truly a good time.||October 16, 2013
mdemorgs||40||Fresh meats cooking, coffee being brewed, brownies and cakes fresh from the oven and melted cheese being scrapped onto fluffy potatoes. If you like the sound of that, you'll want to visit this place. Can get crowded in peak times/Saturdays which might frustrate a few people but come with an empty belly and buy lots of things to eat and share between your family/friends and you will walk away satisfied. A lovely perk to London south of the rive and right next door to London Bridge train/tube station.||October 16, 2013
Outofmyattic||50||The market is just by the side of London Bridge Station. It has stalls from every part of the globe selling the most wonderful fresh and homemade food. My favourite parts are the spices and the lovely Oil Man where I always buy at least 6 bottles of his Lemon Oil. There are great smells from every part of this lovely old market it is worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to spare. You will need to check then the market is open as I am not sure it opens every day.||October 16, 2013
PapaBear2013||50||This place is incredible! It is better than any food market in the U.S.! It is VERY easy to spend hours here wandering around and eating/drinking. They serve alcohol, which is very nice. You'll find many people walking around with a bottle of champagne, etc.This is a MUST-DO on any London holiday!||October 15, 2013
Mrs_OzKent||40||If you are a food lover this is an absolute must, get there early because it does become very difficult to move because of the crowds around the middle of the day. Cheese lover will be in heaven as will bread lovers. The range of ready cooked food on offer was mind boggling, oils and vinegars are very popular too.If you are in any way claustrophobic or have a short fuse on people brushing into you, then give it a miss, but if you are more interested in the atmosphere and the food then just buckle up and enjoy.I ended up buying cuts of meat very rarely, if ever, available in a supermarket, about 6 varieties of cheese never had before, chutney I haven't tired before and had loads of fun doing it.A real must.||October 14, 2013
Rosemary F||50||Amazing food market. Well with a visit. Loved it. We wandered around for over an hour trying little snippets of food and saw food that I haven't seen for ages. Lovely. I bought some amazing veg including fantastic mushrooms.||October 13, 2013
travel4me2010||50||Fantastic range of great quality produce beautifully displayed. Go and browse and pick up treats from the stalls to eat on the go or take home and savour later. Plenty of good restaurants too, spoilt for choice.||October 13, 2013

agbells||40||i would love this even more if it was OPEN when i went!!! I was so excited as I was taking the subway to Borough Market and as I was walking towards Borough Market and noticed almost all the shops are closed, i was so disappointed! Sudden Sadness.I only got to see a few vendors and eat at a couple places. But I can imagine how fun this place would be if every vendor is opened. The location is nice and there are areas for you to sit and enjoy your food. The restrooms are so clean! For a public place, the restrooms are nice. Doesn't smell bad at all. I would love to see the different vegetables and fruits from different vendors and try even more light bites.||October 12, 2013
jonzarych||40||It's not really a surprise that almost everything t Borough Market carries a high price tag, but it is worth warning you about. The market boasts almost every type of good you would are to try but the task of making it a central London purchase inevitably makes the prices high. There's lots of goods to sample, plenty of hot food to eat, and enough to carry away home with you. From seafood to wine to camel burgers, it's all here. The bratwurst comes highly recommended. The only other negative is that the queues for hot foot are fairly long, but tend to move fairly quick. Enjoy. ||October 12, 2013
Jeff P||40||Borough Market was an unlikely tourist attraction, at least for me, but when we got there I could see what the attraction is. We were there on a cold day in the first week of January, and mulled wine was being sold by the glass. The combination of the warmth and mild buzz from the wine with the energy of the place and the friendliness of the stall-keepers made for a pleasant hour or so. And I’m sure it would have been much the same without the wine. It’s the place and the people that count, hands down.It claims to have a reputation as the country’s most renowned food market, and if so, it’s with good reason. It’s pretty large, with lots of stalls, and even on this cold day, it was busy with locals doing their shopping. The market itself started in the 13th century, when various traders around London Bridge were relocated there.The variety of foods on offer, from British to international, is pretty big, too. The full market is open Thursday, Friday and Saturday, while the Green market is open Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Check their web site for specific hours. The nearest underground is London Bridge. No dogs are allowed, other than guide dogs, it’s a smoke free area, and it’s in the congestion zone. Those are the things to be aware of before setting off.Depending on what you’re planning to do, you might need permission before taking photographs or filming, but most stalls allow photographs for customers.Overall, it’s a good place to visit, and a real boon for the local residents||October 11, 2013
Jody P||50||We were visiting London and staying in a hotel nearby Borough Market, so we decided to explore this market. It is amazing! Everything looks so delicious. We just wandered throughout, purchasing some snacks, sandwiches, and sweets. There is such a huge variety of food! I only wish I could go there to shop and purchase food for at home. If you enjoy food markets, I think this is a must-do while in London.||October 11, 2013
Wayne-P57||30||I've been here and there are people and food from all parts of the world, my only criticism of the market is it is a little bit expensive for what it is, having said that there are some very unique opportunities to try all sorts of things you may never have seen or thought of. Well worth a visit.||October 11, 2013
Marguerite K||50||1. Take your sweetie to Borough Market for their birthday.2. Go on a Thursday morning if you can, you'll get the best selection and the smallest crowds.3. Don't leave without having at least one decadent, new-to-you treat.4. Take a break and wander to nearby attractions.5. Come back to Borough Market for lunch.6. See another attraction, like standing tickets at The Globe.7. Stop by Borough Market afterward for dinner ingredients.8. Bliss. :-)||October 10, 2013
Rainne_T||50||I've read a lot about Borough Market when I was researching on markets to go during my first trip to London, and from all the raving reviews, I was certainly having some high expectations of this food market that even locals were raving about. And it certainly did not disappoint! From kebabs to hotdogs to cheese to organic oatmeal and ice cream, they literally have almost every kind of food you can think of, and then some. I walked past a stall that sells cakes, and for some reason I stopped to look at what they have. I'm a sucker only for cream cakes, and this stall doesn't have any. They have some cheesecakes, some brownies, but I was somehow captivated by this "Zesty Lemon Cake" that looks so ordinary. Deciding to just throw caution to the wind (after all this is my first visit to London! Shouldn't think so much when trying new food!), I bought a slice of that zesty lemon cake despite not being a fan of anything lemon-ish (I hate lemon stuff). And the first bite just made my eyes go wide as it tastes fabulous! It wasn't too sour, nor was it too sweet. The balance was great, and each bite was a refreshing one. It was so good that I almost didn't want to share it with my partner. I reluctantly let him have a bite in the end, and even he said that it was fantastic (and he was one of the most critical food critic I've ever known). I'm sorry I couldn't remember the name of the stall (I'm bad with names!), but I think there's only one stall there that sells such cakes. There's another stall that sell mostly cheesecakes, but this isn't it. I've attached a picture of the zesty lemon cake so that fellow travellers could seek it out if they are interested. My partner found himself tasting some sample bits of a chocolate chip cookie and he bought one almost immediately. He said the cookie literally melts in your mouth, and he finished a HUGE one on his own (they looked really big!). Cost £2 each.There are also other exotic produce that's being sold in Borough Market, and all you need to do is just explore and walk around. Vendors and stallholders are kind enough to let you take photos of their food too. Absolutely wonderful market.I would go London again JUST to go this market and of course, to have that zesty lemon cake again!||October 9, 2013
KTuck78||50||Whenever we have friens to stay we usually take them to Borough Market for a wander round - and a pint in the Market Porter. Prices for food can be a little on the steep side and it's easy to get carried away. I don't think you can beat the duck baps just by the market porter pub for a tasty bite, but there is plenty of choice. Fridays and saturdays it can get absolutely rammed - but that's when the largest number of stalls are there. But weekdays there are also plenty of places open to grab a bite for lunch. Well worth factoring into a walk along the south bank on your way to the tate or from Tower Bridge into town. If you go on a weekday grab some money before you go - the queues for the cashpoints can be hoorendous around that area and sometimes run out!||October 9, 2013
Antoanna888||50||We arrived from Gatwick to the London Bridge station, and being hungry decided to go straight away to market, that is just opposite the station. The market was full of people and the smell of the food kept us going deeper deeper into the market. You can find anything here, from vegetarian food, pies, desserts, candies, cakes, juices, burgers to breads to buy and eat as you go. There only thing was that it was a little bit hard to fine drinks to accompany your snacks or meals. There are some restaurants also inside. If you go deeper inside the market you will find vegetables, cheeses, fishes and all you can imagine for sale to cook at home. One curious place was the exotic meet stall, they cad zebra, kangaroo and what not, and even made burgers of these to go! We would have loved to return to this market again during our short stay, but we will for sure next time we visit! ||October 9, 2013
Barb_Trvl||40||What a great experience, had THE BEST duck confit sandwich. Very crowded around lunch time, we bought dessert and wondered around looking at all the interesting stalls.||October 9, 2013
PatC44||40||Although we went late in day, there were still some stalls open, cheeses and vegetables. Lovely street food - Indian, traditional pies, wraps - all sorts of food. It didn't seem expensive. I'm sure earlier in the day it would have been far busier and more of the stalls would have been open. The architecture is fantastic but its worth visiting to see the beautiful glass sitting area with the hops growing up the side, eating your lunch & sitting and watching the traffic drive past.||October 8, 2013
319stewartt||50||I cannot believe that after so many trips to London, this past visit was my first to Borough Market. Both a feast for taste, smell and sight! Spectacular displays of produce, meats and fish and plenty of samples of many cheeses, fruit and meats. I could have spent the whole day there. I particularly appreciated that many of the vendors were highly knowledgable of the products. A true foodie paradise. My first visit but certainly not my last! I shall be back!||October 7, 2013
fred1854||50||We stumbled upon the markets by pure accident. We were in the area to take photos of the Shard and were looking for the Underground or rail line to take us back to our apartment and low and behold under a railway bridge we found the markets. I felt like a kid in a lolly shop and wanted to try every sort of food available. You will need to restrain yourself as there are numerous stalls carrying foods from all over the world. Well I started will Spanish paella and then the chorizo, Italian cheeses and bread which was heavenly. We bought some smallgoods which we brought back to apartment and consumed needless to say we did not go out to dinner that night. I am afraid to say I was an absolute glutton. We attended on a Saturday afternoon and the place was buzzing the atmosphere was incredible.||October 6, 2013
Megan H||50||I love borough market - the athomphere is incrediable and every stall has something different. Be careful of the cost - many stallholders have complex prices that are sure to rip off the unsuspecting customer. However the ready to eat stalls provide best value clear price food - the chicken curry stall is one of the best I had. Don't miss the turkish stall opposite the flower shop/pub - £1.50 for the most delicous turkish delight short bread. So much to see and do in southwark too - don't bother with a tube. Thourghly enjoyable walk along the river from london eye and so much to feast your eyes on. Also close to st.pauls - milliuem bridge connects the two sides of river ||October 6, 2013
NinaTom||50||Have visited many times and Borough Market rarely misses the mark. Vast array of foods to eat on the spot or take home; good opportunity for a swift drink and a great atmosphere. Yes it's busy, but don't let that put you off. ||October 6, 2013
theresaw||50||Stayed in a the Hilton nearby & anxiously awaited the Borough's opening on Thurs (only opened Thurs - Sat). Spent a good 2 hours walking among the booths offering all kinds of meat, seafood, cheeses, sweets, coffees, etc. the lighting is incredible & it's filled with so much color, I must have taken 100 photographs while there. If you like to eat...don't miss this place!||October 5, 2013
maeve27||50||This was one of the best experiences we've had in London! The food, the atmosphere, it was simply amazing! I had to convince my husband to come here but when he did, he absolutely loved it. Lots of food to choose from!||October 2, 2013
Farndale_Cowboy||40||Visited Borough Street market quite by chance and, whilst I can see why some visitors find it a little pretentious, it's worth wandering round.Located under the rail tracks and full of interesting architecture if you look beyond the stalls, it offers a good range of stalls and some quite unusual produce, of which many of the stallholders are prepared to offer a tasting.Not your everyday shopping market, but very interesting location and stalls.||October 2, 2013
CWAdams||50||After exploring the Tate Modern and having a quick glance at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre we managed to run into these markets and grab a bit to eat. This was exactly the delicious fuel/food me and my girlfriend had been looking for throughout our hiking from one attraction to the other and helped us have the energy to climb the Monument.Having experienced some poor quality food while running around London it was quite refreshing to find something that could be ordered quickly and was delicious for under 5 pounds. If you are in the area, it’s definitely worth a pit stop during your London site trekking.Definitely not your average markets.||October 1, 2013
habzy||40||We stumbled across the market on our way to the shard, very glad we did! Of course we knew of the market, but didn't realise it was nearby. Just a quick wander through but we had some fabulous pork loin. Plenty to see and taste and well worth adding in to a visit.||October 1, 2013
jj19216||30||When we arrived it was very confusing and there were not any maps to show us where to go. I had a steak ciabatta with chilli sauce and that was delicious! There were a lot of cheese stalls. Food was nice but I was a bit disappointed with the rest of the stalls||September 30, 2013
tatianaemma||50||Borough Market has been synonymous with food as far back as 1014. Quite frankly it is heaven to me. It's my 'kid in candy store' place. I absolutely, completely, entirely love it. That's the gushing bit over. Now to what they provide...Aside from selling top notch ingredients they also sell artisanal food to eat on the go (in my opinion some of the best street food you can get in London). It's a labyrinth. A foodies dream. Everything you look at is produced with such care and thought that you can't help but walk around in awe.If you're going to eat and not just shop for ingredients then you can choose from every kind of food imaginable. I honestly don't know where to begin when describing the variety on offer, all I can say is it's highly unlikely they won't have what you're looking for.They have everything from Indian, Chinese, British, Mexican, Pastries, Cheeses, Preserves, Sauces, Meats, Hog Roasts, Soul Food to Flowers and Tableware. All stand next to each other with a lot more around the corner. It's never ending and eclectic as hell.If you decide to go I advise that you get there early as it dies down in the early afternoon and you won't get the true vibe of the market when it reaches its tail end. Part of the fun of the market is the hustle of it all, market traders shouting, smells of fresh food wafting in the air etc...We had a wonderful Sausage Sandwich with Caramelised Onion Chutney on crusty yet soft bread (£6.50). I have no problem parting with money if the ingredients are good, and at Borough Market pretty much everything they sell is above par.Borough Market10/108 Southwark StreetLondonSE1 1TJ0207 407 1002www.boroughmarket.org.uk||September 30, 2013
Germione||40||If you're into your food, you will definitely enjoy visiting Borough Market. There are loads of interesting stalls and shops. The prices are extremely reasonable considering this is central London. We visited on a Saturday midday and it started out busy but not packed and it gradually got busier and busier. I queued for about 20 minutes for the salt beef bagels! But it's definitely worth a visit - if you're not into crowds, I would highly recommend going early. Bring your appetite and plenty of cash and enjoy!||September 29, 2013
tktktktktk||50||I visited Borough Market twice. The first visit was a quick trip on Thursday morning before going on a "Muggle Tour". It was about 10:30 am and it wasn't too busy, so it was perfect for me to wander and take photos and to drool over all the cheeses and goodies. I went back on Saturday with a friend at lunchtime for the purpose of eating a paella I saw previously. I could eat here all day! I could happily just walk through the stalls and constantly snack on smoothies, sangria, macaroons, fudge, cookies, cheese, bacon sandwiches, croissants etc. Unfortunately I didn't, and limited myself to just the paella, macaroons and a piece of fudge.If you've been to Toronto (Canada), Borough Market is like a broader version of St. Lawrence Market. There are two parts to Borough Market, and both are delicious. The smaller section has the sweets, and the larger area has the butchers and food. There is an area to sit down should you want to take a break and dine, and there is also a bathroom at the Market. I really recommend visiting here for lunch, to pick up gifts, and it's a great place to take photos.||September 29, 2013
RLuiz||50||The Borough Market is definitely one of the best places to visit in London. Fruits, nuts, meats, seafood, cheese, everything you want or need you will find here, including imported goods.Inside you can also enjoy cheap and very tasty food with plenty of option, all fresh!!Highly recommended!!||September 28, 2013
poopshooter||50||This is definitely the place to visit in London. Not to be missed. Typical market you have fruits, seafood, veggies, cheese, breads and what not. However the top draw has to be the food. Expect crowds and queues but it is well worth it. We had the pork belly sandwich, salt n beef roll & German sausages. They were all yummy and to die for. Am salivating just typing this out. They also have many other international varieties from paella to curry to falafel. They all smelled so yummy and inviting. If only I had a big appetite.You can spend a few hours here taking in the smell, sights and sounds of a market. Well worth the visit even if you aren't looking for food. Got to be the best market in London. Don't miss out!||September 27, 2013
AndrewS666_666||50||We dropped in to the Borough Market and stayed for hours. The sights and sounds were amazing and the food was superb. We snacked and snacked on lots of freshly cooked, tasty food and walked and walked. It is a people watchers paradise too. It's a must do in London. Highly recommended.||September 27, 2013
VictoriaS194||50||My cousins took me to Borough Market, and I don't know how I didn't know about this market!An incredible mix of international foods are available to eat and to take home. Paella, curry, falafel, pork belly sandwich, sausage roll - you name it, it's there! You can also get a drink to enjoy with your meal - we had a sangria with the paella! We also got basque sausages to take home that were fabulous.Be prepared for crowds and line ups, but if you enjoy markets, it is worth it. Easily accessible from London Bridge station, or a 15-20 minute walk from Covent Garden area.||September 26, 2013
Ninazee||50||Fruits, veggies, meats, fish, cheese mongers, bakeries, goat’s milk ice cream (amazing!), gluten free desserts (by the Free From Bakehouse – again AMAZING!), as well as burgers, and other cooked food being served. This place is a hub of activity and you can spend hours wandering around and getting excited about the sights and smells of the wonderful market. It is only about 5 minutes from the Tate and the Globe and there are signs that direct you there so it is very easy to find. Open Thursday, Friday and SaturdayJust know that if you are gluten free, I was unable to find any food here to eat for lunch / dinner. I thought I was going to be able to eat at the burger place but they did not have plates. Same with the place that served chicken. Not a big deal, I sacrificed myself and ate goat cheese ice cream and got a brownie to-go from The Free From Bakehouse (this is not only the best gluten free brownie I have ever eaten but the best non-GF brownie I have ever eaten. I am now kicking myself that I did not grab that chocolate chili cake to bring home too!!!).||September 26, 2013
nikolieau||40||The food stalls just outside of the fresh produce market offer some of the best food that I have enjoyed in London. Lots of options for vegetarians too..And at reasonable prices.Highlights for me have been - Indian food stall (both dishes are exceptionally good. Possibly the best Indian food I have had)- vegetarian gyoza dumplings - 'quail in the hole' (4 quail eggs - delicious)- coconut pancakesIn terms of the markets themselves, the produce is magnificent but a little expensive.||September 25, 2013
Chu Beng L||40||I went to this market last Saturday, lots of people going around the various stall looking for food for breakfast. It is a good variety of choices covering western and other traditional like Asian and Middle East.Well, first time I saw huge cheeses. Very amazing to see such huge piece of cheese!A market you can feel how the local cultures and experience the morning of London.||September 24, 2013
D M||50||I have been to Borough Market during the winter and the summer. Below is my experience in each season.WINTER: Borough Market is open during the winter. Less vendors, but overall, good selection of food and treats. If you buy food, you can walk next door to the church for outside seating to eat.SUMMER: Borough Market is buzzing during the summer. Many more vendors during the summer; crowded but not too bad. Great food and treats to choose from. If you are a cheese lover, you must stop at the Kappacasein stall at Borough Market to get the best grilled cheese you will ever have!. They are only at this location Thursday-Saturday. Click on the link for more information: http://www.kappacasein.com/Because there is a huge selection of food and treats, it would be wise to pick a spot and time for everyone in your party to meet. It appears that most people meet at the small church next door to the market.||September 24, 2013
Lisa R||50||We went primarily to get the toasted grilled cheese sandwich that Samantha Brown had on one of her shows, but we experienced so much more! You just walk through the market and see all kinds of fresh foods...from fresh seafoods to toasted nuts, from wines to candies. There are different sections, so take the time to walk through it all, grabbing a glass of wine and sampling things all the way through made it quite enjoyable!||September 23, 2013
BarbKs||50||We took the train to the market, its only a couple of minutes walk from the station. Fantastic foodies market! There is a huge variety of both raw and cooked food. Its a great place to soak up a real multicultural atmosphere.Not all the food is traditional 'british', but I think that just adds to the appeal. You can buy fresh fruit and veg, as well as meat, fish etc. Lots of stalls sell already made up Pimms in a cup! Bonus.There are some great cheeses to be had at the market as well as oysters and chocolates.We bought quiche, cheese and biscuits, tomatoes and gerkins, the most delicious berries in the world and enormous meringues with chocolate bits in them, a bottle of great wine from one of the shops across the road and had a feast for dinner. It was quite crowded by 12:30 lunch time, so we headed to one of the several pubs in the street within the market and had a great pub lunch, heading back afterwards to shop a bit more.The facilities are good, with places to sit down and eat, most of it is undercover, and toilets within the market. Throughout the market there are lots of free samples to try as well.This was a really surprising, but great day out, and we felt like we had really sampled London.||September 23, 2013
chiselstone||50||Borough Market is one of my favourite places to be in the world. It's a food market through and through. You get vegetables, fruits, raw meats, etc. but you also get preserves, hams, roasts, cheeses, chocolates, bread... It's literally a smorgasbord there! I'm not a local so cannot comment on how reasonable the prices are there, but the variety of foodstuffs available there is incredible. And there is much you can sample before you buy, so you can spend a whole morning there, sampling the meats and cheeses, then getting a sandwich and a coffee, before lugging all your purchases home to restock your kitchen.||September 22, 2013
SalsaKing||50||Returned to the market after about 3 years and really noticed a difference. The place has really taken off with much better facilities for sitting down to eat your food, bins and toilets etc. Still one of the best places in London to try wonderful British and world food. There was a much larger selection this time showing the markets success and by lunchtime you will be jostling with people from all over the world trying to decide what to have. Plenty of free samples but also plenty of choices for a meal on the hoof!you won't find "market bargains" but you will find quality and diversity.||September 22, 2013
Peter R||50||This is so worth a visit if you love good food to buy or eat there. The variety and qualiity of everything is outstanding and it is a great experience. You could eat for free from free samples or spend a small fortune (or both). You could also just browse and enjoy the sights and smells but you'd need better willpower than me. It does get crowded on Saturdays so woth turning up early!||September 22, 2013
Ida2934||50||Went there for the first time a month ago, and was really impressed. They're selling meals for immediate consumption as well as a wide range of goods to stock up you kitchen supplies. Recommended!||September 22, 2013
51jaredh||50||We just so happened to fall upon Borough Market and it was one of the highlights to our 3 day London trip! We had started our walk at Blackfriars station (Underground train) and then walked across the millennium bridge to Tate Modern Museum. From there we walked east along the south bank of the river. We passed many great sites like Shakespeare's Globe Theater, The Anchor tavern, and the Clink Street Museum. Walk through the alley where the old sailing vessel "Golden Hinde" is located and there is Borough Market. It is a great quaint open air market with vendors of everything. Fresh market foods, macaroons, pastries, tarts, breads, cheeses, wines, beers, etc. We picked up some truffle oil and fig preserves as they are both expensive in the States but sold there for half the price! What a great experience to run in to while walking London, but were told it was only open Thurs, Fri, and Sat...and we went through on Thurs. It was busy with lunch time business traffic, but that added to the flare of the market! Easiest stop with least amount of walking though would be at the London Bridge station stop on the Underground Tube system. The vendors we used took credit card. Great activity right before crossing London Tower Bridge to visit the Tower of London for the second half of the day.||September 21, 2013
Alistair L||50||Despite having travelled to London on several occasions, and now moved down here, I had not been to the Borough Market; I didn't realise just how much I was missing out on!The sights, the smells, and the tastes (especially the tastes) were fascinating, and delicious.Between my party of five, we purchased truffle oil, lincolnshire poacher cheese, three differing salami's, foccacia bread, a wide variety of olives, chocolate wine and kangaroo (yes, kangaroo) meatballs. And this was just to take home! Whilst on our 2 hour wander around the market, we treated our selves to a sumptuous chorizo and pepper ciabatta, a few pints of home brew cider (I recommend roots and fruits-a hearty ginger flavour), oysters, two salted beef sandwich's, calamari and a home made, fresh from the oven elcair!AS you can see, we spent rather a lot, but there is no pressure at all from any of the traders to buy anything, and they are all very friendly and more than willing to offer you free samples.A great day out, and will definitely be going again (once I have some more money!)||September 21, 2013
AngelaBax||50||This must be the best market I have ever been to - we tried lots of the foods available and all of it was outstanding, fresh and of the highest quality. Foods range from the most beautifully made pastries to outstanding burgers, street food, cheeses, meats, breads, vegetables and homemade sweets. A MUST DO if you visit London.||September 21, 2013
Jomax100||50||There has been a market on this site since 1014 - and it shows no signs of slowing down. The large, open building has its permanent tenants and in between, the smaller outlets. We bought olives, bread, cheese (from Bath - delicious!), strawberries, cake and sausages. We had a bratwurst on a stick and a pretzel for lunch but could have chosen from paella, curry, raclette, duck sandwiches or a roast dinner, amongst other things. Meat, fish, freshly shucked oysters, artisanal breads, pastries, cakes, cheeses, olives, olive oil, truffles, small goods, fruit and vegetables were all there. And tucked away on one side, a barber's shop. Outside the market, you'll find other interesting shops, eg Neal's Yard Dairy with its amazing range of cheeses, the German sausage shop and The Market Porter pub with benches outside.Consider visiting on Thursday or Friday when there's plenty of action, but avoid the weekend when it's very busy. After many visits to London, this was our first visit to the Borough Market. I'm not sure why it took us so long to get here but we'll be back next time to soak up the atmosphere of a true London gem.||September 21, 2013
Everyday_Diva||50||I don't consider myself a foodie, but when I worked in the area, I went at least once per week. And when I visit (as I did today) it's always on my must-do list. There are plenty of exotic and esoteric selections, but there's also a lot of just plain good eats! And the people watching and photo ops are fantastic. The market is easy enough to find for tourists - in between the Thames Path and London Bridge tube station, in the shadow of the Shard. On Thursdays and Fridays in particular, you'll find plenty of locals stepping out for a bite of lunch there as well.Tips: *While some vendors do take cards, bring cash and your own market bags to consolidate purchases.*If you want to browse without the crowds, go on Thursday, or between 10-12 on Friday.*If you want to enjoy the full chaos of the market, try Friday afternoons and Saturdays.*Don't overlook the permanent shops and restaurants along the roads bordering the market (Stoney Street and St. Thomas) - they're excellent.*Sample everything, and take the time to talk to the vendors. Many of these products are a labor of love, and the vendors I've met are so happy to talk to you about them.*It's family friendly - there's plenty to keep kids entertained (and fed).||September 19, 2013
adrianandrewlim||40||Opens on Thursdays - Saturdays, this place is those - for from the curious, the food connoisseurs to the uninitiated. I went to Borough market expecting the usual market fare but the amount of food available surprised me. From fresh food to cooked food. Sample as much as you can before buying. You might find something you didn't want to buy, but have to buy.||September 19, 2013
Shannon T||50||Borough Market is probably my favorite market/shop to go to for some lunch and special shopping. Me and my boyfriend are both self proclaimed 'foodies' and love the good stuff and finding new things. We LOVE it here, definitely a place for foodies! It is a bit pricey and we usually keep it for special occasions, but lunch and some things are a great price and if I lived around there I would definitely be there more. The falafel we had was incredible, and the raclette, don't even get me started how much I love it. The Ginger Pig has the best steaks! It is a beautiful market, fresh and vibrant, with great produce, specialty items, beer, seafood, loads of desserts and breads and cheese....just make sure to go (I think they are fully opened now on wednesday) so either wednesday/thursday would be ideal otherwise it gets really crowded during fully open days!||September 17, 2013
mariavL6892VI||40||I'm a foodie and this place is such a fun way to spent an afternoon! Found great tea, and pastries. And the people there are extremely patient and friendly!||September 15, 2013
JoJoJules||40||On the way back from a recent holiday with the family we visited friends in London, as a self-confessed foodie i had been meaning to go to Borough Market for while now. It surpassed expectations, the smells and sights alone are worth the trip. There were enough free samples of lovely sweet things to keep the kids happy and hubbie loved the ale tasting. Will be returning!||September 12, 2013
Rallyman23||50||It's probably a good job that Borough Market is only open three days a week (Thursday-Saturday) or I would be bankrupt by Christmas! The market is packed with stalls selling everything from artisan breads, the best mushroom pate ever, delicious cheese and all manner of fish and meat.It's as much a tourist attraction as a market so take sharp elbows if you want to do some serious shopping (and beware of pickpockets - not a serious issue but just a wise precaution). There are cashpoints at banks just outside for anyone suffering a 'blown wallet' and be prepared to spend serious money - but you won't regret it.There are plenty of food stalls in and around the market for a mid-shop pit stop||September 11, 2013
DellaM211||50||I can't say enough about how wonderful Borough Market is. There has been active trading at this location for over 1000 years. The most tantalizing feast for the senses. And you can buy lunch for 5 pounds. Best toasted cheese sandwich ever: Kappacassein. Best coffee I've ever had in my life: Monmouth Coffee. We were in London for 9 days and we stopped at Borough Market 5 times (and it took us a 30 minute train ride to get there). Well worth it!||September 11, 2013
DawnCardiff||40||Excellent place to browse for the foodies. The cheese stalls especially out of this world. Wish I could have bought some to bring home but the weight and smell would have cleared the train!!! but I like smelly cheeses.The fish considering London is not by the sea (ok the river is there) was a wonderful array. The meat and deli stalls a sight and taste for sore eyes.Would go back again.||September 10, 2013
JSCBrighton||50||Borough Market has been on my foodie "bucket list" for some time but this was the first time I was able to visit. I simply loved it! You can find almost anything you want - pastries, chocolates, pies (both sweet and savory), cheeses, spices, fresh baked breads, charcuterie, and fresh produce.Absolutely recommend getting there early in the morning as the market gets very crowded later in the morning. Don't miss the duck confit sandwiches, coffee at Monmouth, and cheeses at Neal's Yard Dairy.This market is a must-see for any foodie visiting London.||September 9, 2013
lmev||50||Fantastic market in Southwark area of London. Very extensive range of goods and produce, mainly food. Lots of herbs and spices, cheeses, teas/coffees, vegetables, fish, meats, breads etcPlenty of samples to try before you buy. Fairly expensive prices but may be worth it for the unusual organic and fresh produce. Bought lots here. Not enough room in my case for everything. I'll just have to go back again soon! Very nice area and good restaurants around. Very close to Guy's Hospital and the Shard. Also close to the railway station and underground.||September 8, 2013
Schuurminator||50||We had intended to head to the Tower of London for some sightseeing but did a diversion to these markets on the recommendation of a friend - we were so glad we did and needless to say never made the Tower!The weather was perfect and we indulged in paella and a jug of sangria sitting on crates but not before walking through and looking at all the fabulous fresh food ranging from home cooked pies to Indian food.We left the Market full and happy with handmade Turkish Delight (of various flavours) and dark chocolate honeycomb. It was a great day and we easily got there on one of the Hop On, Hop Off buses (as we had a two day pass) but no doubt the metro. An get you there!!||September 8, 2013
Numpty9||40||Have always wanted to visit this market and noticed the entrance as I came out of London Bridge. Really busy but easy to get served and see what was on offer and there was so much on offer. If you're hungry, this is the place to be.... So much choice. Great experience, lovely food, fab atmosphere.||September 8, 2013
Keyless||40||If you are a foodie looking for great and varied ingredients or a market browser wanting cheep nosh of excellent quality then this one is for you. Lots and lots of free tastings of cheese, chocolate, hot and cooked treats. Fabulous variety in fruit and veg too, from various varieties of field mushrooms to potted herbs for the windowsill . Very busy and crowded by 11.30 but that only added to the atmosphere . Be prepared to queue for the popular coffee and hot chocolate vendors.A great way to spend a Couple of hours on a Saturday morning south of the river in London.||September 7, 2013
Royles-Tandem||40||Fantastic variety of produce great atmosphere >Try the chilli hot chocolate at the chocolate shop.Lots of foods to sample >||September 7, 2013
OutOfSydney||50||Well, on a Saturday, definitely. By noon the crowd has started pouring in - time to get out! Go early, taste everything, buy something and leave before you get trampled to death.My pick was the fresh scallops with stir fried vegetables; served with a wedge of lemon, for 5 pounds. Not on a par were the dumplings, 4 for 3 pounds - doughy, little filling but tasted ok with their good chilli sauce. The duck confit in a roll had generous amount of duck (quite salty) so it's best if you can find someone to share it with their white sangria - 8 pounds for roll and drink. I must go back as there's the paella, the steaks, the curries, the salted beef, the small goods, the exotic meats and sausages and much much more. I took home some delicious granola, some scrumptious baklava and a variety of fruit.A wonderful morning.||September 7, 2013
1984falk||50||On from thursday to saturday this is a must do for a good cheap lunch and an amazing experience. We ate at the cafe brood right next to the cathedral, a beautifull place! quite busy a bit of a wait for food and difficult to get a table, but theres a beatifull lawn next to the cathedral were you can also sit||September 6, 2013
earthtravelller||50||Visited the market after a trip up The Shard just a short walk away at London Bridge station. The market is housed in a traditional market building and on stalls under the rail arches in the shadows of Southwark Cathedral so found the surroundings authentic and interesting, a taste of the real London rather than the glossy tourist traps. There was an amazing variety of fresh foods from every cuisine available and lots of opportunity for tasting. It was also a pleasure to just wander the stalls of produce from small organic producers from around the UK. Everyone was friendly and there was a great buzz about the placePicked up all sorts of unusual food items to take home as well as eating on the hoof.The area was frequented by locals and tourists alike and we will certainly be returning when in the vicinity again.||September 5, 2013
Gary M||40||Wonderful outdoor market with so much temptation. Plenty of free tasting, great outdoor eating experiences, terrific choices, lively and friendly. ||September 5, 2013
Frank S||40||Borough market is all about food full of atmosphere. On the thursday i went there was an international food fayre on. The smells and tastes were amazing - but between the two of us we managed to spend £50 in an hour! Great buskers and bars all around it too. And we got off at London Bridge tube - right under the Shard which is incredible.||September 5, 2013
Jolene H||40||This was a great experience! The marketplace is big, airy and full of good things! We enjoyed all the British foods for sale and the specialty markets. Everyone was so nice at the shops as well. It was not too far from the Tube station too so walking to it was a breeze. It should be on your "to do" list while in London.||September 4, 2013
EYorksTravelMan||40||Visited Borough Market with my girlfriend just after christmas'13. (she is a bit of a food buff), the market is easily accessible via 'Tower Bridge' tube station which is a mere 500 meters away at the most.Greeted by the warm smell of roasting nuts, fresh seasoned meats and an array of colors from food all over the world. Borough Market is truly an abyss for both food lovers and those like myself who just enjoy sampling the various cuisines on offer in London.||September 4, 2013
gavin d||50||Fabulous organic food market. Extremely popular with the locals and tourists alike. You will find yourself saying 'wow look at that'. This market is packed with people and wonderful food. Don't miss it.||September 4, 2013
MarkT1958||50||Foodie heaven! Particularly enjoy the free tasters from the stalls. Whatever food you enjoy you're sure to find something to tickle your tastebuds from Kent charcuterie to amazing cheeses in Neals Yard||September 4, 2013
anamM4618NS||50||Excellent historical market place to try variety of local produce, eat affordable dishes of just about every nationality. Great to spend a lazy afternoon or morning. ||September 3, 2013
Lhodkinson||50||A fantastic place to get an appetite. There are hundreds of stalls selling all sorts of delicacies - fruits, spices, meats, shellfish. We split up and grabbed a selection of food for our lunch. The roast beef sandwich was amazing. Huge, but amazing.||September 3, 2013
Masha H||30||Me and my partner are real foodies, We strolled around in this market for 3 hours and we didn't want to leave. Mostly everything there taste delicious and prepared carefully. However, we were disappointed when we landed on some burger stall that looked good, but it was very disappointing in taste, and bland. I thought Borough market only allow high quality food, but it seems not. So you have to take your time choosing on what you want to eat.||September 3, 2013
itai1984||50||this market is huge and has large variety of food for take away.you can find almost any dish you can think of indian , south american and european food etc..prices range between 4.5-5.5GBP a dish , great value for money.||September 3, 2013
lmlmlmjm||50||My wife has been telling me about Borough Market since she visited the place a few years ago and I have to say now that I've been I'm very impressed. It has such a great atmosphere and the food available is wonderful. If you are hungry then you must visit this market. The only downside is that there is too much choice! I'm envious of anybody living in the area and having this on your doorstep. Will definitely be back.||September 2, 2013
NBMel||50||Loved this market, so much so that I visited twice during my week in London! The vendors are very friendly and knowledgeable, and there is a wide selection of food choices. My favorite part was that you can buy drinks to enjoy at the market and I indulged in a few delicious Prosecco spritzers, which helped to make the crowds more tolerable! Lunch time during the week can be quite busy, so try to arrive early.||September 2, 2013
jaijaiUK||50||The best part of this fantastic market is sampling the vast variety of food for sale ie french cheeses etc. My most favorite thing to sample was the truffle oil. The fragrance and flavour are perfection! White truffle oil is stronger than the black and quickly became my favourite!||September 1, 2013
859amandam||50||A must see area! Southwark is a great area to check out and this market was so unexpected! Lots of shops/ stalls to get all kinds of food, fruit, vegetables and meats. We stopped here on a tour we were taking and grabbed a quick lunch! Highly recommend!||September 1, 2013
AdrianVoiculescu||50||It's a place where you can buy and eat products you don't find nowhereelse in London. You can find good food in many places and you can taste almost everything. Try the duck sandwich ( 5 £) .||August 31, 2013
Keenfamily4||50||Lots of stalls with amazing food and produce, only problem is deciding what to eat, as it all looks and smells so good. Luckily most stalls allow tasting. Well worth a visit. ||August 29, 2013
imranh872||50||Whenever you come to London this one of the place you should not be miss. A wide variety of food to choose from. It range from paella, cheeses, desserts, asian cuisine, middle east, african cuisine, classic fish and chip, and lots more. Whole lot of fresh fruits and vegetables, fish and seafood.

MIA01Melbourne||50||This has everything to quirky food shops great eating everything spent time just wandering they the stalls and enjoyed every minute the curry is magic ||August 28, 2013
edmontontravel||50||What an afternoon we had at the market - by far the best food we had in London. There were 3 of us travelling together, so we bought a variety of dishes and shared while drinking multiple Prosecco spritzers; bring lots of cash and don't let cost get in the way - just close your eyes and have fun. The duck confit sandwich was so amazing we went back for a second - the best sandwich I've EVER had. The chorizo sandwich was amazing as well with the pepper and toasted bun. The paella and curry bowls were both delicious, as was the calamari (not one bad calamari on the trip!). The macarons were a delicious desert, and the German cheesecake was a great take home treat. My mouth is watering.||August 27, 2013
LondonChiswick||30||We did check website and market was open for lunch on Tue but it was a bit disappointing in terms of variety of stalls and excitement. My friend had an excellent hog roast ciabatta sandwich but if you are like me and don't eat bread, I couldn't find a stall that sold nice food that wasn't in a "sandwich" of bread or wrap. Recommend go only on a Fri/sat or Sunday when market is in full swing ||August 27, 2013
699Caroline1||50||love this market people are so friendly all happy to help it gets very busy lots & lots to try and of course buy we got some fresh fish I stall holder was so happy to tell us how to cook the fish etc. It is a did hard to get round if you a pushchair but do let that put you off lots of places to buy & have a cup of tea with your lunch well worth a visit ...||August 27, 2013
Jane D||50||The Borough Market near London Bridge train station is a must for anyone who loves food. It has a covered market of fruit and vegetables etc but the world food market section is outstanding. Our sons loved the salt beef stall and i loved the pie shop. Everything is extraordinary. Go hungry!!||August 27, 2013
lola2882||40||i went there on a sunny day in london and it was brilliant. The market is nicely done,clean and you can find whatever your are looking. is not that busy as camden market, and there are lots of places to sit down and enjoy a cocktail,finger food,tapas etc!||August 26, 2013
reikate||50||It might even be worth the trip to London to have the raclette grilled chess for 5 pounds at this wonderful market. The other amazing food selections are too many to decribe but a huge thumbs up for the basque restaurant with sangria and pims at the foot of the stairs as well!||August 26, 2013
Colhunt||50||The area around Borough Market has a great atmosphere and the whole place just has a lovely feel about it. There are many many different food stalls to choose lunch or a snack from and every one we tried had very nice food. It is only a market but seems to have that little bit extra that makes it well worth a visit. It is a good place to start exploring the london Bridge area from and there are loads of things to to do around there. Whatever you visit in the area make sure that you do not miss this market.||August 26, 2013
BnCbrighton||50||Love it here and wish I lived on its doorstep as I would buy all my produce here. Great takeaways too to enjoy.Suggest a visit just before leaving London on an afternoon as food sold off and you can indulge in the comfort of your own home... Warning the food does smell great so try not to eat it on the train before you get home!Great place to loose yourself for an hour||August 24, 2013
1979JTR||50||Second time visiting the market, took my 7 year old son, who loved the amazing bakery stallsHuge range of produce and ready to eat hot food spread over 3-4 areas of the market.Only down side is choosing. Monmouth coffee is worth a special mention, YES people are waiting inline outside a coffee shop YES its completely worth it.Nearest tube is London Bridge, but also walkable from waterloo.Will be a must stop every visit to london from now on.||August 24, 2013
Danny M||40||very crowded in the Borough! but always interesting to visit and see whats new. All the food is a bit on the expensive side but normally very good quality. a few of the stalls reduce there prices around closing time - so good time to grab a bargain!||August 24, 2013
jefocean79||50||Luckily, our hotel was near the Borough Market. We ended up there just about every morning for coffee and breakfast. We found Monmouth coffee there, and it's amazing. There will be a line out on the street, can't miss it. The market itself truly has everything your hearts desire. Stalls with bread piled as high as you stand, meats and cheese from all over Europe, and prepared food from curries to pastries. All of the vendors were knowledgeable, helpful and happy to chat. Coupled with the bike tour, this was our best favorite time in London each day. You don't need long, take the tube one morning over to explore. Grab a coffee and sausage roll, a bacon baps, or a pastry and enjoy being in this lovely market.||August 24, 2013
Kelchia12||40||Biggest market that sells a wide array of fresh produce as well as cooked food.Stalls sell mainly cheese, fresh vegetables and fruits, salami, pastries, cakes, pies, cereal, chocolate, burgers, dried nuts and many more! Stuff are cheap and good and some provide free samples to try! Definitely a place to go for food lovers!||August 24, 2013
Littlemeezer||50||Visited Borough Market, for the first time in a long while, what a hustle and bustle place this is, wonderful food stalls of all types, delicious food smells, to tickle your taste buds. Very busy especially around lunch time. Definitely worth a visit should you be in the London Bridge area, on a Friday. Check the web for opening times. Throughly enjoyable.||August 23, 2013
David V||40||We found it by accident walking to Tower bridge and glad we did. It was busy so i guess a lot of other people were aware of it. It reminded me of the Pike market in Seattle lots of different foods to buy or eat. ||August 23, 2013
Ledolcevita||50||First of all WOW!!!If you like to visit a food market in London ,this is the place to be.The food omg, is like being in heaven, a different choices and all freshly made.The place itself has got such a nice feeling to it, very welcoming and great atmosphere.after visiting the Tower of London we went back to the market round about 6 pm and the market was closed,but again there was still a fantastic atmosphere in the same area, bars and restaurants were still open and everybody was standing in front of the pubs outside having drinks and enjoying them selfs.Definitely 5 out of 5 ||August 22, 2013
MrsMeatballs||50||A great way to spend a Saturday morning. Really feels like you are part of the city and of course the food is amazing! ||August 21, 2013
caydiner||50||Even if you don't have too much time to spend in London, make time and experience the fantastic Borough Market. Make sure you are as hungry as possible because you will need all that space in your stomach. You will probably end up wishing you could taste more stuff. The best strategy would be to do a little search of vendors and short list the ones you are particularly interested in before you go. Or you can take your chance by going for vendors that have queues lining up in front of them. Among the ones that I have been able to taste, my favorites are: beef pie with gravy sauce at Mrs King’s Pork Pies and duck sandwich at Le Marche du Quartier. Go ahead, explore and enjoy!||August 21, 2013
LittleCliff13||50||We were able to visit the Borough Market during the hustle and bustle of a saturday afternoon as well as during slower times of the week. The food we purchased there was beyond fabulous and on saturday especially it was really fun to visit all of the different vendors, cafes and taverns. This is truly a must for any food lover! Its also really beautiful and offbeat. ||August 19, 2013
cawilding89||50||So many different foods to choose its hard to make a decision! You could easily go back once a week and have something different every time! I went for a lamb and mint burger which was out of this world! A must go for food lovers!||August 18, 2013
651katiem651||50||I visit London every few months and head straight here. The best duck sandwiches in the land with a great mix of food from the world. I always make a special trip for Xmas. Its like London used to be, cobbled streets, good food and loud market traders, I am in love with it||August 18, 2013
cazzie42||40||Easy to get to and such alot of good homecooked foods, meats, cheeses, breads, cakes to fresh drinks, fruits and vegetables to buy. It was such a treat to browse around the stalls, worth a trip to get your food snacks adhoc!||August 18, 2013
Wang Yan H||40||It was great to experience the market with literally all sences: You get the opportunity to see, smell, taste exotic food, also could listen to the stories of the friendly sellers letting Thema touch your heart. Only minus point was that the place was crowded-but was already expected.||August 17, 2013
Sue R||50||Always a great atmosphere and a foodies delight. Great choice of restaurants or street food and well worth a visit!||August 17, 2013
Gator91||50||This market is full of great food and drinks. There is something for everyone. Lots of samples and great smelling food.

Ana M||50||nice place with delicious foods !you can find and taste exotic foods and buy selected ingredients . ||August 16, 2013
Unionbeach||50||Beautiful market with everything you need for a quite affordable dining experience. Two teenagers and I had duck confit sandwiches, pork pie, gelato and non alcohol beverages for under £25. Entertaining scenic walk from our Blackfriar's area hotel but tube access also available. Truffles, world class artesian cheeses, Iberia ham all with samples. Total travel channel level experience.||August 16, 2013
ARose112||50||This permanent market is located just behind Southwalk Cathedral, at the Borough tube stop. There are a lot of permanent vendors that open everyday and extra booths that open on the weekends. Stop by in the morning or around lunch for a wide variety of specialty foods. YOu can buy lots of ethnic meals, meats, cheeses, chocolates, and other goodies from local vendors. Definitely plan on having a meal here. If it is nice out, there are benches near the cathedral that you can sit on to take a break. This won't take long 15-30 minutes.||August 15, 2013
worldtraveler3112||40||quite an amazing market really, with endless selection of delectable food. we had a camel burger there which i thought didn't taste as funky as i thought! would certainly bring my friends there who are coming London for the first time!||August 13, 2013
1norfolkdumplings||40||All the times we have visited London this has escaped our radar. We love food experiences and this was up there with the best. A total experience from noise, smell and taste of a bustling market. We would love to go back great fun.||August 12, 2013
SJR03||50||A very nice variety of producers and sellers are here. Plenty to look at and plenty to try!If you are looking for unusual food then this would be the place whether you are buying to take away or eating here.||August 12, 2013
wallyfrith||50||Borough Market never fails to disappoint.The sights and smells of almost every type of food produce will titivate the senses of all visitors. Don't ever visit Borough market if you are hungry. Here you will find beautifully presented fruit and vegetables of the highest quality; superb fresh fish,even a specialist dealer in truffles! There are loads of specialist eateries in and around Borough Market, including an oyster bar. Prices seem very reasonable. Well worth a visit if you are on the South Bank.||August 11, 2013
Christine J||50||When my daughter suggested going to the Borough Market I wasnt really that bothered about going, but as we walked over London Bridge and down the steps it was packed with people sitting around eating various foods. What a surprise - the market was packed with stalls from cheese, bread, spices, fruit drinks, fish, sweets, desserts, wine tasting, fresh fruit and vegatables and much much more. There were lots of stalls offering freshly cooked food from all over the world, jerk chicke, sausage and burgers, paella chilli, steaks, fish, noodles.It was amazing and I really enjoyed walking around all the stalls, sampling the cheese, chocolate and wine tasting.A great atmosphere and well worth the visit||August 11, 2013
nbalwaystravel||50||What a great market. I have been here many times (always on a Saturday) and I never tire of it. From the great food to the fun markets stall holders, everything makes for a enjoyable day out. Go for lunch and be prepared to overeat!!You can almost get any kind of food you dream up here, it is buzzing. They let you taste food before you buy, and it is hard to resist buying once that happens. It is packed on a Saturday so maybe going on a Friday would be less crowded, I'm not sure. Gives me a good excuse to go back again before we leave London, I will let you know!||August 8, 2013
mintzfamily||50||We enjoyed the sights, smells, tastes and everything. Worth going there when in London. If you get there by lunch time you can enjoy cheap and good food with great atmosphere||August 7, 2013
AshleyW3||40||So much to eat, not enough time! It was a rainy Thursday when I went and I was lucky that it wasn't crowded. There was so much to look at. I could have bought so much food too. I stuck with some cherries and raspberries that only cost me a pound each! If I lived in London, I'd do most of my produce shopping at the markets. Go hungry and check it out!||August 7, 2013
KimH884||50||This was my 4th trip to London and I had somehow missed this! We visited on a Saturday afternoon as it's an easy walk from the Tate Modern and Globe Theater. We loved the variety of foods there and the somewhat organic layout. It was delightful getting there and wandering through the many stalls for fresh food and prepared foods. A perfect place to get lunch or a snack - hard to resist. I also loved that this is all set underneath the viaducts with trains and traffic overhead yet the bustling marketplace underneath is such a delightful place to wander and take in. So glad we found this!||August 7, 2013
Mike C||50||This is a great market with a wide selection of high quality meats, cheeses and fresh goods. There are local pubs and coffee houses around as well. I always make a point of stopping here when I am vacationing in London.||August 7, 2013
Paula L||50||I have now visited Borough market a number of times with my partner, whenever in London....and it never ceases to impress me! The atmosphere alone is enough for me to encourage anyone to go and check it out....we have always gone on a Saturday...and it is 'Buzzing' with so many people and so much to see!! The variety of foods are amazing....and the fresh fruit and vegetable display,s are truly a sight to beholden! We never come away feeling disappointed. Although a little on the expensive side....the market really does cater for everyone's tastes...and I suppose as it is in the capital....you could expect that. Our recent visit has seen a re-design, where they have modernised/updated a number of stalls. We thought it looked brilliant and worked very well....not loosing any of it's traditional looks and expectations. I particularly liked the huge glass facade that has been erected....amazing! Anyone visiting this area of London...and is a bit of a foodie....really should spend some time here....it's truly amazing....and makes you question why markets ever went out of fashion? Well done Borough Market for retaining part of our heritage!!||August 6, 2013
Spencer E||50||Wandering around and seeing things like ostrich burgers is really fun. It's a pretty big market with plenty to see and eat! Crowded, but not overly so. Definitely recommended!||August 6, 2013
cybored||40||We went to Borough on a Friday afternoon, around 1 pm. So perhaps we missed the peak lunch hour crowds. It was still crowded, but you could walk around without being totally jammed in.We had not eaten lunch, so scouted out places for the three of us. My son settled on a German bratwurst, while husband and I shared a cheese toastie from Kappacasein. We really wished we had a kitchen to cook some of the wonderful food we saw.||August 5, 2013
yummymummy099||50||What an amazing place. A true london market set underneath tower bridge and in the place where bridget jones was filmed and lock stock and two smoking barrels. The food available to buy was amazing - fresh vegetables, fruit, cheeses and other delicacies. Amazing coffees and relishes. We ate in one of the cafes and took in the ambiance - a true london experience.||August 5, 2013
DrLucyV||50||The Borough Market was at the top of my 'must-visit' list this summer before heading off to study in Oxford. As others have written before me, this is a fun foodie heaven. I took the tube to the London Bridge station and walked about 2 minutes to the market. I found vendors friendly and willing to spend some time talking about their goods like the fish monger, the man selling the market bags (which I bought), and the butchers selling the wonderful game sausages (which I ate). The man selling the market bags also has an interesting book of the history of the market. He was kind enough to give it to me gratis after I asked him about shipping home various goodies. Yes, you can eat your way through the market on samples like cheeses, pates, fruit, bread. The spanish stall was lovely and so was their classic Almond cake. I liked the art of Richard Bramble on beautiful dinner ware but couldn't carry it home so I bought his greeting cards of the market instead. The fresh beet and carrot juice was refreshing on a hot day. As another reviewer wrote, it is located in the revitalized Southbank area and within walking distance of the Thames, the Old Globe theatre (which looks new) the Southwark Cathedral (next door), the Tate Modern Museum (shich I visited) and the Millennium Bridge (which I walked across to St. Paul's Cathedral). I was not disappointed and would return in a heartbeat. I so wanted a kitchen to do some cooking with their lovely ingredients!||August 4, 2013
Amberleyadrian||10||All the crowds were at the paella bar so we thought we try the burger place next door as there was no queues. 21 day aged Herefordshire burgers sounded good but were the worst burger i have ever had esp after paying a fiver for the pleasure. Try the paella place but avoid the burger place!||August 4, 2013
mmorais8868||40||Went to borough market with my bestie from work on Saturday what a lovely experience beautiful fresh food every where, pubs, food cooking paella, thai curries and brasseries its like food heaven. Everything freshly home made breads, chutney, truffle oils cheeses, chorizo's and wines. The vendors are really accommodating allowing you to taste before you buy. This is a lovely market and well worth a visit. I will be going back time and time again.||August 3, 2013
paulm218||50||It wasn't even a full market (they take place from Thursday to Saturday) but we spent several happy hours here sampling food and drink of all kinds. Fantastic!I drank the best coffee I've EVER tasted (Monmouth Coffee) and fantastic scallops, cider and bread at various stalls. The sheer smell of the food on offer from numerous stalls at lunch time was simply mind numbing...I could have stayed there all day.||August 3, 2013
Oldbags186338||40||From days of your when they sold the produce of Kent in the covered market it has become a place for trendy foodies. Worth a visit though. Surrounded by some pretty atmospheric pubs and trendy brasseries. Part of London which needed and has been regenerated. Good place to start a walk along the South Bank after topping up on food and alcohol. Nearest tube London Bridge Borough High street exit and then across the road. Reviewed by AA Milne recently that Supermarkets are called just that because they are super!||August 3, 2013
kateo616||50||Wandered over to Borough Market during lunchtime on a weekday, hoping to satisfy a few picky eaters. There were at least 10 stalls to choose from, if not more. Excellent food--Italian, Indian and sausages were our favorites. It's even better on the weekends!||August 2, 2013
friedbananas88||40||Loved my visit here - there was plenty to see and eat! Try the very fresh oysters; all you need is a squeeze of lemon! The duck confit sandwich from Le Marché du Quartier was divine, as were the hand-dived scallops from Shellseekers which were seared and topped with a generous serving of crunchy bacon bits. Also tried the raclette - while I don't like gherkins, watching the team prepare the servings was quite fascinating! Plenty of freebie samples to be had also while you walk around and decide what to eat (and buy). However, it gets rather crowded on weekends so do go early.||July 31, 2013
mkmarcoux||50||We visited the Borough Market based on the recommendation of a friend. It lived up to its reputation. So many vendors with everything from produce, meat, cheese, and bread, to sangria. I had a cheese and onion pasty - which was just what I was craving. My wife had a duck sandwich which was a highlight of our trip. We brought some cheese and bread back to our room to snack on. If we had a Borough Market near home we would visit frequently.||July 31, 2013
ChefCliveM||50||From cheese to sushi, street food to seafood, Borough Market has it all. Taste the lovely artisanal breads, celebrate English cheeses and try some great cider and you will be sold on this fabulous cosmopolitan market. Situated by the Globe Theatre, come and enjoy the real ales brewed on the premises and enjoy some Malden oysters.||July 30, 2013
Joloo777||50||Save room at lunch one day and come here for a bite to eat. You will find something that you've never had before. I loved the Turkish delight. It's too bad you had to buy a large quantity. My falafel salad was flavorful but be careful, at times the chili sauce can be a little hot.The fruit juice drinks are interesting, they put the entire fruit into a juicer seeds and all, but it's good.||July 30, 2013
Brittnie K||40||My fiancee and I visited London via ferry on sunday...Found out this place was not open the following monday. :) lolHad a sandwhich a little shop connecting to the market on the london bridge road.. you can see the tower bridge if you wander up ||July 29, 2013
Samantha M||50||Highly recommend particularly to foodies. Wandering amongst the bustling crowds being able to sample at the majority of stalls. Such a great choice of world cuisine. Great food and drink stands all around. Would shops there daily if I lived closer.||July 29, 2013
RRH1999||50||Great eating places including a real east end style cafe, with good value portions of home cooked food. Loads of fruit and veg, meat and cheese stalls. Fabulous breads, croissants and english luxury muffins. So many Olive oil stalls and the quality was great. I visited just after opening time on Saturday morning, and was offered samples all the way round. A really pleasant morning and fun experience||July 29, 2013
natalie p||50||i have never heard of the borough market before until a family member informed me to go and have a look. i'm so glad we did as it was just food heaven. It is open all week but the full market is only open certain days so i would check the website first to enjoy the full experience of the full market. It is divided into sections such as produce, seafood, bakery etc so you just walk around and buy whatever you like either to take home or eat on the spot. Most of the booths give out free samples to try their products which if you time it right you can make a lunch out of free samples. There are booths undercover and out in the open so just take your time and browse around there is loads to visit. When you think of market i kind of think about those car boot places or riffy looking market stalls that sell junk but this market is the complete opposite to that. It is so clean and tidy and all the food just looks amazing that you would want to buy everything. It is very easy to get to it is right opposite london bridge underground station, you cant miss it. We went on a saturday quite early so it was quite quiet but the later you go the more busy it gets but i really liked this market and it was one of my highlights in london. I will be recommending this market to people and will definitely come again as i brought loads to take home.||July 29, 2013
Iveldhuis||40||Borough Market's gourmet food market has producers from all over the country bringing a range of fresh produce to the market, including fish, meats, vegetables, ciders, cheeses, breads, coffees, cakes and patisseries. Other stalls specialise in produce imported from abroad. Open Thursday to Saturday. A great place and really cheerful, but beware, not cheap||July 29, 2013
ThePoozle||50||If you've had enough of galleries and museums, fed up paying top prices for visitor attractions or just want to be out doors on a fine day, then Borough Market is well worth a visit. The fresh fruit and vegetables come from all around the world and the speciality stalls sell cheeses, meats, a variety of spices and pots and jars of things you may never have heard of. The smells are exotic and the atmosphere incredible.||July 29, 2013
JamesandPaulaOz||40||It is a great spot for food and wine (even beer) lovers. The smell of the cheeses, fresh fish and oysters.Heaps of outlets to eat also after you've been teased and tantalised.Well worth a visit.||July 29, 2013
EllenReist||40||Wonderful to visit, very charming market. however most products are not at all from the UK and highly overpriced. The atmosphere however is brilliant and the food and coffee very tasty. Nice to just wonder around and amaze yourself on the beautiful products they have and the enormous prices they dare to ask! Worth visiting!||July 27, 2013
TravellerKathy||40||I stopped into Borough Market on a Thursday morning at the recommendation of a friend. I was not disappointed.There are stalls everywhere with sweet and savoury treats. The market was bustling with punters sampling the food on offer which ranged from paella to turkish delight, cheeses to pies, and cakes to baklava.Definitely worth a visit if you're a foodie as you will not be disappointed with the range of stalls and traders all encompassed in this authentic market right across from London Bridge.||July 27, 2013
Badbones||50||The management and staff here are doing a really top job, by presenting a nice olde fashioned market area, with a wide distribution of edible products, not only from the British Isles, but from many places in Europe. It is kept spotless by a diligent band of cleaners; they even wash the tops of the garbage bins daily !!! There are adequate toilet facilities. There is a bus service to the door. The subway is moments away. It is easy to while away a full day here and still come back again. Also good to go here in inclement weather, as it is covered. Things are not overpriced and it is possible to pick up a lot of bargains. Top marks, London.||July 26, 2013
Dachemezt||50||The authenticity of the Borough Market is just splendid. All the eateries around here are local. If you have been checking out tourist locations you will undoubtedly recognize that they are littered with global food chains. If you want a break, definitely come here. The market smells really fresh and the food is fresher! I believe the market is only open Thursday through Saturday at later times (5 p.m.), otherwise you will have to come earlier on the other days (before 3 p.m.). It is closed on Sunday. But even when it is closed one can still walk through and see it. The local cafes and eateries are still open though when the market is closed, so it is still a great experience. I would suggest getting a coffee from Monmouth, or a gelato from 3BIS while you are there. Both are fantastic!||July 26, 2013
Vivyrom||40||It is by Waterloo Station. It offers food stalls (cheese, bread, fish) and flowers/plants. There are pubs and cafes around to rest for a while after a long walk. The London Bridge is steps away and also The Monument, so keep on walking!||July 25, 2013
Trudy G||50||From the minute you enter the market you are offered tastes of pastries, cheese, oils, chutneys, bread plus loads more, too many to mention. The stall holders are delighted if you enjoy their products, but there is no pressure to buy. This is definitely not a place to take a packed lunch. The disappointing part of the day was; I was unable to try everything, but I will return.Suggest getting there early to have a good look round before London arrives for lunch. Having said that; the crowds were good humoured and polite. It is also surrounded with good Restaurants and Pubs - Heaven and back.||July 23, 2013
patriciasacarvalho||50||What a place!!! This was actually my high point on visiting London.What could see as a little overpriced acutally was a great gastronomic experience. With kiosks serving all kinds of food from different parts of the world there is not enought time just to be there and not enough appetite to try everything!||July 23, 2013
louds-davo||50||This place is heaven on earth. I am so glad we made it to this market. There is everything you could ever want here at this place, i have never seen such produce, all the different mushrooms, eggs, oysters, olives, bread, lunch options... aaaahhh heaven heaven heaven!!!||July 22, 2013
hjamesp||50||Worth a visit. Great food stalls and fab breakfast. Bustling and just off the beaten track. Under the arches near the London Bridge. Good quality street food and tasters to sample.||July 22, 2013
Neil F||40||food lovers paradise, especially if you want to try something a bit different than what you normally eat, plenty of variety from a vast range of sellers, it gets crowded but you would expect that at a [place like this, really enjoyed it.||July 22, 2013
AsheeshBhat||50||My office was right next to the borough market. I would hop in for my lunch. A lot of variety, very lively, hygenic and inexpensive place. You get everything from you standard fish n chips to exotic meats like kangaroo, ostrich. A must visit place if you are in london.||July 22, 2013
Robert C||50||Drop by this old market and sample cheeses and other delicacies from all over. On the south side of the Thames two minutes from the London Bridge tube station. In the area visit the Southwark Cathedral, the oldest Gothic church in London. You are also within walking distance of the Tate Modern art museum .||July 22, 2013
CamilleWW||30||Borough Market is easily accessible from London Bridge Station (across the road). It is a bunch of produce sellers under one roof. I haven't seen anything original or different, in the food or drink on offer, than in any other ethnic shopping area. The prices are very high. It is nice to say 'I've been & I've seen' but for real shopping, for real food, for real experience I would always go to Brixton Market or shops in Harlesden - away from tourists, bigger choice for less money. The only advantage is seeing The Shard up close. ||July 22, 2013
Libby M||50||Went yesterday and it was a great way to try new food and support the locals. Food is fresh and nice but hard to find somewhere to sit once it gets crowded.||July 21, 2013
KDFaustel||50||A combination of vendors hawking their wonderful,beautiful products.....lots of little samples to try( enough for lunch if you try them all)....hilarious people watching (as they try to walk/talk/mingle while eating said lunch)....one of my favorite parts of London||July 21, 2013
gatordant||50||I've been to the market a few times in the last six months and have found a new "favorite" food vendor each time. The first time it was he falafel guy, the next time it was the sausage guys over by the cathedral, the last time it was bread and cheese. You could spend hours here just tasting foods of all types. I got hooked on the meringue puffs, the olives and the charcuterie...Also, this is a market of other things -- such as flowers and soaps, etc.Finally, if you desire to eat sitting down, the Southwark Cathedral has a nice sitting area right next door on the market side. Don't miss the cathedral by the way, it's 800 years old, has the history but lacks the crowds of other churches in London.||July 21, 2013
mayatree||50||We spent a very enjoyable and tasty couple of hours at Borough Market last week. The range of food is fantastic. My teenage girls enjoyed all the samples from the stalls and were even encouraged and agreed to try new foods and flavours. It was a great stop after a trip up The Shard.||July 21, 2013
Gosisd||50||Wow! It was my second visit at Borough Market and it was absolutely awesome!This time I came with my 12 year old daughter and she loved it too.When you plan your visit to London, try to clear couple of hours, go and enjoy this wonderful place.It is very easy to get to the market by the Tube. You need to go to London Bridge Station (once ther, use the Borough High Street exit at the station) and the market is just 2 minutes away.The market opens daily (closed on Sundays), Mon-Wed 10am-3pm, Thursday 11am-5pm, Fri 12pm-6pm and Saturday 8am-5pm. Be aware that on weekends during lunch it gets very busy, but it's a great atmosphere.The variety of foods is outstanding. Fruits, vegetables (the tomato stand, OMG), many stands that sell huge sausages (hotdogs if you insist, but not the one you think..), sandwiches, oysters, cheese, cakes, natural juices, hot cider (with or without alcohol) – are you hungry yet??One of the best experiences at this market (for me) is the stand that has a "melting" machine, and you can see how a huge piece of cheese is melting right in front of you and they literally pour the cheese on a beef sandwich or on a baked potato – Yummy!So, if you into trying new and authentic tastes, or if just love good food, don't miss this place!||July 18, 2013
HRHCaoimhe||50||This treat was very close by the Old Operating Theater which we spent the morning at. The market is amazing and I am so glad I saw it in the TripAdvisor 'things to do'. It is an open air market that is under a roof and just full of stalls selling the most amazing produce and breads and cooked food, stalls of different olives, and one stall of different licorices. Just amazing and something for all tastes. There are places that have the larges woks I have ever seen full of curries etc. And there is a place that has the best grilled cheese sandwiches with onions and leeks. What at treat!! My husband and I split a grilled cheese sandwich and had a lovely bowl of olives from one of the stalls. I would love to live near by and go here to shop! Just full of people but seemed to flow well and you were able to stop and sample or shop without feeling pressured at all. A wonderful find!||July 17, 2013
ElizabethV646||50||While studying abroad in London, my school group and I went to the Borough Market probably 10 times for lunch- IT. WAS. THAT. GOOD.The food is absolutely amazing and I encourage ANYONE who will be in London to go have lunch/snack/brunch/any-meal-you-can there. The salt beef sandwich is the best I've ever had. The grilled cheese is TO DIE FOR. The paella was very good. Basically, I didn't try anything that wasn't WAY above par. It can be a little crowded during lunch hour, as it seems that lots of people working in downtown London go to eat there, but it is SO worth it!||July 17, 2013
thechoos||50||this is a place not to be missed when you are in london. its conveniently located outside across from the london bridge underground and so easy to find!!plan on spending your whole day there because its a culinary adventure!! there is a 'farmer' market on certain days where you can find all the unimaginable desserts, meats, and exotic foods!!||July 16, 2013
alsyli||50||One of my favorite parts of London. A friend suggested we meet here, and it was a lovely afternoon of wandering around the almost overwhelming number of stalls. We had lunch at Cafe Brood (which was astonishingly hard to find b/c the listed address doesn't map correctly) and had delicious seafood paella. Then walked around the stalls (which puts the farmer's markets in my native LA to shame). My favorite place was the stall w/ imported proscuiotto, which my partner and I enjoyed later as we walked around Whitehall. Almost all the stalls offered samples to try, and you can easily spend a few hours here.||July 15, 2013
Family8travels||50||I read the great review about Borough Market and so made a stop there on a Friday. Must say I was not disappointed. Great market with lots of yummy food. Many of the stalls also provide free samples which was really great! It was pretty busy but we were still able to comfortably navigate the market with our stroller (just a couple spots where it was a bit tight). Such a great selection - cheese, spices, meats, pastries, pies, olives etc. Based on the reviews we ended up going to Monmouth Coffee, there was barely a line up when we went which was nice but the coffee while was good (strong but not bitter), wasn't necessarily special. Had a grilled cheese sandwich from Kappacaesin which was really tasty and I highly recommend it. Had the chorizo sandwich from Brindisa, it was good but I didn't think it was amazing. Also had oysters at Richard Haywards and it was yummy. There are 3 options - small, medium or large rock oysters. I did not try the large but had the small and medium, personally preferred the small as it had more flavor. We missed out eating at Roast (as we were full but am now totally disappointed) but the line up was quite long and the food looked really good. Great place to visit and I highly recommend it, just be prepared for crowds and lines.||July 15, 2013
daveb388||50||Had an amazing day with friends walking from stall to stall. We had gone for lunch, but having sampled a multitude of different cheeses, meats, breads and giant delicious cherries it became harder and harder to choose what to have. Spoilt for choice. The most fun way I've found in London to find something reasonably priced to eat. The real highlight though was the Spice Mountain stall. So many different spices and ready made mixes for any type of meal with experts on hand to offer excellent advice on what to try in your cooking. I wasn't overly confident cooking with spices before but I now have a much wider range of signature dishes to impress friends with. You must visit these guys.||July 13, 2013
KeoweeGal||50||This market was so enjoyable for our family, we had a great time sampling food and walking around. Most of it is covered, so go even if it's raining! ||July 13, 2013
evyRomsey||50||So many wonderful stalls, cafes, bars and restaurants - had iced chocolate drink and delicious chocolate brownie in The Rabot Estate Chocolate Café, really tasty BBQ pulled pork bap from Hobbs Meat Roast and scrumptious parmesan cheese from the Ham & Cheese Company - finished with a very refreshing smoothie containing wheatgrass, orange, lime, banana and apple. So easy to visit from Waterloo - just catch the train from Waterloo East for £2.50 (single) and you're there in a couple of mins; really pleasant walk back along the river with lots to see.Can't wait to go back.||July 13, 2013
Valentyn K||50||Really one of the most emotional places with unique mix of food, fun and new experience. A must visit, but be informed - it's closed on Sunday and less active on Mo-We, with peak load on Saturday.||July 13, 2013
Sandiejc||40||Fantastic food market lovely atmosphere photographers paradise just love it! Take plenty of moneyas you will want to buy it all pricey bit lovely you will come home with longer arms!!||July 12, 2013
dahlia8||50||This is where I go to lunch when I'm in London. I head straight for the duck confit sandwiches. Heavenly. This time around they had some delicious apple orange sangria. The produce, food, cheeses and meats look and smell fresh. If I had a place I could cook I would definitely buy my foods from here.||July 11, 2013
Lou W||50||This huge market is a food lovers dream! Bread, olives, flowers, cheese, cakes, fruit, chocolate and much more! If on holidays visit at the beginning of your stay to stock up on well priced good quality food! The hardest bit is to decide what you'll have!||July 11, 2013
Mumble_Swerve||50||Absolutely gorgeous food and drink on sale at the market. From artisan breads to extenive seafood. I could spend alot of money there on breads, cheeses, cold meats, pies, wine, cakes, biscuits and sweets. ||July 11, 2013
WelshMaiden_8||50||Every time we go to London we HAVE to go to Borough Market. It is a must visit place and is only a short walk from London Bridge underground station. Allow yourself two hours or more because the enormous variety of food here will have your mouth watering and wanting to try everything in sight. There are products from all over the UK and Europe and many stalls let you taste their wares, e.g. salami, sausages, cheese. There are also some great stalls cooking food to tempt you and some are so popular they have long queues, but are worth the wait. If you want to sit down and eat then the market is surrounded by a variety of restaurants and pubs all selling food. This market is split into two by a very narrow side street, so don't miss all of it. It is just such a wonderful place to browse and be amazed at such things like how many types of mushrooms there are on sale! Don't miss these markets then afterwards you can walk along the Thames to the London Eye for some exercise. Check for opening times.||July 10, 2013
JoBoxer555||40||We stayed in Southwark, at the Holiday Inn, and were just taking a walk to get acquainted with the area,and were lucky enough to stumble upon the market, which is very close to the hotel. I'd read about the market,and we planned to go the next day, as we had just landed that morning. It turned into a happy accident!There's an amazing amount of food, baked goods, fruits and vegetables, as well as places to get food to eat. We took some muffins and cookies back to our room,to enjoy later. Everything we bought was good. There are also fish and chips restaurants on the fringe of the market, and more.You can also get dishes, crockery, and kitchen items in the different stalls. We bought a small water color note card of the main entrance of the market, and have since framed it,and put it on our kitchen; a great reminder of a our enjoyable visits to Borough MarketWorth a visit!.||July 10, 2013
Alfiewhitestar||50||What a day you could spend a week there and not see it all. There must be over 50 types of tomato's,the tea stall I could of spent up quite easily. They were advertising a New Forrest cider stall it was brill. Great day out ||July 10, 2013
Jeanne0113||50||From the outside it looks like a department store. Once you walk in, you are in a totally different wonderful world.||July 10, 2013
fourends||50||I had eaten one of the famous Borough Market toasted cheese sandwiches on my last trip to London, and then it was featured when the Today Show covered the London Olympics. I wanted my husband to experience it, so it was our first stop. I was hoping it would be as creamy, chewy and savory as I had remembered, and I was not disappointed. The leeks and onion added at the end, and the chewy sour dough bread make it an experience worth repeating - over and over again. Warning - It is extremely rich - Unless you have a huge appetite, share it with a friend.||July 10, 2013
zoro1985||50||Borough should be experience by everyone, locals and tourist alike. It has excellent cafe's, restaurants, bars with character and local brews, as well as some fantastic market stall selling everything from fine cuts of meat to bakeries to novelty jams. If you don't have time for sitting in a restaurant there are plenty of street-food type stalls where you can get excellent food. Couple the quality of the business' with the charming arcitechure of the market, it's got an old-london feel about it amongst archways and the sounds of commuter trains overhead. This is a market with not just london character, but excellent quality to match.The market is open Monday to Saturday, but only properly comes alive towards the end of the week, to get the full experience go on a Saturday, but be warned it can get very busy in the afternoon.Tip: If your after some quality meat and knock-down prices... you could risk going at the end of the day, I've seen traders offering goods at half-price around 5.30 on a Saturday as they need to clear the stock.||July 8, 2013
jmteno76||50||One of my favorite places for photography and eating is Borough Market. It is true delight of cheeses and breads. I could spend hours. Highly recommend. ||July 5, 2013
Dan C||50||Each market we visited in the London area had its own signature. The Borough Market is a gourmet destination (wine, fresh produce, cheeses, surrounding restaurants, meats,...). High end mostly but a one stop shop for foodies.||July 5, 2013
JohnDoe55423||50||We have visited 3 food markets and this one is the one worth visiting if you have time for only 1. Nice fresh food next to the river and surrounded by really nice pubs. Had the best Chorizo sandwich in my life in this market. Highly reccomendable.||July 5, 2013
Tracey G||50||Went early Saturday morning before the crowds. This market is a foodie's heaven. Go and have an early morning breakfast, there is great pastries and coffee...pick up some treats for later and head to the Tower of London before the crowds. I believe it is also on a Wednesday.||July 1, 2013
osalinda||50||I have lived in London for six years, and can't believe I didn't visit this place sooner! You can access it from London Bridge station, or for a short walk, you can alight at Monument station and walk across the bridge. It sits in the shade of Southwark Cathedral, and in my mind is largely split into two.There is a more whole food area, where you can buy things to take away (meats, cheeses, wines) and a more exciting "ready to eat" area, which is more hustling and bustling. Here you can buy foods such as Thai, Arabic, German, French, Spanish... with a very healthy dose of bakery related goodies. Part of the charm is that you can just buy something and eat it right there and then wander to the next stall to try something new.I came away after eating a vension sausage burger, a summer burger, a gluten and dairy free brownie and with a wonderful smoothie. The total cost we spent was £20 between us, which is not bad at all!Definitely worth a visit! Lots of things to nibble on and try, and plenty of food artistic photography to be had!!!||July 1, 2013
anettambrus||40||It is a very nice food market based in the centre of London. You can find amazing products here, nice street food from many places around the world, fresh meat and bakery products. However, I was a bit disappointed because I didn't find the same variety and scale of vegetables and fruits as in other markets and also found them a bit expensive compared to other prices.||July 1, 2013
thaifishcakes||50||I work near here and never get tired of it. The recent developments and constant innovation mean it's a pleasure to visit over and over again. Monmouth coffee, Neal's Yard Dairy, the best empanadas and all the other usuals mean that there's always something worthy to eat or drink there and then or to take home for later.||June 30, 2013
PhilSmith_11||50||We always go when in London; just to wander round with Southwark Cathedral watching over us. We are definitely having more food there next time given the choice. If you haven't been, just go, you won't be dissapointed.||June 30, 2013
mikeyHongKong||50||What a fantastic culinary experience. From fish n chips to paella to chorizo to every kind of cheese. Darjeeling teas - the owner is very entertaining. Most if not all vendors very polite and helpful. Many stalls offer free samples. My own preference was the salt beef bagel but the veggie burgers were also very popular.||June 30, 2013
yashgupta25||50||This is basically like a farmers market where you'll find practically everything under the sun to eat. in short, this is Foodie Heaven. There will be basic items like fish and chips to exotic crocodile and ostrich burgers. The market get extremely crowded during noon on the weekends. But some of the stalls are only open on the weekends / holidays. A definite must visit for all food lovers in London.||June 29, 2013
R6637BK||50||This is not on the usual tourist list of things to see but it is great. We visited on a Thursday. There is everything, both local produce and unusual imported items e.g. fruit, vegetables, oils, teas, ciders, sweets, patisserie, fish and meat. We browsed around the stalls then bought hot food for lunch which was delicious and very good value. We would go again.||June 29, 2013
1happymum||50||The variety of produce was amazing. The place was buzzing and I spent far too much money as there was so choice and plenty of tasters!!There is also a wide range of eateries in the locality if you still have room for more food.||June 28, 2013
DavidMesquita||40||This market is all about food. Either to consume there and then or to take it home to savour. There are also some nice places for drinks from pims, cava to healthy fruit juices and lots of coffee places with "baristas". My favourite are the pork belly rool, so so good with crackling and apple sauce. The bread stalls are very good as well although obviously the bread is so fresh and chemical free it does not last anywhere near as long as the super market, but its infinitely better. I have also bough meat from butchers which are high quality. A very good market to go to the only down side is the price, it is an expensive market just like most of London things.||June 28, 2013
Tina_ZH||40||I went there for lunch on a Wednesday - not all stalls were open but a few were. I was already fascinated by them so I am really looking forward to going back there on a Saturday. The atmosphere was laid back, people grabbing a drink or a sandwich or a freshly prepared bowl of Paella. It's situated near London Bridge in Zone 1. Really worth a visit!||June 25, 2013
Loulwa_Kaloyeros||50||I love visiting markets! Borough market is fun, interesting and varied, not only British but also Spanish, Italian and much more. The food stalls are neat and attractive and there is a lot to try. Having food on site is a big feature of this market, fresh oysters at the stall, fish and chips to die for and lots of other options. Crockery and cutlery have a specialty stall and worth looking for the odd piece.||June 24, 2013
onefliesoneswims||50||A London must experience and must eat. On a Saturday it is simply buzzing. Yes, its very very busy but that's the attraction, so much food to choose from and all excellent quality. Roast do amazing takeaway Pork Belly; the Salt beef in bagels are also devine. The chocolate shop under the bridge on the roadside does amazing hot chocolate (even if service is slow) and the pub next door is simply fab for a pint on a wet Saturday afternoon (and we have many of them). Oh and there is a great cake stall in the middle of the market.... great cheese, juices, tipple... lol just visit. And its perfect if visiting many of the London bridge attractions. (Have visited as a couple and with kids (9 & 11) in tow prob not so suitable for younger children due to the crowds and but still liked it; perfect with just adults to wander eat and drink).||June 24, 2013
LaNyonsaise||50||This is foodie heaven with lots of specialist stalls offering samples of their wares and street food 'to go'. There are lots of places to get a drink too.The fresh fish, meat and produce were very tempting but sadly impossible to buy when staying in a hotel. Prices were much higher, though, than those seen outside London.||June 24, 2013
Niall||50||Heard about it and did not know what to expect, thought I might see Oliver Twist selling something. Had a walk around the place, full of history and any food you might want, the stalls were amazing. Place was packed and buzzing. Had a brilliant crispy duck in a bun, the earliest I ever ate duck!!!! The queue or line for the coffee shop was huge......one of many places to get coffee. An attraction for tourists but a huge amount of locals buying their fruit and veg. A really nice place to experience.||June 24, 2013
peggiT||50||all you have to do is name the cuisine you feel like eating and voila! you'd find it there! I personally had the Roast Hog sandwich with apple sauce and salad... one word - A.W.E.S.O.M.E......! the vendors even thought they deal with so many tourists a day, was so accommodating, I basically managed to sample almost 80% of the fare there was to offer... absolute MUST if you live and love food like myself.||June 24, 2013
Mrs-B-loves||50||What can I say. This market is fantastic the food available is great quality and from all over the world. If you visit bring a cool bag as there are many wonderful cheeses, seafood and meats that you will want to buy if you are a food lover like me!||June 24, 2013
Chakphim||50||We visit london at least once every year but had never been to this market before, well in future I think we will come here every time it's a foodies paradise I tried a hot salt beef bagel, seafood paella and a duck sandwich all delicious if I could have eaten more things I would have, this place is a must for people who love food and drink||June 23, 2013
RedSaphire||50||We love our food, and this place sells everything from Olives, Cheeses, Meats, to pastries, breads, chocolate and turkish delight. It also has large fresh vegatable stalls, fresh squeezed fruit juices and smoothies. The food here was delicious and we purchased a few bits to take home. If we lived nearby we would definitely use this as our regular market. We loved the different cultures and foods from around the world, reminding us of lovely holidays in Spain and so on. Worth a look either for lunch or for taking something home at the end of the day. Today watching a cooking programme we saw that Gordon Ramsey shops for some of his fresh produce at this market, so they must know what they are talking about :-)||June 23, 2013
laineybear||50||Really enjoyed my visit to Borough Market. Travelled by tube and the market is right in front of you so easy accessible! Every kind of bread, mushrooms, pasta, asparagus smoothies you could think of plus lots more. Well worth a visit.||June 23, 2013
LisaR488||50||Great, lively and atmospheric spot, for a Friday lunch date, if you work at London Bridge, or, its environs, and it's a bit less crowded on Fridays, ( although still vv busy!). Equally, it's a g8 spot Sat morning for breakfast ( I'm not sharing our favourite place; anyway, there's so many places to choose from!). We love it after a long run, or walk, on the Southbank; a real treat to sit and relax and have breakfast/ lunch, and enjoy the world go by, in the busy hustle & bustle of a food market. Yummy fresh food from all over Europe, and great take out: oysters, organic burgers, smoothies etc. Nice restaurants too. Highly recommend, but, if you're not a fan of crowds, suggest go Fridays, or, earlier Saturday morning.||June 23, 2013
KevinLondon||50||Took some guests from America here they loved it, a great place if a little busy now. The whole area has a really rustic feel but at the same time is very cutting edge, actually quite an original old part of London with the Shard just behind it.The food is fantastic and the choice is amazing.A great place to enjoy a beer during the summer.Enjoy!||June 22, 2013
HQComics||50||The Borough Market is near the London Bridge and has an awesome selection of vendors...Everyone can get something different to eat depending on their preferences (Fish and chips, Indian, Thai, Sausage, Meat Pies, Chinese, Mexican, Burgers, Vegetarian...)....About a half a dozen cheese vendors, with some wheels of cheese being 2 to 3 feet in diameter...one of the best beer vendors that I ever saw with an impressive selection of over 200 varieties from around the world...right next to an equally impressive wine vendor...If or when there is not a place to find to sit and eat...the locals just stand. We found a place a 100 feet away at the Southwark Cathedral with a bench that could sit all 5 of us...Then after we ate, we went inside the church that many famous people (including Shakespeare) where said to have gone. The church was very old and impressive...Right around from the church is the Globe Theater, and next to that is the Millennium Bridge (a suspension foot bridge) that will take you over the river Thames, and drop you out in front of the St Paul's Church....London is awesome with all the public transportation...with Tube and Train stations located all over, and buses running constantly....Get yourself an 'Oyster card' and you can ride all 3 with just the 1 card, and you can add more money to the card as needed at tons of locations including the stations themselves and store vendors that have the Oyster logos on them...There is so much to see and do in London...so pace yourselves....||June 22, 2013
LaFlamaBlanca17||50||1. Try the duck sandiwich served on a foccacia roll located at the entrance to borough market by monmouth coffee shop. 2. Try the spicy chorizo sandwich also located near monmouth coffee shop.3. Try the raclette, served over a baked potato, at the other entrance to borough market neat the falaffal stand. 4. Try the mushroom pate (all vegetarian) made fresh weekly - my sister made me bring some back to the us for her!!!5. If it's there when you visit tried the biltong booth (south african style of dried/cured meats - heavenly)6. Sample sample sample....great food, great prices, great atmosphere, try some sangria, hot cider in the winter along with spiced wine, or a nice lager on a hot summer day||June 22, 2013
PortDouglasHugo||50||This place has an amazing array of foods literally from a -z with cinnamon and chocolate covered Almonds to Zebra meat burger patties. If you are staying in London DO NOT miss this most stalls have free samples of their foods the quality of the foods was exceptional. I would not say it was the cheapest food I have ever seen but worth the money. We are definitely going again before we leave. Open thurs,fri, and Saturday||June 21, 2013
dougill88||50||Just round the corner from London bridge tube, this market is well worth a visit. So much choice, you pick what you're going to have, then change your mind every few yards when something else catches your eye! Its good fun and gets busy but just go with the flow. I had a steak sandwich and also tried the paella a bit later, both were very good. I'll definitely return, everything looks and smells great.||June 21, 2013
Greekislandlovers||50||This is well worth a visit when you are in London. The most amazing selection of food stalls, the highest quality, we were very lucky to be staying close by, and visited twice. It is situated in a lovely area close to the river, close to London Bridge Tube.||June 21, 2013
Amy M||50||This market has everything. Beautiful produce, artisan cheese and bread, turkish delights.....everything. I've never sampled so many delicious things. Don't miss the gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches....they are to die for.||June 20, 2013
Jani L||40||Whether you are in to all kinds of food or not but this place is a must visit if you are around London Bridge. Lively place with all kinds of people and food where you can feel the old times touching the modern era.Food looked fantastic and chiapattas we bought were excellent.||June 20, 2013
ms12341||50||The most amazing food market! Central and easy to get to. AMAZING range of all types of foods. Most stalls have things to taste for free... do a couple of rounds and you have a good meal. But beware - you won't be able to stop yourself from spendinga whole lotta dosh... the stuff is amazing and irresistable!!||June 19, 2013
EdinburghChaz||40||If you are anywhere near London Bridge station then this is a must.Lots of charactor & a great local pub the market porter.I am led to believe this is where the film Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels was filmed||June 19, 2013
Kathy C||50||Be sure to go hungry to the Borough Market! There were so many interesting and delicious foods available! We loved wandering around the stalls and tasting different products.||June 18, 2013
kokonuk||50||My husband and I came to this market on a Saturday morning and ate something light because we read so much reviews about this place being a food haven. And we were still amazed by what we saw! Endless selection of cheese, wonderful variety of fresh seafood (no option to cook them and eat on the spot though), and so many stalls selling pies, bread, burgers and sweets. We had a venison burger (super yummy), Mrs Kings' pork pie which is supposedly ranked #1 at some competition (thumbs up), stir-fried scallops (5 pounds for 3 which came with some vege), and duck pulled sandwich. And copious amounts of sangria and cider. And cheese. It was such fun to walk around, but I allocated too much time - we were done with the place in about 1.5hours, and I gave myself 3 hours! Maybe you will need more time to browse around, but I was walking and eating and queuing and shopping and 1.5 hours was about right. Its a sheltered place, so even if it drizzles or rains, it will be fine : - )||June 18, 2013
Alexander C||50||I visited with my Wife and we had breakfast which was simple but very tasty.There is a wide variety of stalls selling condiments (which we purchased) and also cheeses and wines and also tasty confectionary.The setting is superb and atmospheric (just what we expected).Well worth a visit.||June 17, 2013
sbspeedo1||50||A trip to Borough market is so tasty! So many choices of food, really well prepared. We had a felafel wrap, and a salt beef bagel, roast pork roll, and a pie - all seriously delicious. And the pastries for dessert! Wow!Busy as it was a saturday, but had died down a bit by 2pm when we got there. Best London food experience!||June 16, 2013
GirlonfireStudio||50||because this market is amazing. We went around 11 and it was just waking up. The duck confit vendor was super generous and if you like milk, you must try a glass of raw milk sold for 1 pound.||June 16, 2013
hbomb67||50||What a hive of lovely smells and sets off your imagination. a must for allAnd has everything and the food is lovely. ||June 15, 2013
Pam M||50||Wander along the Thames from the Tate Modern, past the New Globe Theatre and Southwark Cathedral (built in 1220) to the Borough Market. The aromas from the countless food stalls create a tantalizing atmosphere to grab a quick meal or to linger and people-watch, or take in the countless food stalls. For those who are gluten-free (like me), this is a fantasy land. I devoured a spicy lentil crepe filled with a flavorful potato masala, with a delightfully complex mixture of chickpeas, yogurt and pomegranate seeds on the side. After lunch, I wandered a bit and found ginormous meringue cookies, crispy on the outside, creamy in the middle and with enough sugar to keep you buzzed for the rest of the day! If you want something different, away from tourists and absolutely fascinating, plan a visit.||June 15, 2013
Robtoon84||50||An absolute assault on the senses! Set in a fantastic Victorian "under the railway" location next to the Cathedral this market is an complete delight and should only be visited when you have time to wander at leisure and frequently stand and stare! Spices, cheeses,and beautiful veg stalls rub shoulders with butchers, fishmongers and hot and cold food stalls. Wine, cider, and beer vendors compete with a range of wonderful health drink and smoothie sellers!! A real eclectic mix of gourmet delights encourage sound foody investments and gourmet impulse purchases. Take time to shop as there are bargains to be had and while you can easily spend a fortune you can also shop sensibly. Completely destroys the urge to ever go to a supermarket again. A must go to experience.||June 15, 2013
LouJo255||50||Every time I'm in London a trip to Borough Market is a must. It's got everything you could think of food-wise including fresh produce, bakery items, great cheese and hot food with a definite international flavour. It's so central as well that it's a great place to start your day of sightseeing. A word of note though, at the weekends it does become particularly busy with tourists so you can find yourself in a never ending walking conga line, so go early or go midweek.||June 12, 2013
Alan C||50||I took my daughter for an al fresco lunch to the market and even she, being a very fussy eater enjoyed a hand held lunch. She chose roast hog in a ciabatta roll plain, no apple sauce or salad and she consumed the lot!I was more confused and after settling on a paella, the stall holder served another queue jumper first so I walked away as the choice of food is vast and had a burghito, very nicely presented and five pounds well spent.We then spent some time looking around the market, it was nice and quiet being a Monday, see website as not all stalls trade everyday. With a travelcard in my pocket the time was well spent sampling wares from various stalls, we came away with some black forest salami, some beautiful cakes and a chunk of Italian cheese, I would have bought more especially if the oyster stall would have been trading and I now have an incredible hankering to visit "Roast" but might need to set some funds aside!!Lovely ambiance and difficult to believe you are in an English market! Can't wait to go again soon.||June 12, 2013
Stv_Lee||50||It's fortunate that I live very close to here - I visit Borough market every week and it never fails to disappoint me. Virtually every range of the foods found here are of top qualities, and some of them are one of the best to be found in London. I especially love the fruit stalls here - it's sometimes a good deal cheaper than Tesco nearby. Just make sure you don't go there on Saturday afternoon. It's real hassle (so I recommend going there on weekdays)||June 12, 2013
Londontraveller649||40||It was an interesting place to visit and very very busy, ideal place to find something different to eat||June 12, 2013
julie l||50||We love Borough Market and whenever we visit London its a must!Its easy to spend a day here especially on a Saturday when there is a large number of stalls and a real buzz about the place. Everybody selling is so proud of there produce and happy to offer little tasting bites before you buy.There is some unusual produce which just makes it even more interesting. We cannot wait for our next trip to London and visit to the market.||June 12, 2013
--Rom--210--||40||This market is really good. You can find some really good food products like cheese, fish, meat, rare Greek, French, Turkish and generally European products.There are also many many things to eat there (like fast food) such as burgers and fish and chips but also muffins and chocolate.It can become quite busy so be prepared for a not so comfortable walk but other than that it is just great and just 2 minutes from London Bridge underground station. ||June 10, 2013
Simon C||50||I am moving away from UK soon and will miss this gem in the heart of London. I have been visiting the market for 17 years and the smells, sights and sounds are unbeatable, making it an all round fantastic few hours roaming round the numerous unique stalls.||June 10, 2013
FreakinSweet||50||Go down on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday for a full on assault of the senses. There's so much variety on offer you won't know where to start!It gets very busy around lunchtime and I had a hard time deciding what to try first. So many stalls offering local and international goodies from enormous sandwiches, rolls and baguettes to freshly cooked authentic dishes from around the world. There's cheese stalls, bread stalls, olive oil, beer and cider, fresh fruit and vegetables, British charcuterie, seafood and so much more.||June 9, 2013
Intavia||50||We passed through the market on our way from The Shard to the Oxo Tower and I was enchanted. A narrow bustling market full of so many smells of wonderful food and produce. Almost every stall offers free tasters and everything is locally produced and different. It was very busy on the Saturday we visited, but I loved the sights, sounds and smells and was only disappointed to find it packing up at 5pm on our way back to London Bridge station when we had more time and I would have bought something to take home.||June 9, 2013
princewobblebottom||50||I must admit we only went here because we were looking for an antique market after going up the Shard, so thought we'd have a look as it was just round the corner, none of our party had ever heard of it! Outstanding quality food to buy and eat, and good prices too according to swmbo. In some ways I'm glad I don't live too near as I'd be as fat as a barrel after a week of lunches! I live in a rural area and this place makes me very jealous of city people. Highly recommended and I will visit again next time I'm in London.||June 8, 2013
VATraveler003||50||A wander around Borough Market is a wonderful way to spend a few hours, tasting samples as you go. Cheese, meats, flowers, teas and coffees on offer all present danger to your wallet, but prices are quite reasonable. However, the best way to enjoy is to plan on a bit of a nibble party later, whether at your flat or hotel. SInce only a knife is needed its easy to eat later. I bought an amazing Welsh cheddar from TeiFi, matched with a rich Parmasean from The Ham and Cheese Company. Samples of course give you a taste of your future snack but even better was talking with the vendors about where their good originated from. For a bit of fun, I added a few sausages (Venison, Boar and Spicy) from Exquisite Deli, which were wonderful. In total I spent less than £20 for two cheeses, three sausages, an a large chibiatta bread. Most of these vendors have websites as well.The tea vendors were terribly convincing, but I resisted the aroma's and tastes, but you might choose differently ( or grab a bottle of wine :-) ).Hot food can be had from a variety of stalls and the FISH restaurant, but why go prepared food when you can grab a sandwich, and some nibbles for later?Very easy to get to from London Bridge tube stop (literally its across the street) and well worth the visit. Oh and the fish market seemed to be a hit with the kids, looking at all the fresh goods on ice.||June 8, 2013
Wrappo||50||Borough Market is a must for all visitors especially on a Thursday Friday or Saturday. You can buy or view some excellent ingredients and sample classy cheeses, oils and breads. The pubs are great and each have unique stories. It is adjacent to many other great attractions and is free to visit and is part of the South Bank which is one of the finest walks anywhere||June 7, 2013
Theresa H||50||This market was mostly food, wines, beers and cheeses. We loved to walk around and sample and we also ate there twice, lunch one day and dinner another. Really fun atmosphere. Wish we had something like this near where we live.||June 7, 2013
RichyBlood||50||My wife & I visited Borough Market last month and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The sights, sounds, smells & stalls were all wonderful, and despite the place being very busy (which is always a good sign!) we spent hours meandering around, buying & eating & drinking many delicious goodies on sale. Roll on next time!!!||June 6, 2013
h1990||50||I have been on a few occasions so thought it was time to give a little review on TA. I can highly recommend the duck sarnies. Nom nom, just feel hungry thinking about them. Good selection of amazing foods and I would highly recommend a visit to anyone who loves food! We went on a Saturday and it was really busy but hey what can you expect!||June 5, 2013
SRinRVA||50||I loved this place so much, I visited twice on my recent stay in London. There were simply too many good things to try in one visit (I could probably make 50 visits and not try everything I wanted). Delicious grilled meats on baguettes with interesting sauces and vegetables, raclette served over potatoes with a side of gherkins, fresh bakery items all over, sausages, mustards, cheeses, olives, cider, wine - the list is unending. Just go. Both of my visits were during the week, so if you can't make it on a Saturday morning, don't fret - they have a ton of food and crowds even at lunch time during the week.||June 5, 2013
karateski||50||My wife and I were in London for the weekend to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and one of her wishes was to visit Borough market. I reluctantly agreed to go .......I am so glad I did as it was a fantastic place. The stalls were a wonderful treat for the senses with a huge variety of foods from near and far ! The Champagne bar also helped as it was after all our anniversary and what better way to start the celebrations.I would strongly recommend a visit to Borough market it is fantastic !||June 5, 2013
TheInformer||40||A great place to mill around and see what fantastic foods you can buy. We sampled some cider which was rather strong!! Bought some beautiful bread to take home with us. You could spend a small fortune, as the market has so much to offer.||June 5, 2013
MeghanSweet||50||Try to get there early, before 9am. Awesome market - huge selection of items. One of our favorites was the licorice vendor (see pics) - some of the best we've tasted. Hoping to find a way to order some now that we're home!||June 2, 2013
Spursgirl13||30||It is crazy as on Saturdays but a delight if you have the patiences to look around properly. To many rubbish piles. Great variety of stalls if you could get to them. As a suffer of wheat intolerance I was very happy to find a hidden gem of a gluten free stall.||June 2, 2013
Shanti M||40||We crossed Tower Bridge and walked along the south bank of the Thames to London Bridge and Borough Market, stopping at Southwark Cathedral. Don't miss the toasted melted cheese sandwich with leeks. Sharp cheese and fragrant leeks!. My daughter had the raclette which was good but the sandwich was better. Walk through the market and see the different kinds of mushrooms and tomatoes sold as also the exotic fruit. We had goat's milk icecream, great for those of us who are lactose intolerant. The chocolate was fabulous as also the raspberry chili. Try the different chutneys and the handpainted ceramic ware. When you convert into USD the food and drinks are more expensive than what you would normally pay in the US, even in the more expensive outdoor food stalls.||June 2, 2013
Bett76||50||I've live in London for about a year, I have gone to the Borough Market 3 or 4 times. This place for me is magical. I love to cook, I love to eat, so this food market just makes me very happy.It gets very crowded on Saturdays, so if you are just visiting and you are here on a Friday, better to go that day. However, the atmosphere on Saturday is amazing. I have spent a whole day there, doing my weekly shopping for veggies, buying olive oil, eating whatever is there (Argentinean empanadas, German sausages, French sandwiches, Duck, wine, lots of wine, Chocolate, macaroons, Spanish hams, Italian cheese, what not to find!!!).It is a great plan, but beware, you can end up spending a lot without noticing it. It is 100% recommended, something everyone must see while in London.||June 2, 2013
Lindyla||50||I'm really lucky as I live quite close to the market and use it all the time, the green market (fruit & veg) is open all week and the rest of the market Fri,Sat and sunday. Its a heavenly delight for foodies... Some of the best bread in London can be bought here, the best day to go is a Friday its not to crowded I would never go on a sat or sun its to manic. Stall holders are always happy to chat to you about the produce and you can have tasters as well. New Forest Cider have a great stall and are worth a visit for the hot cider! There are lots of restaurants in the area and good pubs as well and your are a short walk from Tate modern and all of the South Bank... Keep the Thames to your right and walk down to the London Eye & Houses of Parliament.. Happy Shopping||June 1, 2013
StevenN305||50||Headed here just before lunch and wow was amazed, the food on offer was outstanding and washed down with a number of different tipples made this one of my favourite places in London!I would recommend EVERYONE to go visit, do what we did and try as much as you can (we bought single portions and asked the freindly people to cut it into thirds so we had little mouthfuls each!) In the end we must have tried 10 different things and washed it down with 4 or 5 different drinks.A really friendly buzzing atmosphere too, best way to grab lunch a enjoy a couple of hours.||May 31, 2013
gabriel_syme||50||We went by during our stay in London on a Saturday, and the place (the whole extent of it) was packed full of people - in some places such that you really had to just move with the flow of the crowd (you'll understand what I mean if you've ever experienced that). Without knowing much of what to expect, it was a slight surprise that there were many stalls that seemed permanent/semi-permanent, probably because the closest thing we have here to a 'market' is our local farmers market, which is only tents/canopies in a parking lot. As others point out, there's tons (probably literally) of food, with really good choices especially if you appreciate Italian options, and it seemed like there were many different artisanal cheese, meat, bread and pastry type foods available (not to mention the expected seafood, vegetables, etc). Personally, I purchased a panino (can't remember the vendor's name) which was very similar to those I've had in Italy, and my wife had a tomato-artichoke kind of salad (olive oil-based) which she loved, along with some kind of fruit smoothie (also delicious). Also New Forest ciders are there, which has its own separate review. I wasn't expecting too much of an experience in going there, but it was well worth doing, and different from everything else on our trip. Very easy to get to via the tube, and relatively close to other sightseeing options (e.g., Shakespeare's Globe theatre, Tate Modern, etc.). If we actually lived around the area, this would be a regular place to visit for us.||May 31, 2013
Eyal A||50||Colorful food market near London Bridge. On Saturday there is varied cuisine with Meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, Omelets, cheese, Organic foods, wine, juices and more.Place very kindly. Highly recommended!||May 31, 2013
Lwise55||40||We happend to go on a day when most of it was closed so will go back. lots of great food and smells and cheese samples!||May 29, 2013
LenBrownB||50||You must go to this place if you enjoy good food. It's always busy and buzzing, so don't go if you don't like crowds. The stalls sell a fabulous range of produce and whilst we normally book a restaurant nearby there is plenty to eat actually in the market. Applebee's is worth a visit though. ||May 28, 2013
Loudnorthernbird||40||Don't eat beforehand! loads of free samples. Take an empty bag to bring all your purchases home! A wonderful selection of foods, from beautiful breakfast cereals, cakes, breads and cheese...so much yummy cheese! meats and the list goes on. If you are in London and want to eat well, there are many good cafes etc. But if you want to try some lush takeway-you'll have a great selection to choose from. From want we saw and tried-all very nice, not mass produced rubbish. But food with flavour!||May 28, 2013
Bomtotheworld||40||We went on a thursday afternoon and it was a delightful market with a variety of food - lots of cheese and sausages - but also lovely baked treats and heaps of free sampling ! We had a lovely meal at Fish! and then walked around the market picking up dessert and some Deli food to take back.||May 27, 2013
Bunny7475||50||I've been wanting to go to this market since seeing it on the food channel years ago. It did not disappoint. It was literally my first stop in London and in my 7 days there I went 4 times, so that should tell you how much I enjoyed it. Highlights include Maria's Market Cafe for a genuine English breakfast, the duck sandwich at Le Marché du Quartier, the chorizo sandwich at Brindisa, fish and chips at fish! take-away (expensive but good) and lots and lots of Pimm's punch from a wine seller that I sadly neglected to get the name of. I really can't recommend it highly enough. I wish I was there right now.||May 27, 2013
pshampshire||30||Popped to borough Market on a Saturday but were disappointed. We had been before but this time there seemed less variety. Whether this is a product of the hype is unclear but there were no English cheeses, very few pastries, no sweets. The street food is good but be prepared to queue. There is a buzz about the place but with so much specialist food available everywhere it isn't as special as it was.||May 27, 2013
onyerbikeYork||50||Had heard of, and seen on tv. Finally got there. Need to go back, with with more bags and money!Some great specialty continental and British delicacies||May 26, 2013
DBM007_13||40||Just by London Bridge station, an enjoyable and interesting spot for a wonder, with loads of great eating options. Well worth a visit!||May 26, 2013
Maninasuitcase_10||50||Perhaps one of the best places to spend a morning (day) in London. It's rather hard to leave the place! The produce & the food is out of this world. Just make sure you take a lot of cash with you...it's not expesive but you end up buying a lot. A sunny day in London is not complete with out you visiting this lovely food market. ||May 25, 2013
easy1153||40||On our first trip to London, Borough Market was on our must do list....up there with the Tower and the Abbey.The planned visit took place yesterday, but the weather was foul even for London. Teeming rain, cold and sort of getting a bit lost leaving London Bridge Tube.Well worth it! The Market is wonderful for anyone that loves great varieties of food presented in a real market atmosphere. Great cheeses, meats, seafood, fruit & veg......everything!The stall owners are very welcoming and rightly proud of their produce. Lots of samples and prices are reasonable.Don't miss if you love great vibe matched with great food.||May 25, 2013
ljquarrell||40||On a recent trip to The Shard we arrived early , so after finding where we were going we popped back to Borough market. Never seen such a variety of bread,cheese,mushrooms,spices I could go on . lots of samples to be had , the smells were fantastic and FREE.||May 25, 2013
mike e||50||look man,this place is all the food vendors you dream about in one tightly woven area.The brownies are legendary and Pie Minister had the best pies in the joint.There are great macaroons at good prices and really anything you want.||May 23, 2013
steve_buck||50||Borough Market is a vibrant, buzzing place with a huge variety of stalls selling every variety of food. Make sure you check that the full market is open before visiting (normally Thursday, Friday and Saturday) otherwise there is only a much smaller selection of stalls open over the lunch period. The range of foods is amazing, from basic fruit and veg stalls to oyster bars. There are fabulous delicatessens and some fantastic places to grab delicious food. It can get very busy so be prepared to queue for the most popular hot food stalls at busy times - but it is worth it. I once waited about 20 minutes to pay £5 for a toasted cheese sandwich (from Kappacasein) but it was absolutely delicious. Well worth a visit.||May 23, 2013
thetaming||50||Unparalleled food. Outstanding vendors, excellent shopping for gift items and specialties like fudge or goat's milk ice cream. Outstanding chorizo sandwich (can't remember the name of the place), fun bars, and delicious food from Roast!||May 22, 2013
Jono_Melbourne||50||You will probably have to eat your lunch standing, and have to queue, but the food stalls are amazing. ||May 21, 2013
Cristina M||50||We sort of accidentally ended up there on Friday around 11h. Unfortunately too early for our stomachs. The cakes, breads of all sorts, and etc, etc, etc....We came back on Saturday and it was PACKED!!!But worth! We loved it!!!!||May 20, 2013
Max S||50||This was the #1 thing I was looking forward to in London, and it did not disappoint. It was recommended to me that I get there around 9am, which in hindsight might have been a good idea, as I arrived around 10:30am and it was already PACKED. When I say packed, I mean it is seriously packed, and quite claustrophobic. But if you can get past that aspect, the selection is unbelievable, all the vendors were very nice, and you can pretty much eat anything and everything. Plus, just about everyone will let you sample their stuff first. All the bakeries were incredible, European bread is so much better than even artisan Californian bread. Oysters were fun and not overly expensive. Pies were to-die-for. Shaved cured pig was mouth watering. And the cheese / pate selection was the largest I'd ever seen in one place. I didn't even eat dinner I was so full the entire day. Go with a huge appetite, bring cash, and prepare to spend a couple hours there wandering around. Also a great farmers market if you're cooking at home, some incredible mushrooms and vegetables and exotic meats as well. Kangaroo meat? Zebra?||May 19, 2013
basmaberti||50||Delicious international food to buy for the house as well as eat there for lunch. so much variety including oysters, cheeses, paella, pastries, coffee, bbq, sandwiches, fresh produce, breads, fresh fish and meat... and so much more. It is a must visit for foodies in London.||May 19, 2013
Susan_2804||40||London's Borough Market, is one of my favorite places as I'm a foodie at heart :)Borough Market is a gourmet food market that’s located in Southwark Street. This is where wholesalers of fresh produce, organic food and food stalls serving anything from good old British food to international flavours can be found.If you come between Thurs to Sats when the market is fully opened, it's perfect for brunch or lunch.Don't miss some of my favourite stalls- Monmouth cafe for their legendary coffee- Shell Seekers for their stir fry scallops- Kappacasein for their amazing cheese toasties!For more food recommendation, do check out my blog for pictures and review. http://ajugglingmom.com/londons-borough-market-in-pictures/||May 17, 2013
HeatherCS914||40||It's bigger than we expected, and was very very crowded, but we got a ton of free tasting samples, and even more free smelling samples. Everything looked and smelled fantastic! Pricier than your general street food, but when we finally settled on a Venison burger (cooked right in front of us) and a smoothie (mixed right in front of us) (we split it for a total of 8UKP or about 11-12 USD), we were happy with our choice. A MUST to try some good English street food!||May 16, 2013
--Regensburg--4||50||The market is next to the London Bridge and opens Thursday to Saturday. The food available there is fantastic, I had a hard time picking what to eat. Most vendors even let you try their food. I especially loved the organic cider, and the sweets. I had an amazing bread-and-butter-pudding. You should make sure to get there early because it got really busy when people from the surrounding offices came to get their lunch. Don't miss this, it is one of the nicest markets I have ever seen.||May 15, 2013
orchidlady218||40||Great place to visit even if you are not a dedicated foodie. Food and drink from around the world all under one roof. Free samples galore to taste before you buy. It can be a bit expensive but the quality is mostly very, very good. There are fish and fruit and veg you will have never seen before as well as amazing breads. It's not just for stuff to take home and cook, you can also have the most fantastic stand up lunch, many of the stalls sell both raw and cooked items if you can't wait until you get home and there are plenty of places for drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Nice part of London, you can see the Shard and the Golden Hind within a stone's throw. Highly recommended.||May 14, 2013
Annette D||50||Quite crowded place, amasing mix of scents, mouthwatering burgers by Mountain's Boston Sausage))) will definitely visit Borough marken when I'm next time in London||May 14, 2013
bcbsat||50||What a charming and exciting surprise. This venue was suggested by the owner of our hotel (Luna Simone) instead of some other markets we were considering. We were so glad we listened to him! Such a wonderful variety of foods, wines, crafts, more foods. Every vendor was nicer than the last, each one wanted you to try their specialty, and we could not have enjoyed ourselves more. Take your time and be prepared to wait in line occasionally, but it will be worth it. The restaurants looked inviting, but we just stayed with the market. Easy to access by the double decker sightseeing bus. The courtyard at the Southward cathedral next door is a lovely place to sit and enjoy some of your goodies, too.||May 13, 2013
SteveFLondon||40||As everyone says , this is a foodies paradise. Food from all over... The smells and the sights are amazing...Well worth a visit - only downside is that can get quite busy at times||May 13, 2013
yellowbear613||50||Very crowded farmers market but the grilled cheese sandwich stand is a must (and the raclette). Chorizo sandwich was really yummm too! Totally worth braving the crowds and the lines!||May 11, 2013
sandyB56||50||There are endless opportunities to indulge in international cuisine and local favorites.My senses were on overload as I entered. My nose tried to differentiate between odors that permeated the open market place. My eyes scanned the different kiosks. Colors and alluring signs pulled me from one stall to the next. In many spots, I was able to touch and taste samples while I listened to the everyday chatter of nearby people and the constant hum of traffic. So much was happening simultaneously. I felt swept up by the experience.The Borough Market is open Thursday and Friday afternoons and during the day on Saturday. It is located near the London Bridge tube stop. If you love food and are in London, it would be hard to pass up this experience.||May 11, 2013
sazoram||50||I am almost hesitant to write a review as I don't want to contribute to the Market becoming any more popular than it already is! Just about any type of food is available here: "exotic" meats such as zebra and ostrich burgers to vegetarian mushroom pate. Wheatgrass smoothies or Pimm's cups, pieminster pies and artisan chocolates--oh my! And samples, almost everyone will give you a sample. You could probably get full just from the samples. But I doubt you will come away without buying something. YUM!!!||May 11, 2013
kazzy006||40||We stumbled upon borough market, when we was waiting to go to the view at the shard (just round corner). So we only had a short walk around, but there was so much to see and buy, a foodie heaven! Bought some biscuits which were to die for (homemade). Will be going back to spend more time looking round, well worth a visit, and you can eat there in the many cafes, stalls.||May 10, 2013
wiskeyboo||50||One of my favourite places to visit. A step back in time to traditional London all relating to food and drink ...what more could you want! A great place to visit on a Saturday morning where you can buy fresh produce, reasonably priced and even try before you buy. A great place to buy fresh if your having a dinner party in the evening. Can't recommend highly enough!||May 10, 2013
Richard B||40||Spend a brief couple of hours here on my way through London. I reminded me of how a market should be - plenty of fresh food. There seems to be a focus on bakery items and sea food. I tasted some cheeses and chocolate. Worth a visit.||May 9, 2013
Iona-Luing||30||Ok, a Saturday lunch time is probably not the right time to go, but we left again quite quickly!It was far too busy and there was just no opportunity to look at anything. You did not move by choice, but were dragged along with the crowd! ||May 8, 2013
GinaTravels18||50||This place is amazing. Hungry girl's dream! You will want to have a little of everything, and would be willing to spend the money once you what is available but it is CROWDED! by prepared to push and to wait in line and another line and more lines. The payoff outweighs all this. Eat your face off and enjoy every minute!||May 8, 2013
Hoylel||50||I just love this place. Fab butchers (left hand side as you go past the French Stall - who sell some really good cheeses and foie gras mousse). Find the man who has the olive stall and stuffed peppers. Street food out the back. Foodies paradise (and vinopolis is just down the street). ||May 7, 2013
MissZ123||40||A lovely place to look around the only problem was I wanted to try every stall. Loved the atmosphere and the hustle and bustle of this market.||May 7, 2013
greenlover006||50||This is MY type of market. I love food & the quality of food at Borough is simply top notch. Prices are not cheap though, with a plate of paella costing £5.90.I loved the vibrancy of the place & warmth of the stall owners. Even though it was relatively crowded on a weekday noon, queues moved fast & there was no jostling or squeezing. The stall owners were incredibly generous eith their sample servings as well. It was a pity I cldn't lug back all the wonderful cheese, cakes etc. Definitely a market not to be missed for food lovers.||May 6, 2013
davelewis21031967||50||Travelling from Australia, family took my wife and I here....Absolutely fantastic...No crowds, plenty to sample and buy, easy to get to, to lines or queues..... London at its best!!!! Well done guys!!I so wish The Rocks markets in Sydney was as good!||May 6, 2013
lilac22||40||Stumbled on this market on a weekday so only part of it was open. What we did see was fantastic so will definitely visit again on another day when in London. So much food to try and the atmosphere was great. Well worth a visit. ||May 5, 2013
YvetteW_11||40||A must to visit. Busy, vibrant and friendly. Wide variety to food and drink to be had. Disappointed that a artist's work I was hoping to see was not there anymore. He'd been displaying his work for at least 2.5 years, only to be informed as he wasn't selling food his work didn't fit in!!! I took my complaint to the Borough Market office. My support for his work was based on the fact that he was local and depicted amongst his work local area paintings. This added a dimension to the market, whilst I do appreciate it is a food market there is always room for a little diversity that brings in extra business.||May 5, 2013
Azy03||50||Awesome place to stop and have a takeaway meal on a nice, sunny day. The market us situayed in a central lication and you can walk to attractions like St. Paul's Cathedral or along the Thames. There are also a few pubs in and around the market as well if you care to stop and have a drink. Highly recommended, especially if you're travelling to London during warmer seasons. Fair warning: it can get bery crowded. ||May 4, 2013
organiserguru||50||A trip to London wouldn't be the same without a visit to the Borough Markets. They are feast not only for the stomach but for the eyes, with a diverse array of food and drinks on display. Grab a prosecco and stroll around nibbling on tastes of jamon or cheese, olive oils, balsamic vinegar with bread. One of the reputed best coffee shops are found here, and then there is the chocolate. Keep walking the walking going after your visit though to burn off all those calories.||May 4, 2013
TZ862||40||Full of food you want to devour at every turn, the air itself smells delicious with the cooking and there's plenty around that's free to try if you're not sure what to get.||May 4, 2013
mattsal1234||50||I go here monthly. Yes it is expensive and you do need deep pockets. Walk round first try the freebies. Look out for neals dairy yard. Eat eat and eat some more. Best tip try a takeaway roast. Try the argetinian empinades. I cant get enough of this place. Go early or face the crowds. ||May 3, 2013
travelpips||30||If you feel hungry and you found yourself in the nearest take a look at this market.It will satisfy either you eyes and your stomach.||May 2, 2013
Anat G||50||All the rest has been said...On the last day of spring vacation, a day which was cold like hell, after trying to go into the British Museum's "Life and death Pompeii and Herculaneum" exhibition without much success (line for the bathroon - 1 hr...) we were comforted at this jewel!A must foor foodies.||May 2, 2013
TheKellysonTour||50||If you are a "foodie" then the Borough Market is for you. The sights, sounds, smells - all so wonderful. I was particularly in the love with all of the cheese and sausage/salami stalls, oh and don't let me forget the bread, oh the bread.This is a wonderful place to have a wander around, a must see. The zebra burgers had us intrigued for sure.||May 1, 2013
paleninteresting||50||Loved the atmosphere at Borough market. Spent a morning here looking at the different stalls on offer. Great to see so much Cumbrian produce on offer!! Get off the tube at London Bridge not Borough.||April 30, 2013
Charlotte B||50||To sum it up, I never wanted to leave. It was an incredible adventure full of delicious eats. There were SO many samples and every kind of food you can imagine. The raclette can not be missed!! I suggest starting with a class of prosecco or sangria and wandering around on your first lap before getting more serious about what to purchase on your second lap =) Great people watching too.||April 29, 2013
mx5fan||50||We have visited the market twice now and its just fantastic. So many stalls with food ranging from bread, cheese, to fish and game. Would love to live near by, just to be able to get fresh food and such a variety on a daily basis. This place has such a vibe. There are a wide range of restaurants surrounding the market, but some of the stalls serve fantastic food at a fraction of the price.||April 29, 2013
thejohnsys||50||If you're into your food you'll think you've died and gone to heaven when you walk into borough market. The sight, And smells of all the food on offer is unbelievable- pretty much any food you can think of cheeses, meats, fruit, vegetables everything of all types. Definite couple of places to recommend is the ginger pig which sells meat and meat products and I'm not sure the name of it but there is an exotic meat stall by one of the exits where we bought some delicious camel burgers on our last visit. There is also a fantastic cafe called Maria's which does an outstanding breakfast pretty much anything you can imagine. been there a couple of times and that's fantastic. Even if you're not going to buy, theres plenty of tasters to have and the whole thing is an experience even if you're not really into food. it is a definite recommended visit if you're in London and have a couple of hours to spare to do something different.||April 29, 2013
senorburrito||50||Our daughter, who's studying abroad in the Netherlands, took us here on a spring break vacation to the UK and Belgium. She insisted that it would be a good place to take our college aged son (translation: bit eater) before we headed to some sightseeing spots (Tower of London, Tate). She was right. Although we went on a Wednesday, which meant the full market was not open, the food stalls were up and running for lunch and we had a feast. A sandwich here, an empenada there, some coffee, some cheese, some pastries... Of course, there are open air markets in most major cities, but Borough Market has some really nice high end venues, and some tasty funky stalls. A great mix to browse, graze and eat, to my mind.||April 29, 2013
GlennRobinson||40||A previous reviewer mentioned how busy the market has become and he's right. I've been three times in the last 8 months on a Saturday and by 11am it's heaving.That said, the choice of food available to buy is fantastic and the quality of everything we've ever bought has been excellent. If you like your food you absolutely must go here.||April 27, 2013
Darren_h1974||40||Have been to borough market several times recently. It's a great place to visit at lunch and always got some amazing food stalls. We all have particular types if good we like, be prepared you will be jostled and have to queue for up to 30 mins for your food. Mostly it is worth it if a little overpriced. My tip would be to go later or earlier and avoid lunch. Also look closely at what is being cooked and how they are cooking. I was recently surprised at the method being used to cook something. Finally many of the food stalls operate online too. Might find prices are cheaper online. ||April 27, 2013
The_Epsys||50||If you have a saturday or sunday morning in London, you must go here. It has great food for everyone to try and to buy. It has exotic foods from all over the world, as well as very fresh local fare.And it was a great experience to walk around with a cup of coffee, buy whatever you want for breakfast and lunch, and still be within walking distance of London's greatest attractions.||April 27, 2013
pierrette||30||I've been going to Borough Market for years. Last September was my last. The crowds are crazy and the prices have just become ridiculous. It seems there is just no limit to what tourists will pay for the experience of standing in line to get a so so take out and then trying to find a place to eat it. The church yard next door is always packed and next to impossible to find a spot to squeeze onto the damp stone wall or concrete steps. I still think it's worth the experience once or twice but I'm done.||April 25, 2013
akmannes||50||We went on a Friday around lunch time. Very busy but fun. The toasted cheese sandwich is amazing. Go hungry. ||April 24, 2013
MeagIngalls||50||I had heard from many travelers just how great the Borough Market is, and they did not let me down. You can spend an entire day, maybe even two, just walking around and taking it all in. This is a food lover's paradise! My favorite shop was the chocolate emporium. Make time to visit the Borough Market when you are in London!||April 24, 2013
Jad A||50||I visited Borough market on a Friday morning and it wasn't too crowded. The market is well organised and clean. I was amazed by the diversity and the quality of the products that come from all over the world. You can find fruits, dairy, charcuterie, roasts, meats and seasonal british game, breads and pastries and sweets, spices and condiments, tea, drinks... The traders are friendly and invite you to taste their products. If it's lunch time and you can still eat, you can visit the lunch market where you can try cooked recipes from all around the world. And if you still have time I recommend to visit the Southwark Cathedral nearby.||April 24, 2013
American_in_l0nd0n||50||Mingle with London's local foodies as they stock up on overpriced (but unique, fresh, & delicious top quality) food. It is open Thurs-Saturday. Saturday is by far the busiest (not all the vendors are there Thurs/Fri), and by 10am it is quite crowded. On Thursday & Friday it is popular with locals & nearby workers grabbing lunch. You can buy all sorts of great meats, cheeses, and international delicacies. Many vendors also sell cooked, take-away food making it a great spot to stock up for a picnic or stop for a casual lunch. If you are looking for something beyond the "big tourist" spots and are into food this is a great addition to your itinerary. It is very close to the London Bridge underground & train station, but also easy to get to walking along the Southbank.||April 23, 2013
boonyuru||50||We went on a saturday morning so naturally it was crowded with visitors but that did not dampen our spirits! Thoroughly satisfied after bingeing on the food. One tip, share the food so that you can eat more! I started with the boston burger (5 pounds) which was delicious, followed by the cheese toast (my friend saw a long queue and decided to join in the fun). It was a little too cheesy for my liking. Then we went to monmouth and I had latte which was really fragrant! Recommended! Then we queued for scallops (5 pounds) with bacon bits and vegetables on the side which was really good! I also bought the blueberry cheesecake from one of the dessert stalls but only had it much later because any more food and I would be puking., The duck sandwich looked really popular too but didn't get to try it unfortunately!||April 22, 2013
GeraintLT||40||Visited Borough Market today for the first time in years. It was a sunny day, so it was great to see everyone in a good mood. There were a LOT of people in the food market, and a few random things going on (people including children creating an impressive human pyramid, etc). There's a church yard right next to the market, so the best idea is to pick up whatever you fancy to eat and take the 30 second stroll to the church yard to eat it - we had some British sausage baps and fresh iced (Earl Grey) tea with mint and lime - delicious. It's a great place for people watching and eating too much. Not ridiculously expensive either. I highly recommend it.||April 21, 2013
Ruth S||50||Get there early before it gets too busy to enjoy! It is the first time I have visited BM and it is full of amazing sights, smells and atmosphere! If you are a foodie then this place is a must to visit. The cheese stalls are amazing! I actually found some Finnish soft liquorice (been trying to source this for ages now!). I think I would travel to London just for this. Can't wait to return||April 21, 2013
arunilson008||50||We visited 3 markets during our trip and this was our pick as favourite! It mainly has food items only ranging from cooked food to fresh produce. The variety is amazing! We tried so hard to control ourselves. If were here with our parents or on a more expansive budget, we would have gone crazy!||April 21, 2013
Sharimck||50||Definitely worth putting on your list of things to do in London. Fun for the whole family! An easy 2 minute walk from the London Bridge tube station, this market is easily accessible and even has clean washrooms. So much fun to browse the food stalls, and all vendors will provide free samples with a smile, no obligation to buy, but you will be tempted. After snacking with the samples, make sure you eat at the raclette cheese place in the very back of the market (just ask someone, they will point you in the right direction). This is a really great way to talk to local vendors about their locally produced products and spend a couple hours enjoying the tastes of London. Don't miss the licorice stall!Arrive early in the morning to avoid the crowds (we got there at 930 on a Saturday and it was fine). Bring a camera, there are some beautiful food displays. Bring some hand sanitizer to wash after the tube station.||April 20, 2013
BBOSE||50||Been many times and the all new exstension makes it bigger and better. Top quality produce from the country's best suppliers but expect to pay top whack. Excellent market and a must see if visiting London :)||April 20, 2013
Natalie L||50||It's easy to spend a couple of hours walking around all the food stalls trying samples and taking in the variety of food and produce. If its breakfast time and you are feeling peckish check out Maria's cafe for a breakfast roll and mug of tea. Various fillings and hot drinks available - you can even have toast and marmalade if you want! Its reasonably priced and always busy!Or if it's later in the day why not treat yourself to a glass of prosecco as you are walking round?Borough Market is always buzzing but it can get a bit hectic around lunch time so expect lots of crowds if you are visiting around this time!||April 20, 2013
fruliv||50||A marked full of smells, tastes, looks. Food from Britain and France- high quality- beautyful presented. Sold by persons with knowledgde and service as high priority. Lots of places to eat and drink as well. A really good market- experince! ||April 19, 2013
buchabob||40||A fun way to taste a great variety food and drink in a festival setting. Conveniently located near a tube stop, there are dozens of food stalls with meat, cheese, fish, fruit, vegetables. Expect lots of people, both tourists and locals. Limited seating (except in sit down restaurants), so we sat in the church courtyard next door were many others were sitting and noshing. Plan a late breakfast or lunch around your visit, and then walk the neighborhood (Old Globe Theater is nearby).||April 18, 2013
DublinTraveler||20||I love everything to do with food, so a trip to London without visiting the borough market would be sacrilege.My two star review is only based on visiting at 2pm on a Saturday. It was a horrible experience. I could see lots of wonderful produce but could get no where near the stalls due to the crowds of people, we where just slowly pushed along narrow channels unable to freely look about. I just couldn't wait to leave, which for me to voluntarily leave a food market is unheard of.I'd love to return at a less busy time, but take my advice and avoid Saturday lunchtime!||April 16, 2013
Chichicastenango||40||A delicious lunch at a reasonable rate can be found at the Borough Market at the southern end of London Bridge in the south central section of London. A charming area along the Thames just next to the Southwark Cathedral offers an array of foods from England and beyond. Walking down the steps wafts of freshly cooked food drew us towards huge pans of paella and Catalan stew being prepared for the lunch crowd. Artisan breads & cheeses, raw Greek honey, fresh seafood, game, delicate slivers of ham from Parma. Fresh mushrooms and olives of every sort. Chocolates, cookies & brownies, eclairs and meringues....lovely! For lunch we went to the Kappacasein- the cheese man and ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and a small plate of boiled potatoes covered with creamy melted Raclette cheese accompanied by pickled onions and gherkins...THE BEST! We ate in the cathedral courtyard and then toured the church afterwards.||April 15, 2013
Iris v||50||Under the dark London Bridge there is a little alleyway leading down to the Borough Market.Once you see it, it feels like you discovered the new Diagon Alley (Harry Potter).It leads to a wonderful market full of fresh fish, bread, pies, meats, candy and lots more. The grungyness of the place makes it very photogenic. We loved The Globe, a pub that is tucked away in a corner of the market. The metro has been build against it and water is leaking from the facade but that gives it so much character.Wonderful experienceMarket is only open on Thursday, Friday (from 12:00 pm) and Saturday though||April 15, 2013
bobshifi||50||We found this place on the way to the shard. The smells are amazing. They have all kinds of food here. Cheese, breads, meats, truffle oil and chocolate, plus you can sample many of the items.||April 14, 2013
MartinL198||50||Had an hour looking around with friends prior to going up the shard for my wife's birthday. Absolutely fantastic and a must for any foodie loads of great stalls and opportunities to try produce from producers all over the country. The salt beef was the best i have ever had only bettered by the Prossecco bar!!||April 14, 2013
quinnsaz||50||Borough market is a great place to visit for Londoners and visitors alike.It is heaving at the weekends so it is not the place to go if you are on a tight time schedule and the more popular stalls always have queues.But if you are prepared to just go with the flow then it is well worth it.There is a wide range of produce on offer and it is all of the highest quality.Whether you fancy a rare breed burger,artisan breads or some fruit and veg there is plenty to choose from.Monmouth coffee is just next door providing some of Londons best coffee.||April 14, 2013
kitties63||50||The sights, the sounds, the smells. We trundled around the market on a busy Saturday morning. It was heaving. If you are like us and like watching cookery programmes and trying new thing to eat and cook you will love this market. There are lots of little free samples to try and if you are able to buy things to take home even better. We would love a market like this where we live some prices were cheaper than our local supermarket. Some unreal breads and cheeses yum!||April 14, 2013
reellady57||40||My daughter and I really enjoyed our visit to Borough Market during a recent trip to London. For the sake of proximity, we combined it with time at the Tate Modern (about 10 minutes walk), which worked very well. The market has an astounding variety of foods, both fresh and prepared, which reflect the cultural diversity of London and is a feast for the eye and palate. We went on a weekday and it was very crowded, so I imagine it could be crazy busy on a weekend. In the end I was so overwhelmed by the selection, that I had fish and chips for lunch (they were good but I wish I'd been more adventurous!) and my daughter enjoyed a delcious "shredded salt beef and pickle" sandwich. Afterwards, we treated ourselves to mouthwater raspberry and lavender goats milk ice-cream. Although there were lots of free samples to be had, they seemed to be mostly teeny tiny portions, so be prepared to buy something to eat. It's definitely worth a visit....||April 13, 2013
cjhall86||50||We loved wandering around Borough Market. Yes, there were hundreds (possibly a couple of thousand) people there at the same time, but that just added to the buzz. Cheese, bread, meats, fruit & veg, as well as many other products available from each of the independent stands and stalls. It's mainly covered by the roof, so an definite option even if the weather isn't great. Great smells and sounds giving a genuine taste of London life. Tip: hunt down the stall (near the entrance from the Vinopolis end) selling the duck sandwiches and mulled wine. Tip: bring cash. Not many stalls accept payments by card.||April 13, 2013
finnoir||50||Borough Market is such a happy place for foodies as there's just so many different flavours, smells and textures to tantalise and interest every palate!I was there on Thu, 11 April when the market is opened from 11am to 5pm and it was a great walkabout for lunch samplers as a group of us bought small portions of food to share a bite or two. We had freshly grilled scallops, on-the-spot shucked oysters, paella, organic vegetable soup, duck sandwich, roasted pork, Masala tea... I thoroughly enjoyed strolling around and exploring the delectable delights of this market.If you enter Borough Market from Three Crown Square, there's an information office where you can get a copy of the Borough Market map and list of stalls :)A very useful site is also the official Borough Market website with opening times, transport options, list of traders and so on.||April 13, 2013
Julie-anne A||40||The food at the market is really good and reasonably priced-my youngest son had a moo pie which he loved and the rest of us had a really good chorizo roll mmmmm! The negative was that we couldn't move for people and gave up very quickly1 ||April 12, 2013
RichiesWorld2012||50||The stalls and shops in this open air near London Bridge are phenomenal! A not to be missed spot for tourist and Londoners alike. Check out Neal's Yard for the best cheddar and the Ginger Pig for the best meat. Also, if you need whiskey or liquors don't forget the Whisky Exchange at Vinopolis.||April 11, 2013
Alison G||50||We found this by chance and were amazed. A brilliant selection of stalls with fresh, reasonably priced food, ranging from paella to cheese, lovely cakes, breads and fudge. Suitable for all tastes. Would really recommend it.||April 11, 2013
V4425HUannah||50||The Borough market offers a wide variety of foodstuffs on a weekly basis. There are many places to grab a quick bite to eat, as well as to stock your kitchen with fresh local produce, meat and cheese. The chocolate and gelato shops are very good. A foodie must -do.||April 10, 2013
neillyb57||50||Worth a visit as it is a real market and foodie heaven full of fantastic sights and smells. It is a typical traditional market with many foods and products.||April 10, 2013
cc2Wales||50||This is the second time my daughter and I have visited the Borough Market .Try and avoid bank holidays as we discovered this time (Easter) that it becomes very crowded indeed. It is a fascinating place with stalls ranging from artisan breads to hand dived scallops and from local farm produce to international specialities.The best thing about the market is the wonderful variety of ready to eat foods you can buy.Try the Vietnamese chicken curry, the freee-range chicken burgers or delicious cakes and wash it all down with a glass of Prosecco from the little wine bar in the corner. Don't bother booking a fancy restaurant for your lunch, just eat your way around the market..||April 9, 2013
StephenBarbia||50||Anyone with a love or passion for Food and Drink should visit the Borough Market in South East London. Just a minutes walk from London Bridge Station and 5 minutes from the Shard. However, Please note it is only properly open from Thursday through to Saturday. Saturday being the busiest day and the one that give the whole place its buzz. Delightful smells of food tantalise the nostrils and start working on your taste buds.||April 9, 2013
pbjap||40||You guest it, we our foodies and we loved the market. Plenty of samples on offer the first time we when drew us back again and we also brought our friends too. A super place to hang out for a few ours.||April 8, 2013
happygirl503972||50||This is a great market if you are foodie, be prepared to pay a little more, but you get what you pay for.Ideal for lunch too, the only problem is deciding what to have..||April 8, 2013
WarwickshireTopcat||50||Although I worked in London for 3 years I had never discovered this gem until my daughter nagged me to go. It really should be on every tourists list of places to visit. The variety of the stalls together with the quality of the many free samples made it an enjoyable time. I understna that it is used by contestants in Masterchef and it is easy to see why||April 8, 2013
SamSung2013||30||It was a nice place to check out. At first I thought this was a more local place but quickly found out that it's mostly full of tourists. It's like a farmer's market in London, so it was interesting. We walked around and got samples. I would definitely get the chorizo burger near the famous coffee shop (I forget the name). Would recommend a visit. ||April 8, 2013
rockfist||40||Great way to spend a Sunday morning! Go there, pick up some nice unusual food and enjoy! you might not even have to buy anything but just eat all the samples on offer!||April 8, 2013
John B||40||On Saturday (06-04-13), I was invited out to the London Bridge area for the afternoon, seeing as the sun was out for a change I grabbed at the chance. Taking the short walk from the Station, to Borough Market, I was greeted by music, large numbers of people and the smells of some fantastic street vendors cooking up a whole range of tasty treats.  The place was packed, and maybe the only real down side, as you have to fight your way in to get to the stalls a little bit, but the vibe was amazing. Head to the centre and you will find several vendors selling cheeses and chutneys, burgers, sausages and a whole host of other goodies. We went to a vendor just off the centre, and I was told by my friend the sweet chilli chicken wraps were divine.............. and you know what............. they were. Best chicken wrap I have honestly ever had. All though the market isnt massive, it is busy, and with various pubs and eateries all around it, with the sun out its a great place to be. After you have bought your goodies, had a nibble or two, head towards the Anchor and finish the jaunt with a pint over looking the Thames. Wonderful.||April 8, 2013
Rkwok68||50||On a recent visit to London, we stumbled across the Borough Market at lunch time. What a treat! We got to browse all the different types of food being offered by vendors. I ended up selecting a delicious Duck Confit sandwich for $5 pounds. My partner selected a Roast Hog sandwich with Apple Sauce. (but without the sauce) There was so much to choose; and it all smelled and looked delicious! It was very hard to decide. I would definitely recommend this as a legit UK dining experience for a low price.||April 7, 2013
stealingthunder||50||Newly revamped, with the arching Victorian roof restored, Borough Market is not just London's larder but one of the best food markets in the world. From Turkish, Greek and Italian olive oil to cheeses from Sussex, meat from organic English farms, freshly-shot venison, hand-dived scallops, rabbits in their fur, even a little shop in Stoney Street serving exclusively English wine, this has it all. Try to avoid Saturday when it is filled with tourists snapping photos like they've never seen food before.||April 7, 2013
DeeTilly||50||Great Everything you could imagine from artisan breads to chilli liquorice love it great for a hot steak brekkie bap cheeses galore fresh rabbits fruits and veg oysters juices wines and cidres ||April 7, 2013
Joysey||40||We visited on a bitterly cold Thursday afternoon. We loved it here - as did our 9 year old son. There is a lovely atmosphere, the stalls are wonderful and there are so many delicious things to buy and look at, you just don't know where to start. We enjoyed various wonderful cheeses, drank delicious and warming mulled wine and just wandered around, taking it all in. Next time, I would go at lunch time and eat there - you would be spoiled for choice.||April 6, 2013
mrtibs||50||A nice week-end tripto Borough Market, in Southwalk, get there early to beat the queues, hugh variety of high quality stalls selling artisan products, farmers market produce and scrummy PIES (probably not as good as those in Wigan!!). Whilst in the area look at Southwalk Catherdral and take a look upwards at the Shard!||April 6, 2013
Deedianne||40||They have an array of beautiful local foods but it is very overpriced. The Turkish stalls were my favorite but I didn't feel the value if the baklava and delights for the price they charged. There is a beautiful Japanese place towards the end.||April 5, 2013
travelbugdfw||50||We visited the Borough Market last May 2012 and plan on going again May 2013, specifically for the Kappacasein grilled cheese. My husband really liked it and since it was too much for me to eat he ate part of mine too. Yes it may be a little expensive but it was a worth it. He also enjoyed the real chocolate brownie he bought and the yummy Portuguese custard tarts- Pasteis de Nata (the best we had was in Lisbon of course). We may have to do some more taste testing with other foods, there was such of variety- I really liked all the bread available. Looking forward to our return trip.||April 5, 2013
Emma S||50||So you have to go in expecting to spend around £30/£40 at least. Plus get your speedy fingers at the ready. My sister refers to me as the "tasting ninja" as I am obsessed with trying everything on offer and will be in and out before anyone knows what happened :) I always make sure I go having had a good breakfast, as it is no fun being starving in a food market. Then I have time to make the rounds of the whole place before choosing what I want for lunch. Then there should always be time for pudding too. I try to go on a Saturday and then I will buy ingredients either for a great dinner, or Sunday lunch.It is probably more of an adult thing... But I always see teens and young kids there too who seem to enjoy it. But I don't think you can traipse around the whole place like I do in quite the same way with younger ones...I honestly think that it is pretty much impossible for anyone who likes food not to enjoy being there.||April 5, 2013
WJBDLB||50||It doesnt get any better than the Borough Market, especially if you are a foodie. Met the locals, ate everything from ice creme, to french yogert to paella and german sausage! Leave a lot of time--this place is huge and was expanding when we visited.We are returning to London this year and arranged accomodation nearby the Burough so we can spend more time there||April 2, 2013
Barrowontrenter||40||Combined a trip up the Shard and visit to Southark Cathederal with a visit to the market on Easter Saturday. Good experience but people can easily get carried away with the overpriced goods on offer. Probably the only bargain in town is the free samples, if you are cheeky enough to sample and walk.||April 1, 2013
Rupertpb||50||If you are a foodie...or even you just eat...you will love this market with its wide variety of gourmet foods, from sweets to vegetables to prepared foods...Come prepared to sample, buy, eat and enjoy. It is an outdoor market in very charming setting--a very tasty place to visit in the late morning. ||April 1, 2013
neal_jolly||50||Despite the cold and the biting wind Easter Saturday here was great. Wandering round the stalls, trying the tidbits offered. Truffle olive oil, pumpkin oil, different breads, cheeses.wow. Never seen so many varieties of mushroom in one place. Wish I lived closer and could go regularly. Ate the tastiest raclette melted on potatoes with pickles in the trad way. Mmmm. ||April 1, 2013
HilsANewcastle||50||Our first visit to Borough Road market was a great experience, although having to push your way through queues of people waiting to buy food & drinks at the stalls can be quite difficult at times. The stalls were a treasure trove for foodies and I found myself wishing I lived close enough to make this a regular outing. To be able to then walk along the Embankment, which is within easy walking distance, must make this an ideal weekend experience when the weather is warmer. ||April 1, 2013
AcropolisLover||50||Absolutely great market brimming with food of all sorts. Great breads and cakes, meats of every description... just bought shoulder of lamb for Easter dinner. Very busy, but it is a holiday weekend. Lots of places to eat and drink and good fresh veg and fruit in abundance. Spanish, Turkish, Greek, Scottish and even English foods represented here as well as lots of others. Not too pricey - excellent value with really friendly staff everywhere.All of this very near the river and in the shadow of the amazing Shard building.||March 30, 2013
Maturebutfunloving||50||If you enjoy food & markets this is the place to go - such a variety of stalls, both fixed inside and under umbrellas in the open.A thoroughly enjoyable stroll through food of all types, hot & cold, sweet & savoury, lots of samples! Traders are all small independent and very knowledgeable.A super atmosphere with The Globe Tavern right in the middle just right for a drink!||March 29, 2013
Animal12||40||Visited Borough Market on a cold snowy day in March. We arrived around lunch time and it was mega busy so decided to pop to local pub for a warm and drink. When we returned the market was less crowded so was easier to negotiate. A fantastic place to visit if you love food. Talk to the traders they are full of incredible information. Take advantage of the samples. We had a fabulous salt beef sandwich for lunch. Purchased some bread, cheese and pâté.Amazing displays of fish, fruit, vegetables and meat.Look out for the meringue display.Not a place to take a buggy.... Thoroughly enjoyed our visit but can't image what it would be like in the summer as it was so busy on a snowy day in March!||March 25, 2013
AntzEatz||50||Great food. Great nic knacks. Great atmosphere. Very authentic. Tons of variety. An awesome experience. Great value for food. Will repeat||March 25, 2013
lola584||50||There is an excellent array of stalls selling fresh produce such as fruit and veg, bakery, fish, meat or hot stalls with ready prepared take away food which smelt and tasted fantastic. There was a buzzing atmosphere with everyone very friendly and helpful. The selection of some of the cheeses especially the French stall were excellent. There are simply some things you can't buy easily anywhere else apart from Borough Market. On the other hand some things were definitely tourist prices.||March 24, 2013
Leopard_Lil||50||I stumbled upon this wonderful food market whilst walking to the Tate Modern from the Shard and was sorry that I didn't spend more time there. All sorts of wonderful fare was on offer from liquorice to Essex oysters. The German sausages on the barbecue smelled fantastic and the Italian cheeses were waving at me. However, I settled on some home-made fudge and vowed to come back when I have more time.Definitely my new favourite thing to do in London.||March 24, 2013
TelnChel||50||We visited Borough Market Thursday afternoon. All the food is outstanding. Unlike Camden Market which is mainly Asian and Caribbean, this is almost entirely all European. Cheeses, fruits, breads, oils, everything. The stallholders are keen that you try all sorts of freebies, and they are excited to tell you all about where it comes from or how it is made.The location is great - just over London Bridge, and there was time for a quick look around Southwark Cathedral, and the Golden Hinde.An excellent afternoon.||March 24, 2013
Leedsaway67||50||As a self confessed foodie & a lover of London, I can't believe I haven't been here before. Despite being a bitterly cold & snowy March day (yes March!!)' this was a great place to wander around.Superb food stalls with everything from charcuterie, bread, truffles, cheeses, fish etc, etc.The quality of produce is fantastic & lots of opportunity to have free tasting. Go hungry as their are some yummy food to buy. We shared a delicious Steak Pie, Vietnamese chicken curry, some freshly squeezed fruit juice & even some mulled wine (it was that cold).Close to the Tate Modern at London Bridge, this is well worth a detour for lunch.||March 23, 2013
tim_corke||50||Borough Market is the only way to do shopping in the capital and packed with interesting artisan stalls selling mushroom pate, boutique cheeses, jams and pickles and a whole range of other delicious treats. Be careful as you'll want to buy everything on sale so if you can, do!Top tip - don't go before lunch as there's plenty of yummy treats to taste.||March 23, 2013
luvroma2||50||Although the market is open other days of the week, the day with the most open stands is Saturday. We were there on a very rainy Saturday and, in spite of the weather, the market was mobbed with patrons.The array of food available for sale is endless. There is meat, fish, poultry, produce, spices, wine, baked goods as well as a wonderful assortment of prepared food. There are ethnic foods of all types - Mexican, Italian, South American, Greek, English and my favorite - the grilled cheese sandwich made from three different cheeses on Poilane French rustic bread.Many merchants offer samples of their items to entice you to buy. I wish this market were in my neighborhood!!||March 23, 2013
NB1957||50||Whenever I am in London and I have the chance to visit Borough Market I don't miss it and like another reviewer it is my favourite London attraction. When I am with my partner she is of exactly the same opinion, it is where she most wants to go in London. The variety, the quality and the presentation of food is wonderful. There is a great atmosphere with a mixture of delighted tourists and serious food buyers, I fall into both categories when I visit as I cannot resist buying something new and different but I can also walk around for ages just staring at what is available. In adjoining streets there is also a great variety of shops selling cheese, chocolate, English wine etc, which incidentally is of exceptional quality.||March 23, 2013
fetcham||50||OK, i'm not a tourist, but this is something we should support, so hopefully I can help make it a good experience.. You'll read many wonderful things about borough market here, so here are the practical bits! Best overland station is London Bridge - to get to the market you need to walk out by the Shard, then down the hill, keeping borough bar and all bar one on your left. When you get to the road, cross straight over at the lights and through the archway opposite, and that's the start of the market. If your coming by underground then head to Borough and you'll find it opposite you so. Best days to visit are thursday - saturday. I walk past them setting up at 08:30, and taking it down at 19:00, and they'll be open slightly later in the summer. It's best in dry weather but there are plenty of areas under cover just in case. If you go to http://www.boroughmarket.org.uk/ then you'll get the sales stuff but also useful things like a market map! From my perspective it's worth knowing they cater for all types, providing hot and cold food from paella through to legs of lamb and all the cheese varieties you can imagine and well worth nipping in for a browse. Best to take cash.. and lots of it if you're in a buying mood.||March 21, 2013
sambell79||50||This place is a paradise for real food lovers. Rarely markets in London offer such a big range of food with such a quality. There is ostrich meat steaks, farmer made French cheese and Spanish chorizo of a quality I have never seen in London. The atmosphere and the merchant are funny and they make the experience better.||March 20, 2013
hokuros||50||What a terrific outdoor market to browse and graze! A real delight, and the lovely and historic Southwark Cathedral is immediately adjacent, it's yard offering a good place to relax and eat what you've purchased--if you can find a seat! My favorite vendor was Pieminister, with a wonderful array of savory pies (I can particularly recommend the Kate and Sidney, aka steak & kidney). The market goes on and on, so wander fully before committing yourself! There are enormous pans of paella, fresh oysters and clams, raclette from Kappacasein, etc. etc. For those hunting English cheese, Neal's Yard is just outside the market across the street.||March 20, 2013
485MichelleH||50||Amazing place - every stall and item you could think of, the fish stall was incredible with huge fish arranged with squid/prawns peeking out - a photo opportunity if nothing else! The traders are really friendly and often let you try samples of the food - we had a forkful of the paella, and also some chorizo - yummy! Would love to have been able to shop for my dinner ingredients there, sadly was only a tourist, but will bear in mind for another time and come armed with a cool bag! Could easily spend an hour or two here, plenty of things to buy to eat and drink too - including a cheeky glass of prosecco!! very reasonable prices - have paid more at the Good Food Show. You must call in here on a Saturday (take tube to London Bridge and exit on the Borough High Street exit).||March 20, 2013
freutmich||50||I almost didn't go to Borough Market on my last Saturday in London, but at the last minute I changed my plans. Lucky me! I thought this place was incredible! The fresh produce and meats are beautiful. Sadly, as I was a tourist and not a local, I couldn't take advantage of those items. But there are plenty of vendors selling prepared foods. Some reviewers here are critical of the prices, and some things were a little outrageous. But look around and compare before you buy. I ate several wonderful things and spent no more than £5. Be patient, get the lay of the market before buying anything, and this can be a remarkable London experience.||March 17, 2013
Andrew S||50||This is a great place if you like markets - just wandering around and browsing. Something for everyone. You could spend hours here!||March 17, 2013
bigjohnn||50||Just exelent. We came here on saturday and had a crowded marked at our feed. Crowded with people and goods. To bad we are flying ryanair with just cabin luggage. Arrive early and live jusr after an early lunch!||March 17, 2013
colin p||50||This is a must for any foodie visiting London. If you are on a short break or just in London for the day it should be on your list of places to visit. It’s tucked away under the railway arches but well worth finding, it has all types of fast food, from salt beef sandwiches (my favourite) to Turkish delight. It’s great when you can talk to the stall holders about the products for sale and they are so enthusiastic about their wares. Always take a cool bag because you will not be able to resist.||March 17, 2013
avidtraveller57||50||This was recommended to us by a colleague. Family of three spent three hours wandering around the market. Amazing smells, fantastic food, a real energy to the place. Definitely recommend and will definitely be back!||March 17, 2013
framboise8||50||I spent 2 hours here my first day in London and would've been content staying around for longer if I didn't get so full. There was so much to eat! The duck confit sandwich from Le Marché du Quartier (£5) and a trio of grilled scallops over veggies and bacon from Shellseekers (£6) were two of my favorites. I got a plate of paella (£6) too, but I could barely finish it because I was so full already; it wasn't that great so I didn't feel bad tossing a half eaten plate. I expected the produce here to be really pricey and while a lot were, there were good deals to be found. I got 3 containers of raspberries (probably 20 ounces total) for just £1—an amazing steal! Definitely stop by if you're in London.FYI: Bring cash. There's a Barclays right before you get into the market but there was a 15-minute wait in line on the Saturday that I went.||March 16, 2013
CatK2000||50||Packed, vibrant, excellent on the hoof eating options! Do not miss the opportunity to visit this market. (Closed Sundays)||March 15, 2013
Brian P||40||It must be good, because I keep going back there - usually with out-of-town or foreign visitors. If you love good quality food in all it's varieties, do go to Borough Market, you will think that you've died and gone to heaven. It shows that not all that we eat in this country comes from some anonymous assembly line, pre-wrapped in plastic, and, whilst you may well come out poorer financially, you should feel richer gastronomically!||March 15, 2013
Juliepenne||50||Borough Market is my favourite place in London, its so atmospheric ! I love the fruit and veg stalls, the flowers, the meat, the diverse choice of everything you could possibly want to eat in one place. Go early as it gets very busy xxx||March 15, 2013
Annecyborn||50||Borough Market is a delightful place to spend a few hours. Even if you can buy most of the foods if you are staying in a hotel, there are samples galore, plus candy and pastrie that can be eaten anytime. The choices of cheese is remarkable. There are also lots of stands to buy prepared meals. Don't forget to stop by Southwark Cathedral which is just behind, treat your eyes and spirits.||March 14, 2013
Headless||50||Take a walk over the water to Borough Market and be suprised. While away an hour or two looking and tasting the delights of this hidden gem. You can't miss it just head for the shard. Barrowboy and banker is just around the corner for a good place to rest,eat and drink.||March 13, 2013
davsuze||40||We always have fun when we go to this marketplace. There are booths that sell all kinds of things but mostly food. We eat are way thru and take home things for later. Our favorites are the brownies, the grilled cheese sandwiches and the potatoes, cheese & pickles. A fun market experience. ||March 12, 2013
Mortelini||50||Spread out under old railway arches, Borough Market has an historical feel to it but also up to date. It is a bustling market, bohemian in nature with fine wines and cheeses competing with fresh wild game. It reminds me of London markets of yesteryear, such as East Lane or Petticoat Lane. Friday afternoon was thriving without being oppressive. Strange scents and sights are everywhere. Bring a camera! Wonderfully colourful!The only downside is for mums with buggies. Most of it is cobbled which caused a few problems for one mum I encountered.Free samples were there to be tasted, and very nice they were too. I had a wild boar baguette for £4. Pricey but nicey.||March 12, 2013
caribecove14||50||Great produce on offer from around our islands,and europe,but middle England has invaded this fabulous market,and made it almost impossibe to shop here comfortably.unfortunately it has become a victim of it's own success. Not sure what the answer is, but 90% of people that visited the market were here to grase on the tasters,and soak up the atmosphere.||March 10, 2013
Claretta_leek||50||Until you see it with your own eyes, a review will never prepare you for the wonders on display at this market. Forget a normal street market, this is the creme de la creme of markets and only sells the best. But it's not just the food, it's the atmosphere and the effort people have made to display their wares. I found a Prosciutto Crudo here for a very small village in the hills of Sardinia that i have not yet been able to find in Milan. Love it & cannot wait to go back.||March 10, 2013
Prep678||50||They have everything here. Cheese, homemade pickles & other jared goods, fresh hot food, freshly baked sweets, fishmongers, butchers, cured meats - you name it - they got it!If you love food you have to go. The vendors are friendly and encourage you to try their wares before you buy. They are - and deservidley so - proud of what they do. I went for inspiration for the street food scene and did not leave dissapointedGo!||March 9, 2013
Smigiggles||40||I have been to Borough Market several times over the years. It's a great place to find good food -- just don't look for a place to sit down! The food ranges from sausage on a bun, to unpasturized cheese, to baked goodies. There is no shortage of food for the earthy-types(though it certainly isn't a vegan's paradise). My one wish would be for a few more choices of veggie food. The Pie Minister's veggie pie was delicious!||March 8, 2013
MrsP-Somerset||50||First time to Borough market but it won't be the last, what a fantastic foodie heaven! We went on a Saturday but it was a very cold snowy weekend in January and so maybe less people braved the cold- it was bitter! - but we didn't experience hideous crowds.There is food to suit every taste, we found we were spoiled for choice and 8 of us managed to sample as many options for breakfast, would love to go back in the summer and enjoy sitting at one of the lovely outdoor cafes. highly recommend.||March 8, 2013
9badger||50||What a great place.We visited on a Sat and arrived about 8:30, quite busy but tolerable.The sights of the produce so skillfully laid out was fantastic. The oppurtunity to taste the food was limited but very interesting.I dare you not to buy something to put in your kitchen never to be tasted (my wife always does)Very busy later in the day great place to visit||March 7, 2013
effbee73||50||Been many times during the week but went on a saturday and wont do that again far too crazy busy. Great pork crackling rolls at roast which are worth the queue. Dont queue for monmouth coffee if busy as the italian ice cream place next door sells great coffee! Well worth a visit||March 7, 2013
theculinaryexplorer||50||Working round the corner from Borough Market, I have had the chance to sample a fair few of the stalls on offer.Thursdays and Fridays are truly a delight, full to the brim with a range of cheeses, meats, breads, sweets and lunchtime options to overwhelm the senses is the best possible way. Venture further to the opposite end of the market for spices, sauces, fish, and a range of edibles to take home and experiment with. Borough market is always busy but you never have to queue for long, and the people are always incredibly polite, happy to chat and get your order out how you like it.The gnocchi is scrummy. The vegan stall is definitely worth a try - very filling and delicious. The toulouse sausage hot dogs are a delight and the cheese & potatoes are the perfect pick-me-up on a cold or hungover day!Could not recommend more.||March 7, 2013
COSTGA||50||Great place to sample, and purchse, all sorts of food. 5 minute walk from London Bridge station. Mulled wine also on sale when we visited on Saturday, and we were pleased to see such a variety of stalls, better than a year ago.||March 6, 2013
andrew w||50||this is a great place to wjhile away a few hours with a close friend chatting and sampling and spending time together. but get there early and make the most of the fresh produce and the specilist services offered by the guys and girls on the stalls.cause when you are fighting with pram whielding mothers, backpack wearing tourists,lost children, pigieons, and every one else out to enjoy themselves who got up after a late night.your special time together will not be so special||March 5, 2013
Cheryl G||50||Food from everywhere, fresh from the market, available on Market Days (including Saturdays). The smell of the food stalls permeates and it wonderful. It is an exciting and buzzing place to visit for people who love to buy fresh produce from meat, salamis, cheeses, vegetables, wines .. I could go on. Set just along from London Bridge this busy market is a taste of London in the past. Wonderful.||March 4, 2013
DD15London||30||Went to Borough on Sat pm, it's always busy on Sat though. I live locally and in my opinion it is a big tourist attraction. This is why it's such a pricey market. If you have a special diet or like speciality food then this is the place for you. It's a proper foodie place for foodies. It's good if you just want to have a walk around like I did for 1-2 hrs. It's going through some renovations and is having a transformation and has lost it's old charm, hence becoming gentrified. I would recommend having a chorizo burger, very yummy. I also like buying organic bacon and sausages for Sunday breakie. Borough is a must for tourists but I prefer Spitalfields and Dalston market as the atmosphere is more eclectic.||March 3, 2013
FredrikJ550||40||A place to recommend for those that want to try home made and local delicacies. The place is is not enormous but of good size, enough for you to spend a couple of hours walking around and taste whatever can be tasted.Keep in mind - in some areas it's quite crowded. Also, it might not be the optimal place for kids since its food/drinks-only in 90% of the stands.Genuine and cozy!||March 2, 2013
Cathy E||40||I came away with some delicious produce (rye bread, hummus and blueberry jam) from this never disappointing market but the crowds almost defeated me on this occasion. If you can visit during the week would advise going then. Saturday late morning and you really can't appreciate the full variety of the place because of the crowds.||March 2, 2013
Surabhi_Shori||50||If you are near London Bridge or St. Paul's Cathedral in London do make it a point to visit the Borough Market. The market is located south of Thames just off London Bridge on its south side. The place is open from Monday to Saturday and is a foodies paradise. You can smell the market at least 5 mins before you see it. It has everything from fresh fruits and vegetables to meats of all kinds (raw or cooked including game and exotic meats like Ostrich and Zebra), flavourful cheeses, wine and sumptuous deserts. You will find the place crowded with both Londoners and tourists around lunchtime. Kapacasein has probably the best cheese toastie i have ever had which they make with leeks and onions and pieminister a wide range of delectable pies which you could enjoy with mash and gravy. You will find stalls selling Lebanese, Turkish, French, Indian and Spanish cuisine in addition to English, Scottish and Irish. All in all a must visit.||March 1, 2013
Agachi_11||50||Borough Market is a wholesale and retail food market in Southwark, Central London, England. It is one of the largest and oldest food markets in London, and sells a large variety of foods from all over the world.The market, which has focused historically on fruits and vegetables, has in recent years added stalls dealing with the fine food retail market, including some of the market's most famous traders Artisan Bakers DeGustibus, Furness Fish & Game Supplies, Peter Gott and Sillfield Farm, and the Spanish company Brindisa.Well worth a visit.||February 27, 2013
AdamH863||50||Great place to wander around and to try all the different foods, YUM. I would suggest getting there early and if you want to try something or have lunch don’t leave it too late as places sell out of things quickly.||February 27, 2013
sbspeedo1||50||The food here is sensational! This is a must visit market in London. If you're in the tower of london, london bridge area, get down here. The food stalls for lunch are sensational and the range of produce for sale is also exceptional. One of my favourite london markets!||February 25, 2013
RuthieCheshire_U_K||40||Great experience, lots of food to sample. Some hot food available for lunch on the move. Everything and more that you could need.||February 25, 2013

Queues were long for the food stalls but well worth the wait. You can take your food and sit in the cathedral grounds to eat it, or eat on the go but too many other temptations ther! Had a glass of Cornish Sauvignon Blanc at the English wines stall in the street, was as good as any New Zealand Sav Blanc.Great atmosphere and very close to The Shard and the Golden Hind ship.||February 25, 2013
Peter S||50||Friendly traders and excellent selections of food especially breads, cakes, cheeses, meats, fish, street food and drink but lots more besides. Also some good eateries nearby including Roast and Black and Blue for steaks. Victorian arcade and mostly undercover-get the tube to London Bridge then easy walk.||February 25, 2013
Landysan||50||I can't rave enough about this place. If you can afford to taste everything, do it. What food i did buy was incredible. The market is HUGE. I only spent a short afternoon here but made it a goal to come back everyday to try something else new. The pies, ohhh the pies...my favorites was from The Pieminsters. Just try everything, you can't go wrong. I wish I could live in the market. Check out market photos from my visit here: http://sandytlam.com/food/borough-market/||February 25, 2013
shanna_travel||50||This placebos amazing if you are interested in good food! Lots of stalls where you are able to try the product first! The mushroom pate is outstanding! In had a kangaroo burger for lunch, delicious and good value too! We must have spent about 2 hours here exploring the different stalls and what they had to offer! I wish it was closer to home!! ||February 24, 2013
Suzxq||50||The market place can get very busy, particularly on a Saturday, but well worth the squeeze. So much gorgeous food to sample and purchase! Yum yum!||February 22, 2013
TommyDLB||50||Borough market never fails to impress with every possible type of food. If you are a foody the you have to visit here!!!||February 21, 2013
Waysabout||40||It was via the Trip Adviser London city guide that I found this treasure trove of food, people and atmosphere. Briliant and vibrant with food for all tastes. Keep an ear out for the trains rattling overhead and an eye out for the historical sellers stall price guide.Loved it||February 19, 2013
Julie C||50||Who would have thought a wholesale and retail food market would be this much fun? I was astounded. So much food to try or take home to cook. Fish and meat and cheese and fruit and veg. Not to be missed.||February 19, 2013
Sanya Z||40||Sensory overload is probably the best way that I could describe Borough Market. So many different sights, smells and tastes to experience, it's almost overwhelming.My favourite area was the one dedicated to all different types of cheese. With free samples of Vintage Comte being offered for our tasting pleasure. There was also an area dedicated to fresh produce where you can buy organic fruits and vegetables - including the biggest and most beautiful globe artichokes I have ever seen (and they are nearly impossible to find in UK supermarkets), an area for cured meats like salami and parma ham, an area full of tasty bread and cakes and enough international hot food to keep you full for a week.I myself was extremely happy to find a stall run by "The Free From Bakehouse", which sold a plethora of delightful gluten-free goodies. The Red Velvet cupcakes are exquisite, with icing that tastes of a delicious cheesecake. And the salted caramel bites were equally amazing. It was the best gluten-free pastry that I have ever tasted. I wish I could have them all the time!Lunch choices were abundant, whether you are happy to settle for a sandwich, want a freshly barbecued bratwurst, or fancy something more exotic like a kangaroo burger. And there were plenty of drinks to choose from too. We casually supped on a cup of hot freshly-pressed apple juice from Chegworth Valley farm, but if we'd wanted to, we could have also had some warm mulled cider or a freshly squeezed vegetable juice accompanied by a wheatgrass shot.If none of these choices appeal to you, there are also plenty of sit-down restaurants in the surrounding area. Including one which specialises in serving fresh oysters - ooh la la.My only tip would be to visit the market either early on a Saturday morning or during the week, because by the time we got there this Saturday lunchtime, it was absolutely heaving, and unless you are willing to wait a ten minutes or so, or push your way to the front (which I'm sure nobody reading Trip Advisor would ever do), you are not going to get a proper view of many of the stalls.Aside from that though, this is definitely a place that I would love to visit again. Next time at a better time of day though.||February 19, 2013
M0n0r||40||I loved this market with its mix of fantastic stalls. The best one for me was the stall that sold beer and wine. The staff were very knowledgeable. There was also a lovely fresh pasta stall. It is also right beside The Shard although I did not go up!||February 18, 2013
European_traveller84||50||The recent refurbishment of the market area has made this feel like a new market. The themed stalls in the main area are great and you can instantly visualise what the stalls have on offer.Take a tasting tour of the market and sample before you buy, whether its some meats or cheese or a hot sandwish there is something for everyone.Before you start your culinary tour stop off at Monmouth Coffee to help warm you up and then take a strol around the stalls.The earlier you get here the better as its less crowded and generally full of locals picking up thier weekend treats, although the new layout means there is more room and so its less crowded.||February 18, 2013
Carley S||40||We visited on a Saturday to have a look around and it was hectic as anything- but it added to the experiance, there was lots of cheeses and bakery items to smell and some stalls offer tastings. There are a lot of fresh food stalls which are great, if you live nearby. We brought bread and cheese for our lunch and sat by the river to enjoy.||February 18, 2013
Tets-Kim||50||was told about this place for somewhere different to eat. well its a diamond of a place for food. so much choice from around the world and the smell of different foods cooking makes your mouth water||February 18, 2013
MariaM933||50||My favourite market in London! Anything you wanna eat or drink,u can find it here! Everytime im in London I have to come here to feel complete! A very nice place to spend lunch time/afternoon, wandering around the stools, trying a little bit of this, a little bit of that, food from around the world, just feels like heaven!||February 17, 2013
wilma d||50||We went on a Thursday and bought fresh fruits and nice pastries and all kind of nibbles for lunch. We loved the vibe and the great variety!||February 17, 2013
Yummyfoodrater||50||I absolutely love all the different products for offer in the market. It has a great bustling atmosphere and is crammed with hundreds of different stall selling good quality food, however some of the prices tend to be quite expensive, there is also little seating in the market, otherwise a great place to experience the different sounds and smells it has to offer.||February 17, 2013
MissMaggie48||50||What a fabulous market! My suggestion is to graze your way round trying the delicious samples that are offered by stall holders, take photos of the stands you want to return to and then, when you've seen the whole place, go back for your purchases. Take a big bag with you!It's a brilliant spot for photos.||February 17, 2013
Adyfield||50||Today was our first visit to Borough Market. The experience left me green with envy that we don't have anything like this near the Southampton / Portsmouth area. Everything sold was beautifully presented in the peak of condition. This place brings excitement, enjoyment & pleasure to food shopping. Whatever you want - herbs, spices, meats, world cheeses, artisan breads, chutneys, vast range of mushrooms,fruits, veg, exotic ingredients and the hard to find - its all here and of the highest quality. The stall holders are knowledgable & enthusiastic about their produce and more than happy to let you have a taste. The venue has recently reopened after refurbishment and is spilling over with atmosphere but very busy on the Saturday we visited. Even if you're not shopping, it's an interesting place to wander round. There are cooked food stalls to suit all tastes and budgets. For me it was a better experience than the BBC Good Food show. We can't wait to return - next time well bring a cool box to take produce home.||February 16, 2013
Nick-n-Heth||40||Hidden under the rail bridge there are lots of goodies to eat at this market. Right next to the Shard. If you plan to combine the two make sure you book Shard tickets well in advance. They cost £25 each in advance or £100 if you turn up. Burn the waiting time at the market and take a bag that seals air tight- the excellent cheeses for sale can be a bit smelly.||February 16, 2013
EdanB||40||Interesting food market, especially from countryside producers. Good meat to buy home or to eat on spot. Many people, very lively though quite crowded. Wonderful place for lunch on Saturdays.||February 14, 2013
welshblonde||40||We visited the market on a Saturday lunchtime, so as expected, it was extremely busy. There are 100s of food stalls and plenty of eating opportunities. It's a beautiful old building with real character. The area around the market is also very nice.Next time we will get there much earlier!||February 14, 2013
Owenthomas||50||We go to this market every time we come to London. It is very busy on Friday and Saturdays, with a wide range of food sellers. Very large variety of cheese and very informed sellers. The Kappacasein Cheese sandwiches is worth the visit by itself. Lots of places to eat both inside the market and in the streets around it.||February 13, 2013
wanderingalex||50||Went here for the first time on Saturday with a food blogger friend. My husband was instantly bowled over by the food stalls and tried salt-beef for the first time -he is now a convert. I was more interested in the produce and vegetable stalls. My favorite was the mushroom stall (amazing). This place definitely merits a few visits because you'll come across new things each time. My friend was trying to find the goats-milk ice cream stand but in the end we had to abort the mission because my husband had located the beer stand who gave him info on where to get our favorite Austrian Pilsner on tap in London (we have searched worldwide and only come across it in Chicago). Everyone here is an enthusiastic foodie (and not the annoying kind) so there is a good spirit in the air. Take some cash, take a holiday from the scales and enjoy!||February 11, 2013
Catherine E||40||Busy on a saturday afternoon, my daughter recommends visiting earlier in the day. Enjoyed the free samples and atmosphere of the market. Top tip - the fresh vegetable soup is delicious - make sure you taste test before buying, I was all set for tomato until I tried the thai red curry!||February 11, 2013
Knobby1977||50||We went to Borough Market after a recommendation from a friend. Its mainly under the railway lines so a great place to browse round when the weather isn't great. Lots of stalls with all sorts of foods. Huge stacks of cakes which were to die for, cheeses, breads, chutneys, chocolate, pates, beers, wines, fish, tapas goodies and meats like parma ham, sausage and burgers made from zebra, antelope, python....) If you can eat it then its probably there to buy. The Piemaster and The Sausage stall (by the steps near the Cathedral) were where we ate lunch. Very busy at lunchtime, but service is still quick, so arrive earlier for a more relaxed walk round.The Rake pub on Winchester Walk is a good stop for those who like real ale. Featured in the Good Pub guide with heated outdoor patio.||February 11, 2013
mentaltraveller||10||Not a real food lovers market, more like a tourist trap and sham, or front/movie set. Too crowded to be fun. I mean really tightly horribly I can't move forward back or sideways crowded. People mainly taking pictures, and standing in long queues for fast food. I stood in two of those queues, with great expectations: but the salt beef was dry and tasteless; the Cafe Brood fare was disgusting even though the people throwing it at us were hard working and eager. Then I tried to shop for cheese: the parmesan was like dust and had no flavour, a huge disappointment; the Comte was bland. This was probably once a proud market hundred years ago, it is just a nasty joke now.||February 11, 2013
sacredtrails||40||We passed by the market and were overwhelmed with the variety of foodstuff we saw and tasted. Chocolates different kinds came in big blocks. Cheese of so many different varieties, dips and sauces beyond what I could imagine, sausages and coldcuts that can drive any carnivore crazy, and interesting vegetarian choices. .. Prices are very reasonable.||February 9, 2013
RiojaRoger||40||Interesting sights and sounds taking the visitor back to the 1900's. Plenty of choice for food and drink. ||February 9, 2013
JoSmall||40||It's taken years for me to get to Borough Market, and having been this Saturday I wish I'd made it before. You can spend hours walking round and tasting all the scrummy things on offer - and maybe buying some too.It would be easy to spend a fortune as there's something for every taste, but it's also an interesting way to spend time just wandering and taking in the sights and smells.Saturday is very busy and there are still new stalls being prepared for opening after the long closure of part of the market.||February 9, 2013
Taxidevil||50||You can try a lot of the food before you buy but that's only because the food is so good that you will definitely want to buy something. There are bargains to be had - mis-shaped chocolates for only £2.50 a bag( yummy). Lots of choice for lunch on the go - we had a lovely sausage on bread ( they made one for us to share between two so saved money).Bought some tasty quiche to eat back at our hotel - the pastry was flaky and absolutely delicious.The "Olive Oil Co" also has some amazing balsamic vinegar with different flavours.( I bought balsamic glaze with truffle).However even if you don't buy anything it is worth a visit.||February 4, 2013
SpudExeter||50||Myself and my girlfriend visited on a busy Saturday in February, the whole place was buzzing. This market is like a theme park for foodies. Having checked out the informative website as soon as we entered the market I recognised traders names and establishments, we quickly made our way to an outlet specialising in English wine. The girl who served us was very informative but very unpretentious. we then made our way through the market it was really bustling and really atmospheric. Most of the stalls provide tasters of their produce, whether that is cheese , oils, paella or caribean cooking which gave it a food festival feel.The traders displays were stunning particuarly the fishmongers and the butchers. Dont go if you are squeamish or offended by dead animals as there are Deer, Partridges, Pheasants and rabbits hanging on full display.we went into one of the onsite pubs, and it was rammed being a saturday lunchtime. For foreign visitors seeking a typical english pub atmosphere then this would be the place to sample it. I believe there are 23 outlets ( Restaurants, cafes and pubs) serving food and drink at the market so please plan in a lunch stop during your visit.We are already planning another visit next time we are in the capital.||February 4, 2013
Gill M||50||This market for foodies has been going for a very long time and is in the shadow of Southwark Cathedral, two minutes walk from London Bridge station. No matter what time of year you go, it will be packed (only open Thursdays through Saturdays) and expect to pay top dollar for everything. This is not a cheap place to pay produce! Rather, it is a compact area in which to find the most amazing and unusual fresh food - everything from 20 varieties of funghi to aromatic Darjeeling tea leaves to superb cheese from Britain, France and Germany. It is a genuine melting-pot of ethnic specialities, including cakes, bread and middle eastern dips, not to mention gorgeous olives, organic fruit and a real chocolate brownie mountain! Spend the morning savouring the testers and then have a superb coffee at the Monmouth Coffee House or, better still, spanish tapas at Brindisi - the best, and most affordable, spanish tapas bar in London.||February 4, 2013
MAJ_Massachusetts||50||We only heard of this place from a local and loved it! The grilled cheese and raclette were perfect on a cool day. It's near London Bridge tube stop (don't go to Borough stop). Lots of little booths plus a few sit down spots with drinks too. We were moving fast through London and didn't want to take the time for a pub lunch. It was easy to walk through and then walk over London Bridge and on to Tower of London.||February 3, 2013
lingsue123||40||We loved it the moment we stepped in.. Mulled wine, mulled cider, fresh juices, excellent paellas, chorizo stew, bratwurst, raclette made from yummy cheese, cakes, chocolates, assorted cheese, coffee... I just didn't have enough stomach space to store all these delightfully looking food! The raclette was amazing and so was the paella and chorizo stew served with mulled wine from the first shop off the London Bridge! It was definitely an experience not to be missed while in London!||February 3, 2013
CharlotteBlake||40||Make sure you bring cash, the stalls cant take cards.Bring lots of cash. . .you'll need it. There are treats here for everyone!Try everything, even things you 'think' you won't like. Its how I found 'gaz' -on a Turkish delight stall, a Persian sweet, like marshmallow or nougat mixed with pistachios. But better. Much better. But very expensive. . . And worth it. I'll definitely be back.||February 2, 2013
Eventhzevoice||40||Great thai chicken curry, you can taste different dishes before you actually chose one. Good to get your strength back from Tate Modern/Shakespeare´s Globe Theatre.||February 2, 2013
Vikkie C||50||Borough Market can be found just outside London Bridge tube station and is an absolute must for any foodie or lover of quality. The market itself is divided into three sections - Green Market - which is partially covered, full of individual stalls and located behind The Globe pubJubilee Market - which is uncovered, full of individual stalls and located at the back of the market, andMiddle Market - which is covered, has permanent retail stands and located in the main building.You will find a plethora of fresh, quality ingredients including fresh fish, meat (cooked and raw), game, fruit and vegetables, cheeses, breads, pastas and herbs and spices as well as quality products such as jams and jellies, marinades, cereals, cakes and pies and a few eateries including a fish restaurant, hot roasted meat sandwiches, mezze selection, paella, curries and soups. ||February 2, 2013
Ali W||50||This is an absolutely must see in London. This market containing 3 different areas of stalls is the coolest foodie experience in London. I recommend the duck confit sandwich or one of the pie minster pies. Lots of free samples and other food things to enjoy looking at (kangaroo and zebra burgers anyone??).||January 31, 2013
travelpassion||50||We loved Borough Market; we visited during a recent weekend trip to London, as recommended by friends and work colleagues. We loved the hustle & bustle, the variety and quality of the foods both cooked and raw, the friendliness of the stall holders and the general atmosphere. This is a great place to come mid-morning, having skipped breakfast, so that you can try some of the fantastic foods on offer. The fact they have onsite public toilets and are located next London Bridge Rail Station, The Shard and Southwark Cathedral is a bonus.||January 31, 2013
Barton-bonviveur||50||The last, really comprehensive and quite excellent, food market I had been to was Barcelona's La Boqueria. And so, it was high time to give London's Borough Market a whirl. This I did last Saturday (26/01 ... Australia Day ... 225 yrs. and still going strong). First, I paid homage to my 'homeland's shore' by heading for Gamston Wood Farm's 'Ostrich & Exotic Meats' stall: I was keen to check out their Kangaroo Burger. It comes with mustard, mayo., cranberry sauce, caramelized onions & leaf salad for a very reasonable £4.50. What ... no Vegemite?! They also do Kanga. sausages, Kanga. meatballs and Kanga burger meat to take home to cook on your Outback barbeque. And whilst you're at it, you could always stop-by one of the fresh fish & seafood stalls to get some Tiger Prawns to throw on it as well.On the one hand - and in it - you could get yourself a Duck Sandwich. On the other - and in it too - from Roast Hobbs, "Pulled Pork" with BBQ sauce and coleslaw. £4.00, in a bap. How's that?! The portion sizes of virtually all of this 'street food' were handsome: good on the vendors. I witnessed a long, long, line of people snaking around a block on the market's fringe. I wondered if a box office must have been at the top end of the line, selling tickets for that night's performance of Cirque du Soleil. But no, they wanted a coffee from Monmouth. So what do you have to say about that, Starbucks? Hare and whole roe deer were on offer, that wonderful Nunez De Prado olive oil, vegetables galore, spices from exotic climes, artisan breads of many shapes & sizes, cheeses and cured meats from all over the place ... even lavender from Provence.We bought some ramekins featuring shellfish from original watercolours by Richard Bramble ...100 g. of finely hand carved Pata Negra from Brindisa ... and absolutely superb, fresh, Spinach Ricotta Tortelloni from La Tua Pasta. And had have we been going straight home, which we weren't, we would have stocked-up on a great deal more. As the morning progressed, the market got busier and busier. Lots of foreign tourists too. Doubtless why the market is being expanded. Made mental note: " Get there earlier next time and leave when the amblers become a never ending train of humanoids". So check-out the market's website: www.boroughmarket.org.uk/ and be sure to get your days & times right.||January 30, 2013
Sassie114||50||A great hidden treat - walking distance from London Bridge Station. Quirky, friendly and buzzing with atmosphere. Open Thursdays through to Sundays. Choose from a huge array of cuisine from all over the world and have lunch 'on the go'.Luckily for us we live not too far away as I have to regularly stock up on our preserves and cheeses! My husband's absolute favourite is the 'Chilli Chutney'. Superb.||January 29, 2013
Trience4178||50||Wow! Now this is what you call a food market! It is, without doubt, the best I've visited. Unfortunately we had a busy day of sightseeing the day that we visited so we couldn't spend as long there as we wanted. We enjoyed every second of the time we spent there though. The sights, smell and people all left a lasting impression. We visited Harrods later that day and the pastries and vegetables there were much more expensive but didn't generally look a patch on what we had seen on some of the stalls / in some of the shops. Whilst the market is within spitting distance from London Bridge underground we walked there from St Paul's Cathedral by crossing over the Millennium Bridge and taking in sights such as the Globe Theatre and the Golden Hinde. It's a 15-20 minute walk so I'd only recommend it if you are fit and able to do so. We will definitely visit when we next visit London. Next time though we will be sure to spend longer there and do it on the day we are traveling home so that we can take all the delicious fresh produce home with us!||January 28, 2013
Apark155||40||then you should definitely visit here. A great food market selling a variety of breads, meats (including some pretty unusual ones), fruit & veg, fish, spices, chesses, cakes etc etc. The most difficult choice was deciding where to eat as there's so much choice - we opted for the Brindisa Chorizo Grill which sells only 1 thing - a chorizo sandwich, which is fantastic!If you are a bit sensitive about where your meat comes from (i.e. animals) then you may want to avoid the butchery area due to the animals hanging but either way, well worth a visit.||January 28, 2013
jikoku||50||What a fantastic Aladinns cave of food this place is. If you have never been then you have missed a cornucopia of sights and smells. Every type of food is sold here, fresh fruit and veg stacked in multicoloured pictures. Fresh cooked meat and soups, sandwiches which will keep you filled for the rest of the day. Preserved meats from all over the UK and the continent.For the photographers out there this is heaven on earth, with so much to record. A London sight (and site) not to be missed.||January 26, 2013
Woodychester1||50||Stunning market with great food outlets. Fabulous quality meats, cheese and veg. All with the ability to try artisan street food, a must for foodies visiting London.||January 23, 2013
loulou71||30||Been to borough market plenty of times , but on my last visit it was dreadful. Far too many people in one area and the stall do seem to be too close together, you can't get to the stalls for people just standing there watch what's going off . The food which is sold though is extremely good .||January 23, 2013
worldranger_uk||50||Go there, and find the Duck Confit Sandwich. Its amazing. Yes theres legions of other food stalls of various descriptions proffering their produce and other tasty dishes. But the Duck Confit is king and always will be. ||January 23, 2013
Layla047||50||Had a fantastic Saturday afternoon here, mooching around the stalls, chatting to the wonderfully knowledgeable and enthusiastic stall holders, soaking in the sights and smells, buying some fantastic food to take home. Makes me wish I lived in London! ||January 23, 2013
britishgirl82||50||This London market was an amazing stop for our family whose members all have different food taste. A foodie's dream, this market has food, and produce, local restaurant sampling. Roast has a booth where you can order yummy concoctions with out having to visit the formal restaurant. We tried a variety of selections and couldn't decide which one was best. Some of the best food in London! A must see!||January 21, 2013
Johnbooth4||50||Food only market that is a delight to wander from stall to stall being tempted by the offerings of each stall holder. Cheeses around the world, vast selection of olives, breads, hams to hot dishes ranging from Vietnamese curry, croque monsieur the Pork belly with crackling sandwich. A beautiful way to spend an afternoon then to try some wines nearby.||January 21, 2013
liezel l||40||Spoilt for choice! You are met with lovely aromas from all the food stalls as you enter, we visited over lunch time with the locals from the surrounding business' in their suits and business attire....after much deliberation and confusion....decided on kebabs. Great choice!! trated ourselves to sorbet and freshly squeezed orange juice. Will defs go back if ever we get the opportunity to visit London again.||January 20, 2013
grahamb690||50||I really don't want to tell you about Borough Market but it is too late and the secret has been out for a couple of years now.This is the place for foodies and a great place to grab lunch for local workers. On Thursday and Friday at the end of the working day witness the phenomenon of pubs so full of city and local workers that they spill onto the street blocking the market street as they celebrate the end of the day and the end of the week with a pint. A great atmosphere.Don't be late when visiting as it is a working market and the stalls will close mid afternoon once the market gets quieter or they have sold all their produce. The market is not fully open on Monday and this is such a disappointment for me as when I am working in the area I always go to Brindisa for a Chorizo and red pepper sandwich. Mind you, sometimes it is a confit du canard sandwich at the French deli , or sometimes the roast pork sandwich at the Hog roast. The fruit juices and cider at the other stalls are worth buying to wash down your lunch. For dessert you need to wander over to the German stall for a nice big dessert and then off to another stall for your coffee. that is the thing about Borough Market - the way to enjoy it is to move from stall to stall choosing and eating your lunch as you go. A bit of this from here and a bit of that from there. That is the Borough way.This area is changing as with all of it's TV exposure over the years it is becoming a well known destination. I can see the change happening with more camera carrying tourists adding to the crowds.With the massive building works at London Bridge station and the building of the Shard tower block this area is in danger of disappearing into a sea of glass and chrome.The Southwark area is changing rapidly so visit Borough now in case the developers preserve this market by removing its taste and feel.Take a look at the guide books or websites to plan your visit as I am not sure of timings - i just know that I have been standing hungry and disappointed on a Monday wanting my Chorizo sandwich. Hmmm, reminds me of a song ........... "Tell me why I don't like Mondays".Don't worry, you won't go hungry as there is always something in the area to eat.Just one thing. Please, please, please don't tell anyone else it is where to go for the ultimate London Lunchtime food experience. It is hard enough to get through the crowds as it is!||January 20, 2013
CFitzpatrick||50||I was meeting up with a few friends to spend a whole Saturday in London. As I didn't know what your initial plan was, I decided to have a large breakfast to set me up for the day. Big mistake as we started off at Borough Market. This Market is simply amazing. There is such a diverse range of food available to eat there or to take home and enjoy later. To be honest, most of it is too good to wait for! All of the stall owners are very friendly and knowledgeable and willing to let you taste their produce. Unique stalls like the Drunk Cheese stall was quite intriguing, and the giant stack of brownies was amazing to behold. I would recommend the Borough Market to everyone of all ages and ethnicities and I would definitely recommend that you go there with a good appetite!||January 19, 2013
designdane||50||Pleasantly surprised! Didn't know what to expect but it is an all food market. Fresh homemade cheese, olives, meats, breads, sweets and anything else food wise you may desire. Great to stop by for a quick lunch bite. Try the grilled cheese sandwiches on homemade bread, four kinds of cheese, with leeks and onions, the best I have ever had!! Also try the freshly carved roast beef sandwiches with horseradish sauce and arugula, delish!!! There are so many good things share with a group so you can try as much as you can. I have also heard the duck sandwiches are terrific. My husband and son had the pork which they likened to the roast pig we had in Hawaii, sweet and tender! Can't go wrong here! Lots to do, lots to eat!||January 18, 2013
john b||40||Big food market, south of the river. Just wander round and taste lots of different things, cheese, salami, olive oil and in the middle of the market a stall with Paella, Thai Curry and Vietnamese curry - £6 a pot, but taste lots before you buy, but IT IS LOVELY. Wasted a good couple of hours here and enjoyed it thoughly!!!||January 18, 2013
Jayne101_12||50||On my last day in London and the very last place we discovered was the Borough Markets - the food section - I couldn't believe my eyes - wished I had time to sample everything and see more. When next in London I will definately be back to sample and see it all. ||January 17, 2013
Kenneth1960||50||Great atmosphere and a real foodie treat!! Close to the Tower Bridge and next to the Shard. Quirky place.||January 15, 2013
Katie B||50||My husband and I went to this market twice. The first day we tried to go later in the day and most stalls were closing up shop. We went back a few days later in the morning and it was fantastic. The produce/cheese/bakery items are so fresh and tasty. There is prepared food to eat and packaged food to buy. TONS of produce, artisan breads, sea salt, cheese, etc. There was a stand selling mulled wine and cider. I tried the wine....it was just what I needed on a chilly day. If I lived in London, I would be here constantly.||January 15, 2013
Hawklord_pxr5||50||The atmosphere here is fantastic. The sights, sounds, smells and tastes are really worth experiencing.I've wandered through a few times before when it's been quiet but this was the first time ona busy Saturday. Too many types of food and drink to mention but you can just wander around trying stuff. I defy anyone to leave hungry!Definitely going back!||January 15, 2013
Jenny B||50||This was really my top experience. There is a buzz there, a warmth and great food. The hot spiced cider was a treat on the very cold day. If I lived here , I would only shop at this market. Well worth a visit!||January 14, 2013
DanielEngles||50||If you get there before the crowds this is a great spot to start the day with plenty of options for eating and really good coffee from Monmouth Coffee||January 12, 2013
Lostpassport||50||Its a must do if you are in this part of London and to be fair, even if you are not in this part of town, make the trip especially around late morning when all the delights are in full flow. I think you could get most things here, but the range and quality of the food is exceptional, if anything its a very big decision what to have.My tip is to forget about pre planning meals for the coming days and take a big shopping bag and be inspired with some truly wonderful food!||January 10, 2013
LondonPuds||50||This is a great food market, but with a difference. They have great british foods, with some continental foods and the smell is divine. You can buy breads, cheese wines, at Christmas you get to sample mulled wine etc and it is close to other great places like London Dungeon and the clink jail so could spend the day in the area, makes a great day out||January 10, 2013
theharrogatelady||50||Wonderful market full of interesting food stalls that smell just delicious! Really great atmosphere from the stall holders who want to help and advise and the whole area around the market, is packed with interesting and specialist food shops. ||January 8, 2013
Aloofbob||50||Borough Market is badly signposted, with a clumsy layout that leaves you fairly clueless at any given point as to where you are, where you've been, or where you want to get to. The walkways are so narrow though that given the popularity of the place, movement is pretty difficult anyway.But that's because this is not an "Attraction". It's a market. It's not some anaesthetised, cookie-cutter haven of geometric perfection, it's a place where people put their stuff down and sell food.Outstanding, world-class, flavour-ful, fresh, high quality, mouth-wateringly great food. From the greatest game pie I have ever tasted (courtesy of the pieminister stand), to wild boar sausages, to mulled wine made with proper spices not a mix packet from Shwartz, to a venison stick quite brilliantly described by the vendor as "feral". It's outstanding and I wish I was there right now.||January 6, 2013
Woodychester1||50||Great to wander around and buy. Always good quality, may cost but then quality rarely comes cheap. Great for casual street dining.||January 6, 2013
SueH963||40||What a selection of food. Taste buds were running rampid!!!! Yummy empanadas and the alfaores reminded me of Uruguay plus my daughter climbing into the dulce de leche... oh and the Family Tree Cinnamon Tree Bakery, their bikkies where scrummy!!! A great hour eating and taking in the sights and smells of this yummy food market.||January 6, 2013
Harks17||50||Not too busy when we went on a Thursday and Friday. Food was amazing - we had a Borough Club sandwich at the first stall you pass on your way from the tube station and the staff there are so good with great music and more importantly, the food is fantastic and extremely generous. Also had the paella from further inside the markets which was also very good, and had a duck sandwich as well which was salty but good. The markets are so good and just make you wish you lived there so you could cook up all this food! Definitely worth a look.||January 6, 2013
iamyecenia||50||I was in Market HEAVEN! I went twice, both times on a Friday. Mostly because I hate out of control large crowds and based on other reviews, everything said to avoid Saturday, so I did and I had a great experience:). There was fresh produce, we stopped for coffee at Monmouth, bought some wonderful Parma ham, blueberry yogurt, and BEST raclette in London: Kappacasein! Looooved it!||January 5, 2013
mgc6754||40||What an interesting little gem! Could have watched people there all day long and fantastic selection of foods. Recommend the hot pork rolls with stuffing and applae sauce! (and a little cranberry sauce too!)||January 5, 2013
swisstraveller002||30||I have to admit that I saw and loved Jamie Olivers "early" TV shows (the naked chef), including where he goes to Borough Market. I love markets and really looked forward to visiting Bourough Market, but was a bit dissapointed by it. Its now really towards tourists (understandable and still dissapointing).||January 2, 2013
Trix_L4||40||Loved looking around and tasting all the different produce but found some stall very overpriced ( I believe in paying for good quality food but some stall charged too much) would recommend though for a couple of hours , breads and chutneys very nice . Would recommend you visit early as it gets very busy .||December 29, 2012
twinkletravel1||50||Fun way to spend a few hours when in town. Love all the stalls & a long wait in the queue for a coffee from Monmouth is a must!||December 29, 2012
Frenchchelsea||50||We went on a Saturday morning and the place was packed. It's a brilliant place if you love your meats and cheeses. There's plenty to buy for lunch but excellent to stick up for the week or a special meal. It's gets crowded at lunch so get there early if you wish to avoid the crowds.||December 29, 2012
f_corona_europe||50||Ppl super friendly, let's of nice photos to take! Foodies classic and home made! Nice place to stop when doing the south bank walk||December 29, 2012
sarah_gray||40||The market has so many different foods - including deli style stalls, butchers, cheese suppliers, fruit, veg and bread. It all looks great and I go at least once a year at Christmas to get some great cheeses and salamis in particular. Some of the big names have shops here - Neals Yard for cheese and Brindisa for all things Spanish. Its probably not the cheapest place and I wouldn't say that you can't get the things you can get here elsewhere - particularly with the internet - but I think its a nice place to visit and see what treats you can find. Well worth a visit - if you're in London siteseeing - add Borough Market into the day - particularly if you love food!!||December 29, 2012
Worxelminxy||40||Visited on Sunday 23rd December, wonderful magical place to visit especially just befor Christmas. The smells of cooking sausages, burgers, soup was wonderful. Pheasants strung on butchers ceilings. Turkish food, cheese, Christmas trees.Lovely visit, just a shame it's not open every Sunday.........................||December 28, 2012
JacMc61||30||I had this on my must do list while visiting London and I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed. Lots of stalls were closed ( I know it's the week between Xmas and New Year) and the rain was a problem in relation to shelter. I did have some excellent chicken curry ( at the paella stand) but I have to say I thought the prices were high. There was a variety of food places to choose from and I imagine that when everything is fully operational it would be a more positive experience. It's worth trying the chilli hot chocolate drink for something different.||December 27, 2012
Alain T||50||We loved our visit there.You can buy fresh products and eat on the market, people are friendly it's a real pleasant and singular place to visit on sundays mornings.||December 26, 2012
impavidus||40||Tucked away underneath the railways arches and just next to Southwark Cathedral Borough market has been doing a roaring trade for years. I was tempted to rate it as average as the value for money ratio of the food on offer has really declined greatly, but its uniqueness as a venue has prevented me from doing so. I would suggest avoiding rainy days though, as there is really nowhere to stand (let alone sit), so you are likely to end up eating something under the cover of your own umbrella, dodging hundreds of other people doing the same - definitely not a nice experience. There is, however, a true vibrancy about this place, as well as a huge selection of the least known and more appetising foods from all corners of the world. So in the right weather conditions Borough market remains a very good alternative to places like Harrods or Selfridges Food Halls, with a more authentic feel to it.||December 23, 2012
Lewell2008||20||This place is getting worse and worse. One stall was charging £7.50 for a single slice of cheese on toast. Another £8.25 for a sausage baguette?I wouldn't have minded but neither tasted that great. I visited on a Saturday that was raining and the roof of the railways was leaking like you would not believe, I had to use my umbrella under shelter! The area is really neglected and my friend said he saw a rat behind a stall.The place is full of camera tooting tourists and posh foodies that have more money than food sense.The sad fact is that better quality food at competitive prices can be found in Tesco’s and Sainsbury’s throughout the country.Shame it used to be such a genuinely lovely day out where good tasting food from rural areas could be obtained in the city for reasonable prices! Now it feels just a commercialised as walking into a Starbucks coffee house!!!!!||December 22, 2012
Brian C||50||We keep coming back here for the fantastic selection of food and the friendly cosmopolitan atmosphere||December 21, 2012
SpriteyChicagoland||50||This was our second trip to the market~got fish and chips @ Fish! Bread and dessert @ one of the stalls~perfect place to try all sorts of different foods in a festive atomsphere.||December 20, 2012
Chris W||50||If you love food you'll love Borough Market. Stalls from around the world, all with very good produce. Butchers and more exotic meats for sale and to eat. If you want a good breakfast try Maria's Cafe in the centre - bubble and squeak fantastic. My favourites are Sillfield Farm for wild boar, Emilia Romagna for Parmesan (get the Vacca Rossa), Brindisa for good Chorizo, Piementon and iberico ham and Neals Yard for cheese. When you have had enough shopping, go the Old Thameside Inn for a drink and if the weather is nice sit outside overlooking the Thames.||December 19, 2012
ptfc1876||50||I am a bit of a foodie and decided to visit here on Saturday really just to visit La Brindisa in the hope of getting some padron peppers for my daughter (which we did) but I am so glad we visited. It was fantastic and ended up buying tea, cheeses, vegetables, sauce .. would have bought more if we hadn't been walking round all day after that. We got there at about 10.45am after travelling from Leeds and it was just starting to get busy. We tasted lots of lovely bits and pieces and bought food from the stands for an early lunch - fantastic. Very interesting and lots of things I cannot get in Leeds. Even our 10 year old enjoyed it. By the time we left just before 12 noon it was packed though so I would advise go early - especially near Christmas. I will definately be going again when I got back to London at end of February .||December 19, 2012
gloriousdaytripper||50||Nothing beats a visit to the inspiring Borough Market after a morning walk on the Thames right bank. Many great stalls, lively atmosphere, delicious food (try the lamb burger at the beginning of the market!!)||December 17, 2012
Amanda M||50||A thoroughly amazing day out! Left the tube at St Pauls, crossed the millennium bridge and walked past the Globe to Borough Market. I arrived around 10am which meant it wasn’t packed, stall holders had the time to chat and there were samples a plenty of different cheese’s, meats, fruit and veg all available to sample. A wonderfully rich display of sights, sounds and smells , I left the market with a full bag and would recommend this to anyone who’s looking for something a bit different to enjoy! I stopped at Southwark Cathedral on the way back and arrived in time for a choral practice, what a pleasant surprise to top off an excellent morning!||December 17, 2012
MartiGianlu||50||This is a must-see place for foodies! You can easily reach Borough Market taking the "Duke Street" Exit from London Bridge tube station (about 2mins walk). Make sure you get there with an empty stomach as you will be offered loads of food to try out. There you can find anything, from spices, to British Cheeses, raw meat and fish, veggie, drinks, desserts, bread... food is British as well as from around the world and it definitely deserves a visit if you love food or photography too as you will have plenty to catch on your cameras. It's only open on Thu-Fri-Sat (Thur from 11 to 5, Fri from 12 to 6 and Sat from 8 to 5). Enjoy!||December 16, 2012
LyaMachado||50||When in London you have to go to the Borough Market! Food everywhere. And it is really good food. It seems to be the place where all the Londoners are in a Saturday afternoon. It closes at 5pm but there are several bars and restaurants in the area for dinner.||December 15, 2012
Brea B||50||Borough market will be on the top of the list of places to visit when i come back to London. The food was amazing! I was told to try fish and chips and i wanted to have a steak and kidney pie with mushy peas. This market ticked all the boxes. The food was simply devine. 9 pounds for fish and chips was a bit much but the quality is brilliant and the taste, amazing. The pies are very fresh and made from local ingredients. All you desserts are here too! Cakes, pastries, lollies...you name it. You can also buy pies, meats, cheeses and alcohol etc all to consume while there or take with you. An absolute gem!||December 14, 2012
EmmJehy||40||This is a foodie market with stalls selling posh grub, such as oysters, venison sausages, fresh paella...and gourmet food ingredients to take home. I'd recommend coming here for lunch if you're in Southwark or the Southbank. A fresh Aberdeen Angus burger will set you back for about £4.50. And it'll taste superb. I'd much rather grab food from here than the chain restaurants in the area.I came on a Thursday, and although it was busy, it was not particularly crowded. Note that the market is closed on Sundays.Enjoy!||December 14, 2012
CHRISTOPHER E||40||After leaving the peaceful confines of Southwark Cathedral, we walked through the noisy, interesting food market just a few metres away. We were able to sample and buy many unusual and traditional delicacies;there was even a stall dedicated to Welsh Cheeses. What a contrast to Southwark cathedral!||December 13, 2012
Benny1965||40||Happen to come across the wonderful place around lunch time on a Tuesday. Ordered the Hog Roast which I have to say was really good, apple sause and rocket serve on ciabatta roll. Well worth a visit to this market.||December 11, 2012
PedroNunesMartins||50||This market is very crowded on the weekend, you will walk like a tuna in a can.Even if you know what you want to buy, you'll deliver yourself to the market since it has such colorful vegetables, smelly cheeses (in the good way), sandwiches, brownies, wine, meat, pastry, you name it!We ate a Duck Sandwich, for £5 each, at one of the hundreds of counters available and it was divine!The best thing about the market is that you'll be asked if you want to taste before buying!Although some stuff are expensive, if you look carefully you'll find some that are cheaper.||December 11, 2012
HLJM||50||Wow! What an amazing place! If you love food and street food, Borough market is a great place to visit. So many different stalls with such an array of fresh foods, preserves and tasty treats......it's just a shame we were staying in a hotel and didn't have facilities to keep food cool or couldn't eat more of the prepared food on the day! We visited on a Saturday afternoon and the market was in full swing, it was really bustling and there were people everywhere you looked grazing and enjoying themselves. Great atmosphere but be prepared for a busy environment||December 11, 2012
timmkd||50||I am a London local but I always take people to this market when they come to visit. The food is amazing and you can sample so much of it withcheeses, james, meats, fudges, turkish delights, cookies, brownies and so much more. It's all super fine quality food. Come with an empty stomache!||December 11, 2012
unicorn07||50||I adore Borough Market - it should be on every tourists itinerary, and I don't think you can call yourself a Londoner until you've shopped there! When I was young, I lived a short commute away and would always go with my dad to pick up everything required for Christmas or a special occasion. It has really grown now and can get really busy, but the atmosphere is still the same. I'd recommend going quite early on a Saturday to browse before all the crowds set in, then stick around and pick a stall for lunch! I've never had a bad meal from any of the traders I've visited - you can get anything from paella to a pie, scallops to a salt beef sandwich, an ostrich steak to a reindeer burger... Be adventurous!||December 10, 2012
Munch09||40||great selection, buzzy atmosphere, fantastic variety & arrive hungry!!! Good farmers market for food & food gifts.||December 8, 2012
cocodebear||50||If You live in London then you will already know and love this place. If you're a tourist no visit to London is complete if you don't visit this market! Fact! It's a great place for all ages. You can shop for gifts, eating delicious hot/cold food from all over the world at cheap prices (eg paella/Thai curry/chicken curry for £5) Monmouth has a branch there ( voted best coffee in London). It's probably the biggest and best of all London's markets. If your gonna pick only one to visit this is it. ||December 6, 2012
Geminican||40||It only opens on Saturdays. A good place to check out if you like people watching and see how locals live, it's their #1 farmer's market. ||December 5, 2012
chris m||30||Visited borough market last Saturday the first thing you notice straight away it's really crowed so best not wear your best foot wear cause mine got totally ruined and try to pick a dry day even it's under cover u still get the odd puddles hiding away until u tread in one like me. But seeing past that you will find some amazing foods from a good old cumberland sausage hotdog to a kangaroo burger to scallop with stir fry.if your a cheese lover you won't find any problems finding some here. And if you live deserts then you must try the new york cheese cake or the German cheese cake yum. Plus loads more foods to try. Traveling. The best way is by underground but if u do decide to drive there is a hotel round the corner walking distance to the market you can park but b prepared to pay £4.50 an hourExtra the London dungeons is just across the road if that tickles your fancy too Happy eating guys ||December 4, 2012
davidcZ8663HG||40||Always worth a visit, whether it is to eat or buy. This time we did a bit of both. Choose your eating place carefully - there's always another one around the corner which you wish you had the capacity to try!||December 4, 2012
foodster||30||Borough Market is an indoor market run by the City. It is essentially several shops right next to each other in a couple of buildings. Lots of food and LOTS of people. Although this was an enjoyable visit, our expectations were set too high by the hype surrounding this particular market. It might be a good market to live near but not particularly something I would recommend as a destination. I preferred the spontaneity of Broadway market over this one. Go if you are in the vicinity.||December 4, 2012
WanderlustV||40||Specialty foods from all over the world can be found at Borough Market, everything from Southeast Asian to French cuisines. Located on the southern side of the London Bridge, Borough Market is also conveniently located close to other major London attractions, so you won't have to go far to find this unique market. Lots of free samples make it a great place to wander around and not necessarily even buy anything (probably the only place to get anything for free in a city as expensive as London).However, make sure to go during a Friday or Saturday, and not on a normal weekday. I've been before on a Saturday when it was buzzing with activity and every stall was open, and I recently went on a Tuesday afternoon, when about 60% of the stalls were closed and few people were around.||December 4, 2012
GuyNSiv||50||This market is fascinating, there are stalls of food from all over the world, this place is a cheese lover heaven.also a lot of place to grab a bite to eat.I've been to London many times before and it was my first time here||December 3, 2012
KlaudiaC||50||Words fail to describe the wonderful produce that is here. You are transported into a food Eden, each stall providing yet another mouthwatering stare. From produce to delicious food, we got lost with all our senses as we strolled with a hot cider in hand ! One thing to note it gets busy so try going a bit earlier before the big crowds. ||December 2, 2012
VargaOrsi||40||the Borough market is the last market this type in the downtown of London. I visited on Thursday and friday aswell. You always can find something warm to drink while you cruise areound the veg and meat-stands.It should not be compared to the NAschmarkt in Vienna but it is a grest surprise to find such a location in this part of London.||December 2, 2012
Stefan J||50||Great market with everything from tea, goats-milk ice cream, exotic meats and British cheese. Come here early in the morning and spend an hour or more just walking around looking, smelling and tasting. Pick up a great lunch from different stalls and finish of with the goats-milk ice cream - it was one of a kind.||December 2, 2012
Tracyonhols||50||Only drawback to this wonderful marketplace is the weekend crowds. Such a great atmosphere for central London. Extensive variety of great foods some a little pricey but what a pleasure to shop like this away from the neon over packaged hell of large supermarkets. ||December 1, 2012
JanRotherham||50||We visited the Borough Market for the first time this trip and wished we had come across this little gem before. It is such an interesting place with all the different food types and it has a lovely atmosphere. We really enjoyed trying some of the take away food that was on offer and will certanly call again when we visit London next time.||December 1, 2012
bof781||50||We had pies, mash, peas and grave at one of the stalls. Really good. We walked around and enjoyed the smells of cheeses, bought some mulled cider, and just relaxed. A nice food market. A bit more British or mediterranean than for example the Camden markets. Recommended.||November 30, 2012
Michelle D||50||Fantastic trip to the market, enjoyed pottering around a place I have heard a lot about, I wish I had visited before now.You must go...||November 30, 2012
Tobyco||50||I lived in London 30 years ago, I worked in London as well. And now my daughter and family live here. After being here all together for years, I went yesterday to the market for the first time!And I went on the suggestion of an artisinal cheese shop owner in my home town in Ct who told me to go primarily for the best toasted cheese sandwich in the world. I concur.....totally worth it ( their own cheese grated with leeks, garlic and shallots)and all what else the market has to offer. It's all food stalls. You will find the cheese sandwich in the green market and can't miss it and while you're there, across the way is a French stall from Normandie with the most delightful salesman, cheeses and charcuterie.Come to think of it we shared a toasted salted beef and pickle sandwich on our way out!||November 30, 2012
textravel0456||50||This market has everything including fresh fruit, cheeses, meats, olives, hot spiced wine or cider and more. Definitely come hungry and sample and eat your way through the market and be sure to buy plenty to take home as well. ||November 30, 2012
32billw||50||What a fantastic place to spend an hour wandering around food stalls of all shapes, colours and sizes. Great restaurants on the fringes too. Love it as a venue to take the numerous friends and relatives who visit 'one' in London!||November 30, 2012
Lyn F||50||This food market is open Thursday Friday and Saturday and should be visited. Breads, cakes, cheese, fish, meat, fruit vegetables, drinks, honey, oils, coffee and so much more. Taste a lot of goods before you buy. The vibrant colours and the aromas of the produce on offer send the taste buds into overdrive. Go try for yourself. Forget the West End and give the markets a go.||November 27, 2012
angela-yate||50||Being a complete foodie I have been trying to get to Borough Market which is situated right by London Bridge. I eventually managed to get there a couple of weeks back and was not disappointed. I was amazed with the selection of fresh food and bread that was available. The fish and meat stalls were a feast to behold and the colourfully displayed fruit and veg stalls were a work of art with unusual varieties of carrots, potatos, cauliflowers and much more. Hot food was also available for hungry tourists and locals alike. The delicious aroma of paella and giant susages along with caribbean dishes not only was an appatising site but the aroma of cooking filled the air, making it hard to believe you were in the heart of London but on an exotic trip to far away places. Will definately visit Borough Market very soon to stock up with more goodies..||November 26, 2012
motags||40||Outdoor market offering an array of foods, spices, wines, and cheeses. Loved the hubbub of the market and the interesting offerings. Even though it was pouring rain, it was crowded and lively. Enjoyable experience.||November 25, 2012
ScottyG837||50||If you love food, wine, organic everything go here !!! Pubs close by, great food stands walk around with a wine or cider in hand and enjoy...... A must do in London..... Put it this way every time we come to London we take a good half a day out to walk around and take it all in (wine n food) that is......||November 24, 2012
lanag67||50||This London food and drink market is amazing, well worth a visit!!Lots of great food to try. I recommend the fish and chips.||November 23, 2012
micolm981||40||If you are closed to the City and you want to see the market of your dreams....please: go for Borough! It's wonderful thanks to the colourful bench of fruits and vegetables; you will be able to find fresh fish in great conditions and a lot of species that you don't usually find in shops.The meet is great: pork, mince, but also game of high quality. It's a bit more expansive that usual but If I could live in London I should buy fruits, vegetables, and fish in Borough!Look also for first fruits: amazing!It's a terrific place also for looking and smelling! Be careful if you are dieting: I would suggest you to avoid the cakes and sweet side of the market! If you aren't dieting: help yourself (paying, of course).||November 23, 2012
Hilary P||50||I just love this place. On a visit to London we rented an apartment just around the corner. We spent several hours mooching around. The place is full of goodies for people who love good food.My friend and I are both vegetarian. We are used to being marginalised but here there were more choices for vegetarians than we are used to. If you don't eat meat and care for animals there are some places here that you have to avoid. However, that is the case almost everywhere anyway.There was lots of vegetarian food available. We filled our bags and went back to our accommodation rejoicing. For carnivores this must be heaven.If you love food and find yourself in the area of Borough/London Bridge don't miss this.||November 21, 2012
jengtravels||40||This is an open-air market by London Bridge with specialty food vendors from all over the UK and some from the continent. Not great for a vegetarian, but still wonderful to stroll through and experience. ||November 20, 2012
ClumsyMumbles||50||I could walk around this market forever, savouring the sights, sounds, smells and of course the tastes of this delightful food heaven||November 20, 2012
jumeirah_queen||50||I was there on Saturday...had couple bites to eat..mulled wine, lovely grilled cheese sandwich, roasted pork belly at roast, and chorizo sandwich. It's a great place to eat great food, hangout, and spend a leisurely afternoon after spending time indoors in a musuem.||November 18, 2012
wherenextexactly||50||We went on a Saturday and stopped by on our way to The Globe. It was heaving but the atmosphere was brilliant and it was hard to decide what to have for lunch!We settled on Pieminister and we were astounded. Top quality food at a very reasonable price! Washed down with hot cider, but I can't remember the stall name, sorry. We were stuffed but there were lots of delicious-looking fruits and cakes we would have liked to have tried if we'd had the time.The stallholders were very jovial and the place was bustling with life. Excellent photo opportunities and so much fantastic choice. The only negative I would say is that there is little space to sit and eat your food so occasionally you do get knocked and jostled whilst trying to enjoy your pie!||November 18, 2012
JemBrisbane||40||We strolled from Westminster Houses of Parliament across the bridge and turned left towards the Aquarium. At 18pds entry we gave this a miss and wandered along the Southbank riverside taking in the delightful stalls of handicrafts, street performers and foodd stalls.With a mulled wine to warm our hands (and stomachs) we carried on down to Blackfriars bridge and towards the Golden Hind, tucked between higgh rise modern buildings.Just behind it we found Borough market where we enjoyed the busy atmosphere and sampled the many cheeses, breads and condiments from around the world.It's a great place to grab a sandwich, freshly cooked, or something more substantial - fissh and chips, paella and all sorts of exotic sausages. All washed down with speciality beers, ciders or even mulled cider.It's a friendly place to wander around and taste London life at it's best.||November 16, 2012
LargelyMonk||40||The regeneration of this area of London is now matched by the continuing development of London Bridge and The Shard. There is a vast variety of fresh food available , fish, meat, breads, cheeses and many stalls offer snacks using their ingredients. The chorizo sandwich from Brindisi is filling although at nearly £5 it should be. There are several pubs in the market itself and the whole area has a lively atmosphere especially at this time of year. Go with a full wallet as none of the wares on offer are cheap.||November 16, 2012
Anon_ymes2013||50||Great food, nice pubs, all tucked away under the viaduct of London Bridge railway. The decor and feel of the place transports one back in time around a century, but without the smell of raw sewage nor the prevalence of pickpockets. ||November 16, 2012
CarltonA10||30||The market has become a tourist attraction as well as a trendy lunch hotspot for nearby office workers. Presently there is construction work going on above the market on the overhead rail bridges. However it is definately worth seeing if you are in the area. For food shopping it is first class having a good selection of meat, fish and vegetables as well as various outlets for coffee and snacks etc. There are several other attractions within walking range including: Southwark Cathedral, Golden Hind Replica and The Shard Viewpoint. Get there via London Bridge Station which is nearby.||November 14, 2012
GWhitneyG||50||Borough Market has become my favorite place in London. If you are in London when the market is open, gather a few friends together and do what we call the Borough Market scavenger lunch. Each person heads off with a set amount to spend, and then you all meet up and have an amazing urban picnic/feast. Best if you are meat lovers, but there are many strong veggie options as well.||November 14, 2012
boba543||50||We stumbled across this place one weekday. What a wonderful collection of bakeries, snack places, a great beer store, coffee shop, etc. Much smaller than Spitifields or Pettycoat, but that's fine. ||November 12, 2012
Tim K||40||I love Borough Market for two reasons, One the wonderful choice of food available from the stalls and two the nature of the stall holders and their ability to make you smile, however the market is as much a tourist attraction as it is a place to shop now and is becoming increasingly busier and a less attractive place to visit to pick up lovely food.The challenge is getting the balance right and at the moment this is just not happening, building work on the sight is not helping also. Please take out a few stalls to make a bit of space for the customer to be able to move from stall to stall without getting crushed.Good place to shop and I see the attraction for the tourists but not at the loss of business from loyal customers surely?||November 12, 2012
amitchella||50||A great place for lunch or dinner. A wonderful way to sample multiple cuisines at a very reasonable price. There is even a place providing champagne. A fun way to spend a few relaxing hours.There are also several great restaurants in the market if you want a more comfortable place to sit and enjoy.||November 10, 2012
John H||50||One of my favorite things to do if I'm in London on a Saturday. Great stalls, great veg, great food especially the grilled cheese sandwiches and racolette. Great place for photo hounds.||November 10, 2012
SkipK||40||Borough Markets seems frantic no matter what day or time. It has a vast range of ready to eat foods, as well as fresh produce at reasonable prices. The retailers are happy to assist with your selection of produce & cooking tips.Public seating is lacking but if you don't mind grabbing a bit of gutter it is ok.||November 9, 2012
Colin_Giles||50||Caters for all foodies looking for something unusual or difficult to find elsewhere. Fresh fruit & veg in abundance at low prices surrounded by street food stalls make this a tourist attraction as well as a shoppers market. Taste your way around the hundreds of samples. Take your camera to show the folks back home the displays and the atmosphere minutes walk from London Bridge rail stations. Southwark Cathedral and Europes tallest building 'the Shard' are adjacent attractions. Saturday mornings are the best time to visit. Virtually no public car parking in the area but ample bus and tube service to the whole of London.||November 9, 2012
katherinel102||50||Great place to sample some of the finest foods -loads of stalls offering free tasters, and really good quality ingredients -including meats and veg, cheese, speciality oils, chocolates, patisserie, etc. Ohh heaven. Also good place to meet up with people for a Saturday lunch as there's a wealth of hot fast food stalls ranging from Spanish to German, etc. Bustling with people, and beware of your wallet -I've never been a victim of pickpocketing but I could imagine in the throngs of people you could be targeted -so always zip it up and know where it is at all times. ||November 8, 2012
lisasubaisabroad||40||Noisy market under London bridge, next to Southwark Church. We saw overpriced touristy fish restaurant adn luckily found a small fish buffet on the corner in about 4 min from the stairs. This place had the best fish & chips in town. We also tried the pies. (chicken with fungi and salmon pies were great however cheespie was horrible- as it was filled in with sour potatoe stew.) Go there early afternoon as morning hours were rather quiet.||November 8, 2012
Stephen F||40||Busting to the brim with quality food and a great atmosphere a truly fab market. If you love sampling everything from cheese to hog roast head down there on a Friday or Saturday. Grab your lunch before the rush as it gets rediculously busy at peak. All part of its charm of course. ||November 6, 2012
David W||10||The title says it all really. We went with a local, (who was gobsmacked at it being closed) on a Sunday at about 11.30 in the morning to find literally only one stall/shop open. This was annoying, as we had travelled over a hundred miles to get there.All the signage around the market said "Open".My advice would be check that it is actually open if you are planning a journey to visit. But how you could confirm that it was REALLY open I do not know. Thankfully, it being London, there were other things to do instead.Perhaps whoever runs the market could make more effort to inform the public of its opening hours and days.||November 6, 2012
jonnyboy13317||40||Visited borough market on a saturday its is a great place lots to see and try, many differant foods and smells.It is obvios that some people try and take advantage as samples to try are to small to taste lol so you have to ask the satll holder in watched a few people being told of for taking to much!!Its a bit expensive but you pay for the fun of it all many of the foods could be purchased cheaper in super markets.The Oysters were exceptional but again pricey i suggest you visit Mersea Island for better vaalue etc.||November 5, 2012
weberfamily||50||South of London Bridge and in the shadow of "the Shard" this is the ultimate multi-cultural gastronomic adventure. Dozens of stalls selling the most tempting array of fresh and cooked food from all over the UK, Europe and, yes, the world! Visit their excellent website to find out more, and don't eat anything before you go. ||November 5, 2012
tarabyrne2||40||Borough Market is a sensory overload. You will use all your sense here and its amazing what you may find. Ingredients, homemade food and restaurants for every type of food. Its fun just to walk around and see the different stalls and people there. I take all my friends who visit from the US here.||November 5, 2012
bocadey||50||The market consists of several parts: a number of permanent stalls selling wine, cheese, organic produce and goods imported from other parts of Europe; carts selling local produce, artisan foods, take-away meals and sweets; several side streets and alleys featuring gourmet shops and restaurants, as well as the enormous Vinopolis wine museum, which was closed when we went there; and a new market hall that was still under construction during our visit.We spent a while wandering around Borough Market before buying anything. We scoped out the numerous wine shops and tried a sample of amazingly delicious Zamorano cheese paired with quince jelly at Brindisa, a lovely shop specializing in Spanish food. By then, we had worked up an appetite. One of the seafood stalls at Borough Market featured three enormous woks filled with freshly made paella, Thai curry and a Vietnamese stir-fry. All three were made with the same seafood, and perhaps their theme was international rice-based dishes. They were all incredible, and, despite looking almost identical, very authentic tasting. It was a tough decision, we settled on the paella along with some falafel and freshly-squeeze juice from nearby stalls. It was pure lunch perfection, made even better with the addition ginger fudge for dessert.Borough Market is ideal for those of us whose idea of the perfect afternoon is looking at, tasting and smelling various kinds of gourmet food. You can’t spend a whole day there, but it’s a great lunch stop along the way to the Tate Modern, Globe Theatre and other South Bank attractions.||November 4, 2012
Claudia R||50||Come here on Saturday morning and spend at least an hour tasting amazing fresh-baked bread, paella, cappuccino, smoothies, chutney, jam -- you will love it. Everyone can find something to enjoy, whether you a vegan gobbling the veggie burgers or a sausage-lover.||November 4, 2012
ylvse||40||A really nice place with lot's of charm, fresh fruits, vegetables and take away food. You grab some fish and chips or a steak sandwich and enjoy the atmosphere. Quite crowed with many tourists though. But that just adds to the feeling. And why not end the visit with a fantastic cup of coffee just outside the market at Monmouth café. ||November 1, 2012
Annabel M||50||It was fantastic to 'stumble' upon this market, had no idea it was there until we walked into it. A super little food market, hot food for sale as well as fresh fish, cheese, fruit and veg., bread. Some souvenirs too in the form of tea towels, pottery etc. Quite a lot of local beer and some wine.||October 31, 2012
evieb_11||50||Being real foodies and having rented an apartment in Shad Thames on a recent London visit, we visited this market to shop for produce so we could cater in some of the meals. We were absolutely enchanted by this sprawling market set out under the old brick railway arches , with a fabulous atmosphere and exceptionally friendly stall holders . The choice of fresh produce was eye popping, a fish counter which had us confused with the wide range of choice , a rainbow of fruit and vegetables with mushroom varieties I've never seen before , delicious baked goods , all sorts of sausages and meats from around the world . Most stall holders had tasting plates and were very happy to impart knowledge without pushing for sales. The market has some very nice and trendy shops on the periphery and the atmosphere is just great ! The juxtaposition of the new Shard building from behind the market with the old antiquated market buildings makes for a wonderful pic . There are several great spots to eat street food, our favourite were the salt beef sandwiches with pickles and lashings of mustard . This market is held every Thursday, Friday and Saturday with the very best produce on display on Thursday which is the best day to go for seeing everything looking pristine but if you're after bargains go on Saturday afternoon when the stall holders put in a special pitch to sell off remaining produce with friendly amusing banter at knockdown prices .||October 30, 2012
Amlodhi||50||Almost every form of high-quality fresh produce is here, and the quality really is very high - meat, vegetables, fruit, dairy products - the best in the UK sell here. Sadly, most tourist groups and others also now know it's here, and prices have risen accordingly. If you can afford it, then certainly shop here as you won't find better, but you are increasingly paying through the nose for it. Sad - but I still love it!||October 27, 2012
Gerard D||40||One of the most crowded markets I have ever visited. On a Saturday lunchtime it seemed that all London had turned out. However, it was great experience and one shouldn't be put off by all of the jostling. A huge range of food and drink was on offer. We tried a delicious wild boar pie and a "pick and mix" salad, followed by coffee - a simple but great meal after a morning walking through the city. Handy for the attractions in the London Bridge area and HMS Belfast.||October 26, 2012
Kristiina V||50||a sign of a big city. this market shows how it's really done. the endless amount of articles sold in and the quality of it all. had an awakening really. must visit again, whenever possible.||October 26, 2012
Hannah M||50||Fantastic atmosphere where you can spend a few hours grazing on any kind of deliciousness that you fancy! I would avoid the temptation to fill up on one big dish so you still have room to sample things as you see them (sooo many lovely bakery stalls to name but one variety). The queues for hot food can be a bit bonkers (I visited on a Saturday) but it's definitely worth it. Just go see for yourself, you won't regret it :-)||October 26, 2012
Acanda||40||It was towards late afternoon when we visited, so perhaps too late to get a full experience of the place. However, the various food stalls still open were amazing. We stopped at the mushroom stall and could not believe how many varieties there were! Just had to purchase something, so bought some purple ones (and yes they tasted great). All stall-holders were very friendly and we had to hold back so that we did not buy at every place we stopped! If in the area you must visit. We plan another trip there when back in 'the smoke' (London to those who are a little confused).||October 26, 2012
Leslie M||40||Having been to London on a number of occasions and having done most of the major tourist attractions we wanted to do the lesser and more local attractions. We settled on doing the markets, of which there is no shortage in London and in particular the more famous food markets. Borough is one such market which is set in a most interesting location. One is transformed back to the medieval times but with a modern twist.From the entrance to the end (I still don't know which) there is food and produce in abundance for all tastes and desires. I cannot imagine anyone who visits this market, not buying and eating something before exiting. This is certainly one of the nicer markets to visit and will be a certainty on my list the next time I'm in London||October 25, 2012
ConstantTravels||50||We discovered this place purely by accident. We had wrapped a tour at the Tower of London and stopped at Wagamama for a quick bite. Our server mentioned this market to us so we decided to check it out. Great recommendation. From prosecco to the best duck confit sandwhich I have ever had to the people watching and the fantastic and ecclectic shopping; the Borough Market should be a must see/visit for anyone traveling to or living in London. We were there during happy hour time or whatever the time is after work in London is called. I can't say enough good things about it. My wife and 15 month old enjoyed all the sites and sounds of the busy market after work. It is very family friendly ... surprisingly ... even after work. Again ... this is a must see/visit.||October 25, 2012
gratzmichael1||40||Great fun and food. Some of the best cheese that I have ever had. Bought a sandwich at one of the stands found a place to sit and indulged in people watching.||October 25, 2012
CindyAdentures||50||Fantastic selection of artisinal products. Small and manageable market near the Tate Moderrn with a tube station right there.||October 24, 2012
Colin M||50||Each time we visit London we always go to Borough Market at least once for lunch. Although there was a lack of stalls, perhaps Monday is a bad day there was no shortage of atmosphere. We had lunch from one of the stalls, I had wild boar and venison with red wine and apricots in a soft roll and my wife went for the chicken version. What a taste sensation. Thoroughly enjoyed and certainly recommended. Can't wait to go back.||October 23, 2012
JLCToronto||40||Wow, we just didn't know what to eat first when we arrived at the market. Each stall was so delicious looking I wanted to buy everything. We ended up walking around with some delicious smoothies and snacking on french pastries. For lunch, we couldn't resist the take out fish and chips at Fish! - the best we'd had in London.||October 22, 2012
JoKnits||50||We wandered and loved the cacophony of things happening. Very crowded on Saturday afternoon so if you hate crowds beware. We ate at Cafe Brood which had paella and chorizo sandwiches, and pitchers of sangria - outdoor tables available, very good and great location for people-watching.||October 21, 2012
chociq||40||Lots to see and shop here. Though it's not biggest I've been to. Especially love the food area (Green Market area). Do try one of the stall called Kappacasein.||October 18, 2012
Va2Broadway||50||All of the shops, and sounds, and smells. Borough market is just a great place to spend a day. I really like all of the food carts if you want to get a great breakfast or lunch check them out. It is normally a very active and busy place but some days it can be quiet especially in the morning, so if you just want to relax and explore go then, if you want the real experience go during one of the crazy times.||October 18, 2012
KiaMathieson||50||First visit to Borough market, felt like a child in a sweet shop, didn't know which whay to turn first, so much to watch, savour and experience. A fantastic variety of fresh food and drinks to try and buy, Will definately return.||October 17, 2012
Brannigans||40||Borough are my fave markets in London. They are great for the food, deli options, organic and high quality produce, and most of all the experience. Bustling, busy, noisy and popular they are not for you if you don't like crowds. Watch your purse and phone at all times too. Best advice is look around and either get something yummy to eat or maybe a cheeky cake and a coffee and then relax eating it next door in the grounds of the lovely southwark cathedral! ||October 15, 2012
Ainslie C||30||went to borough market for the first time ever! Great freshly baked bread, market stalls to rummage through and a relaxed atmosphere around trendy people, theres so much to do||October 15, 2012
Graeme L||50||This is a wonderful place to visit even on a rainy day and is a "must" for me when visiting London. I went specifically to visit Neal's Yard to buy cheese, some of the best British cheeses available anywhere. The staff are knowledgeable and helpful if you are a novice when it comes to British cheese. There is also a Laithwaite's wineshop nearby with a great selection of wines from all over the world.||October 11, 2012
wwrj||50||We went to the Borough Market -accessed by the Tube to London Bridge-- on a Saturday morning. It was jam packed with people and vendors which contributed to the whole adventure. The market is huge and filled with fresh vegetables, prepared food, meats, fish, cheeses and breads, etc. Lots of tasting, lots of color, and just a great experience. Long line ups for the favourite stall foods, a special Italian section. Whether you are a foody or not, this is a must visit in London. We only had 1 1/2 hours to browse and that really wasn't enough.||October 11, 2012
millie t||40||This is one of my favourite places to take any people who come to visit me in London. You can spend an entire afternoon just browsing the wide range of stalls, and if you're looking to buy a gift it's the perfect place. They have stalls selling all sorts of home made and artisan goods, with stallholders from all over the world. It's an absolute must if you are a cheese fan, and the cupcakes and brownies are out of this world!||October 11, 2012
joyfultraveller_10||50||Grazing the food stalls was a blast! They offer upscale fare of a wide range of foods, from chocolates, ice cream, cheese, olives, patés, bread and ...We ate a sinfully rich lunch from the take-out stall for the restaurant Roast, a sandwich of roasted pork belly and crackling (moist and delicious!). The vendors are not there every day, so check the opening times. We went on a Friday and were in awe, but have heard there are even more vendors on Saturday.||October 9, 2012
328sandip||50||This outdoor market is amazing! I used to work in a Pub around the corner from this market in the 90's and it was still in operation but just a market.They have put a ton of money into rejuventing this area and is definately worth walking through the market. There are many vendors with food, drinks, organic items a great place to stop for lunch which touring London. This market goes back hundreds of years and there are many little pathways leading into and through the market which are amazing! I was so pleasantly surprised by the area and the offerings I went back the next day. It is also right by London Bridge tube station, and the newest building The Shard.Take a walk around the whole area and experience old London, then walk down to the embankment along the river. What a great day!||October 9, 2012
becky7739||50||wow !!! if you like food this place is a must we spent hours just looking and teasting all sorts of things even my 11year old loved it you have got to go ||October 7, 2012
Agile_Lapin||50||I always come here when on business in London. I brought my wife here recently and she had a great time. She loved the sausage and the sweets and the brownies and the pies. We had a great time noshing around the whole place.||October 6, 2012
PaulaJayneWA||50||Wall to wall food from the everyday to the slightly more exotic, from sweet to savory with a terrific atmosphere. Samples available of everything.....just eat and drink your way round. ||October 6, 2012
Scots L||50||"Expensive, delicious, eclectic, worth it". These words were given by my husband. To explain a little further I need to mention that Borough Market attracts artisan food producers and providers from across Europe. Fish, game, mushrooms, pies, vegetables, cheeses, breads, butter, raw milk, continental and north african foods, wines, ciders, hot chorizo in a roll, french sea salts, herbs, spices, teas, cordials, dips and marinades, the list goes on. Stalls vary somewhat from time to time, and there are definitely fewer on a Thursday than on Friday and at the weekend.Expect it to be busy on Fridays with lots of City workers in addition to holidaymakers and visitors. Close to the river, the City with all its history, including the Tower of London, the Monument and so on, the market is right beside Southwark Cathedral as well.Look out for the Ubriaco cheese....heavenly!||October 5, 2012
AndreaB361||50||A great place for foodies to visit, enjoy all the exquiste food and add a glass of prosecc for that treat - rememeber to take a full purse as it is a little on the pricey side - well worth a visit though!||October 4, 2012
wirewiper||50||If you have any interest in food, I can highly recommend Borough Market.The Market has a long history, having been established at the south end of London Bridge in Medieval times when the Bridge was the sole crossing of the River Thames.The location is hugely atmospheric, being held partly in the Victorian glazed Market Hall beneath the railway viaduct; framed on one side by Dickensian buildings and narrow streets, and on the other by the magnificent Southwark Cathedral, which is worth a visit in its own right. Nowadays the Market has re-invented itself as a Gourmet's paradise. Great British food, meat, fish, fruit and veg, cheeses and more, as well as unusual imports from Europe and beyond. Plenty of places to buy takeaway snacks too - this is probably one shopping trip you should make BEFORE you eat!OK the prices are sometimes expensive. But you are paying for quality. And just browsing costs nothing. Open Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with extra openings in the run-up to Christmas - check the website for details. With all the festive produce this is a particularly delightful time to visit.||October 4, 2012
Cazzy0208||50||This was our second trip to the market about a year after our first and we couldn't get over how much is now filled with tourists. You have to go on an empty stomach as there is tasters and stalls with so much you want to try. Sadly we had no fridge were we were staying or we would have bought some of the lovely cheese to take home with us. If you do have tasters from the stall holders please make sure you thank them we saw so many people taking food and not saying anything. The market is easy to access from London Bridge tube station and you get a great view of the Shard thrown in for free. There are even a couple of nice pubs nearby if you need to sit down and have a liquid refreshment to fortify you to start walking round all over again!I recommend going about 10am before it gets too crowded (the market not the pub!).||October 2, 2012
aznmadscience||50||This place has become my all-time favorite place to visit in London! I could spend hours, almost days in this place! I tried to buy and taste something from every place at Borough Market, but I probably touched only a quarter of vendors on hand. While it can get completely crowed with locals and visitors, it's inspiring how food brings people together! I can't wait to return soon!||October 1, 2012
the427||50||I have heard of Borough Market but have never found the time to go but im glad I made the time as this place is great. We got there around 10am and it was nice, busy, but would was able to look at all the stalls. By noon it was heaving and was tricky to get in and around people. This market has alot to offer, from home made sauces, pies, cakes to a few fishmongers and butchers, cider and wine makers and the main market its self.Its quite pricey, but worth it for an afternoon out.Overall I cant wait to go back again||October 1, 2012
Samiloupepperell||50||WE have visited this market on many occasions but now live close enough to go every week if we so wish, and it's great! There's a wide range of foods on offer at prices to suit all budgets, there's plenty of places to grab a bite to eat or drink, and a really good atmosphere. It is easy to walk to from London Bridge station and great fun to see all of the tourists looking up mesmerised by the sight of the Shard! It's also very easy to wander to the South Bank for a walk along the Thames.||October 1, 2012

SMEMBoston_Ma||50||I am staying near the Borough Market and I was glad that I ventured out to see what it was all about on a weekend. open Thurs, Fri and Sat, this is a great experience for locals and tourists alike. Food, shopping, and enough people watching to entertain one for hours. Go and have breakfast or lunch, stroll the food stalls and pick something up for your home or hotel. Plenty to browse, see and eat! A terrific experiences.||September 29, 2012
RobertChew-MY||40||Best to go with your family or someone that you can share your food with as you will be able to have much more varieties of food! Go around 9am as noon the place will be crowded. Things are not cheap and we end up spending more GBP 30 for food and drinks for 3 person. Nonetheless, it's a. Worthwhile experiences as your are able to sample great varieties of meat, cheese and pastries. Best way to reach there is via underground stopping at London Bridge Station and you will see the market upon exit ||September 29, 2012
Tracy H||50||Borough Market is a mecca for foodies, if you're planning a special dinner and want to impress or just need that elusive ingredient you wont find in Tesco or Waitrose this is the place for you. Get there early and treat yourself to the tastiest bacon sarnie you've ever had. Borough Market is a real experience, the meat and cheese vendors are amazing quality and you will find aromatic breads and the best chocolate brownies in London, if not the world!!||September 28, 2012
SCTiger296||50||This market is a must visit when you are in London. Grab a great lunch while you are there. Try the big pots of curry or the assortment of smoothies and meats, while sipping on a glass of fruity sangria. There are many free bites to sample. Be sure to head over to the sweets and try the candies and baked goods. This is a foodie's delight!||September 27, 2012
Njh131||50||Anyone who has a passion for food or drink will love Borough Market. We spent two hours looking around and were very impressed. You can find a great choice of food for lunch and its an ideal place to stock up with, sauces, spices and quality meats to name a few items on sale.||September 24, 2012
fredEssex||50||Wow. My brother in law has been on about this place for years. So finally we got to go with them and visit Borough Market. All this time I have been missing a fantastic London Market. If you are into good foods and wines this place is where to go. Most of the sellers are more than happy to let you have a sample to taste as well as the numerous stalls that cook there produce. So don't eat before you visit as you will need every inch of room for all the lovelly food. This aside the atmosphere here is alive with the smells of all the wonderfull foods and being situated under the railway arches you feel you have gone back in time. When food was made of natural ingrediants.||September 23, 2012
The_romantic||50||Loads of different food and drink and a great fun day out to explore another part of London with loads of different types of market stalls to look at mainly food and drink come out of London Bridge tube and follow your noseAlso try the food festival behind Southbank great food near Waterloo||September 23, 2012
Tim M||40||Visited on a Saturday so it was BUSY! Good atmosphere, loads of choice when it came to lunch - pub, restaurants, posh fish and chips, in door out door - almost too much to choose from. Not cheap but good - go with an empty belly and a full wallet for maximum enjoyment - we then walked along the embankment past The Shard and HMS Belfast to Tower Bridge. Over the Bridge to The Tower of London, the wife managed another quick ice cream here from Ben & Jerrys!!! then along the river back to London Bridge and off home on the Tube via Monument / Bank. Full day, full stomach - try it for yourself.||September 21, 2012
Cragnet||50||Great place to graze and take home some exotic food - always enjoy going there and not been disappointed yet ..... if you like spices and spicy food take some time to browse||September 21, 2012
Mike E||50||The first thing my wife and I did after we got off our flight was to go to the Boroughs Market and grab some wine, cheese, olives, and meat. It's a great, quick, inexpensive lunch or (what we did) save it for dinner back at the hotel. The vendors were very friendly and the selections of British cheeses at the market was great.||September 19, 2012
omfalcon||50||It's a very good place to have a fast lunch. I recomend the Tapas Brindisi, we had chorizo sandwich and it was delicious. The Kappacasein will be the next experience. Their grilled cheese and racletees looked and smelled like heaven. Burough Market is a good place to wander around looking at the amazing food and ingredients.I read about it in the website "youngandfoodish".Enjoy!||September 17, 2012
Sal72||40||I'm sure Jamie Oliver has left his aura here - from the incredible display of mushrooms to the muffins, the French yoghurts and interesting breads. The Morroccan food was especially lovely.||September 17, 2012
VickyLeeds||40||If you like food this is a nice place for a stroll if the weathers nice. We spent about an hour or so wandering around. Some of the food seemed a little on the expensive side, everything seems to start at £5 for a sandwhich etc; however the portions are big and it's all homemade (in front of you). There's lots to choose from for a bite to eat, I'm lad we went but wouldn't rush back.||September 16, 2012
VickyHoward||50||Me and my partner went on a Friday and was everything we expected we walked here from the tate modern and took us up to 20 min and this is us having a leisurely stroll. It has everything from venison chorizo to beer chesse, truffle olive oil to a craft beer stall called utobeer. We recommend you try the oyster stall 2 for £3. We also had a great duck sandwich from the stall opposite the Market Porter pub. The only problem was I wanted to buy everything and I couldnt because we was on holiday and had no fridge. This is a great food market and well worth the visit.||September 16, 2012
thinkpol||50||I LOVE this market! My personal favorite is the amazing Utobeer. It does get terribly well populated during the day on Saturdays though, so if you can, plan your visit on Saturday mornings instead - or avoid Saturdays there altogether and visit on a Friday or Thursday.||September 15, 2012
Rana Y||40||This is a great way to spend your afternoon, lots of food options and drinks. However it could be a little expensive for what they are offering but still worth the visit !||September 14, 2012
Eva G||50||A great open market! Ok a little bit expensive, cause this is London! But really it is worth a visit there! Check their web to know when are everything are open! Great fish and chips we ate there!||September 7, 2012
1_Can_Do_Mom||50||My daughter and I were wandering about London on our second day there when we chanced upon the Borough Market. What a serendipitous find! We happened to be out and about on gray Thursday morning and so the market was all but deserted.It is filled with all types of food vendors from seafood to pastries to fresh produce and cheeses. We were still feeling the effects of jet lag and so decided to just wander and not make any purchases as we didn't want to haul the bounty around the Tower of London for the rest of the day.Instead, we made plans to return. When we did make it back about a week later, it was a sunny, Saturday afternoon. It was like a completely different place. Overrun with tourists (such as ourselves, ha!) it had a zoo-like atmosphere. I am happy for the vendors that they were doing such good business but I much preferred our first, quiet visit.Even so, we had lovely sandwiches and bought some delicious bread and cheese to enjoy back our English relatives' home. No complaints there, everything we procured at the market was delicious. It is my hope to return to England next year and if we do you can bet that the Borough Market will be on our must-see list.||September 7, 2012
78Cal||40||This is an expensive market though well worth a visit, also with pleanty of free samples so ideal if you touring London and want to visit just before lunch time. Try and avoid Saturdays as it is busy, and don't be shy taking the samples. ||September 6, 2012
wunderlast||40||this is a really fun and large market that we visited on a saturday afternoon. we enjoyed trying samples of cheese, meats, and other specialty treats (hello, truffle honey, anyone?). there are plenty of gourmet grocery booths and food stalls (if you need a serious meal). there seemed to be an excessive amount of tables selling cheese and cured meats though. try the shop with the duck confit sandwich and sangria for 8 pounds. ||September 5, 2012
JosephCartaphilus||30||I was expecting much more of this market after reading some reviews and hearing some comments. It's nice! But I thought that it would be bigger and with many more offers, options and shops. After visiting Camden Town with all its markets and all its crowd, it's hard to find Borough Market good enough :( Still, the same feature makes it a nice place to hang out on a Sunday when you don't feel like seeing too many people around :)||September 5, 2012
mathelaci||40||Lots of interesting food, some of it overpriced. Good place to have lunch and I would definitely go again. During lunchtime it becomes very busy so if you dont like crowds avoid midday.||September 4, 2012
mmmNorthCarolina||40||Traditionally the open air farmers market in London dating back to the 1700’s, under a railroad track. Now mostly a tourist destination with locally crafted and international food, fish, meat, and vegetable stalls. Don’t eat until you get there. Chicken curry, Thai chicken, and paella cooked in large pans delicious, as were many of the baking and candy samples and cooked pies. Try the salt caramel crumbly fudge as well as the chocolate-covered honeycomb. Oyster restaurant (Wright Brothers) across street was overpriced... all varieties of oysters salty… not sure if this is local flavor or a way of making shellfish last longer. I have eaten oysters from Seattle to Chesapeake to France, and these came nowhere close. Next time I will try the fish stand that will shuck oysters for £2 each.||September 3, 2012
woozal27||50||Such a great find! A delicious array of goods with a cheery atmosphere. Plan your visit when you have empty tummies! ||September 1, 2012
James H||50||My sons college have set up a trip to this market as we were in town we went to check it out.When it comes to food and drink Borough Market a really short stroll from London bridge has it all.I hate supermarkets so much the missus leaves me at home I tend to wander off lost wanting to return to the car with the few things that are of interest.But Borough Market is full of goodies almost every stall weather you want to eat it or take food home to cook later fresh meat,fish,veg,cakes and bread and many other delights.Next time you are in London take a look for yourself you will never want to go back to those boring supermarkets shelves again.||September 1, 2012
LadySicily||50||You'll forget you are in London! No matter how bad the weather can be, Borough Market has got the right vibe no matter what. Fantastic gourmet specialities from all over the place, the locally sourced products from Uk are really , truly genuine and good,each stand has people working behind it that are truly passionate about what the do and that really makes a huge difference! Tehre is always something new to discover, and tastings everywhere. We love the New Forest Organic Cider stand, and the Scallops stand right in front of it. Superb! Not to mention that the have the best Oysters I have ever had , and altough a little messy it's an experience! Go go go, it's really a unique London gourmet market!||August 31, 2012
BrendaA138||50||Borough Market is a must see when traveling to London! It is an outdoor market that offers a wide range of high quality food to purchase and taste - everything from wine to beer to organic veggies to paella. Borough Market is also a great place to just wonder around and people watch. Easy to get to from the London Bridge Tube stop. The market is open all day, but closes around 5 so definitely go hungry for lunch. There are quite a few pubs and restaurants surrounding the market so if you feel you would like more of a "sit down" meal, there are options.||August 31, 2012
Beatrice-TA||50||By far this is one of my favourite places in this area of London. I usually go first thing on a Saturday mainly to beat the crowds. The food on the stalls is fantastic and the smells hit you round every corner.If you want fresh food this is it at it's best. Somethings may be pricey but you get what you pay for and a lot of food here isn't readily available in other places. The alcohol stalls sell drinks made locally and specialist stuff. I go to a stall called The Spice Mountain it sells a wide variety of spices, chillies and the like.There are also some restaurants in the market but they are expensive. Why not try the many cafes scattered amongst the little streets.I wouldn't recommend going if you are hungry, there really is too much temptation.||August 31, 2012
Nell10_10||50||I was brought here by a friend without really knowing what it was like. But it was fantastic! Loads of choice and actually quite interesting just to wander about. However, do eat there too! The food's great.||August 30, 2012
middlefarne||50||There are lots of food markets in London these days, but Borough remains the best in my opinion. It gets horrendously crowded, and you can spend a king's ransom, but the food is invariably excellent. You can buy high quality raw vegetables, bread, meat and fish, cakes and chocolates, and great street food. In the roads around the market are excellent specialist shops, too, like Neal's Yard Dairy for cheese.||August 30, 2012
Talmont||30||Ate delicious street food including yummy pasta. Had lots of samples from the various stalls there including some delicious olive oils. But the amount of fresh fruit and veg on display and sale was very disappointing.||August 28, 2012
SandyIsleofWight||50||Visit Borough market on an empty stomach - there is so much to tempt you and a wealth of food to try out. Wash down breakfast/lunch with a Prosecco spritzer or Pimms or choose from a huge variety of wines and beers. The market is located near London Bridge station and is usually closed on Sundays but open every day during the olympic period,||August 27, 2012
discerningdick||30||yeah all good fun got some nice cheeses and sausages, tasted some nice things but the attempt to charge me £3 (priced £0.98 per Kg.) for 1 beef tomato at the store with the big display of tomatoes left me stunned! i don't remember having 'mug' stamped on my forehead. Tourists beware||August 25, 2012
England_EssexDenise||40||Great place to go and sample before you buy. Cheese, spicy salsa, sauces, fig cake, liquorice and much more, t unusual veggies and lots of stalls selling street food. a good choice of restaurants, Wrights selling oysters and champagne, delicious. Then take a walk along the Thames, visit the Globe theatre, take in a play, or just sit at one of the many bars along the walk way and take it all in.||August 20, 2012
zakattack19||50||Borough Market after a walk along the Thames crossing from St.Paul's, coffee at the Tate Modern, walk past the Globe and along to Borough Market to browse and then have lunch. Recommended - tasting all samples on offer - widens your experience of food quickly and good if you have children or grumpy teenagers in tow. We loved Japanese chicken dumplings and lamb burritos. Portuguese custard tarts also excellent. Afterwards, have a look around Southwark Cathedral. (a few value for money museums nearby too - Operating Theatre very interesting).||August 20, 2012
Jasheppa||50||If you love fresh food, don't miss this spot. Handmade cheeses, fresh fruits and veggies, pastries and all manner of prepared international foods. Get what interests you, a glass of proseco and have a picnic at one of the tables at the market or in the courtyard of the church next door. Don't miss!||August 18, 2012
Phil W||50||My partners birthday treat was a trip into London first stop Borough Market where you can walk around loads of stalls selling all different food from all over Europe, Cheese's, Meats, Fish, Veg, Sauces,Wines ect. The good thing is many of the stalls let you try before you buy and you can also get food to eat straight away while you stroll around with all the marvelous aroma's under your nose. Well the best bit was finding Maria's Market Cafe. I remember seeing this on TV chefs Rick Stein's show he had a Bubble & Squeak Cheese & Bacon Bap so I gave it a go Fantastic taste, My partner Juli went for a Rump Steak Rocket & Onion Bap and was suitably impressed. If your in London near London Bridge pop down to Borough Market and have a tasty treat. Its open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.||August 17, 2012
Stephanie M||40||Borough market was a lot of fun. Lots of different cheeses, hams, jams and much more. You can try most things, and I recommend that you do. It s great tasting all the different things. We spent the morning there and afterwards went for a walk by the thames. If you love food, give this market a visit!||August 17, 2012
massiek||40||My son and I were staying at a nearby Premier Inn for the Olympics this summer. Spent 7 days in this area. Had four meals at the market and every meal was delicious and special.However, my son became ill after eating his kangaroo burger, even though I didn't get sick. I have to assume they didn't cook his burger properly.||August 16, 2012
barkman||50||This place should be a must do for anyone travelling to London. Make sure to go with an open mind and an empty stomach and you'll have some great food to try.||August 12, 2012
gfsu||50||A great place to snack and get some unique food. The grilled cheese at Kappacasein is not to be missed, grab a uber brownie or any other fresh item and you will be pleased. Easy two minute wal from tower bridge tube||August 12, 2012
Sofia G||40||One of the most exciting markets in London. Don't miss the various cheeses, the jars with the French Cassoulet and of course, the toast with melted Raclette! A great idea for a Saturday day out!||August 9, 2012
Damian35||50||My family and I lived in London for 3.5 years and discovered Borough Markets well into our 2nd year.....but wish we had found it earlier. Make sure you get there as early as you can as it get crazy busy mid morning onwards. The food, sights and smells are amazing.....you get to taste the flavours of the UK and Europe all in one amazing location. I can't remember the name of the wine bar near the main entry but it's a great place to go for a lunch time drink after a morning wondering the markets !||August 8, 2012
auscarrick47||50||I was brought up in this area and it is great to see develop into a great tourist attraction, if you are only going to one market in your life this is the one it has a great atmosphere it is great for shopping, eating and mingling with people, when you have finished make your way down to The Anchor pub on the Bankside for a relaxing drink you are then a short walking distance The Globe Theatre.I now live in Australia but always go to the Borough Market when in London, enjoy the experience.||August 8, 2012
sleepyrambler||50||First time to the Market... Excellent food stalls, love the cockney traders! Go towards the end of you day so you don't have to carry all your goodies around with you!||August 8, 2012
DondiJoseph||50||There is a great buzz in Borough Market and more than that, a fabulous variety of food! You could spend a lifetime there, glass of prosecco in hand, walking from stall to stall for the pleasure of eating and people watching. If you like food, this is a must do destination!||August 7, 2012
ChezzaSue||40||The best thing about Borough Market (apart form it being close to where I live and that it is currentl open on Sundays), is that you can have anything you want here. And even if you don't want it, you may end up with it. Despite the packs of people there on a Saturday, you're in for a treat and bound to have your taste buds dazzled. My highlight is the roast chicken wrap and the rouclette. A helpful hint though, if you are going to go, go hungry, or go with a hungry fruend so you can share and taste more!||August 7, 2012
Kristen K||50||My favorite London experience- from the generous free samples to the great photo opportunities to the varied crowd. Check out the Market Porter for their gorgeous flowers and notice the Globe Pub where scenes from Bridget Jones' Diary were filmed. Join the long queue at Monmouth Coffee Company (and if you are lucky enough for the Brindisa chorizo sandwich). If you visit in fall or winter, stroll with a mug of hot cider or mulled wine. The little stall outside of Southwark Cathedral makes the best grilled cheese sandwich you will ever taste. I will only share half of my sandwich if I am also going to share the fish and chips from Fish Kitchen.||August 6, 2012
hawkyh73||40||Great buzz and generous with the samples. Clean and felt comfy eating from stalls. Something for everyone, good way to spend an hour or two. You may have to queue for some of the lunch places but I reckon you will thing it is worth it.||August 4, 2012
Jeffdee||50||There is a great atmosphere in this market and in the surrounding streets. If you love good quality artisan food then this is the place for you! There is a large selection of veg, meat, bread and cheese as well as alcoholic drinks! It's a nice place to grab a cider and people watch!||August 4, 2012
Hmandel21||50||I've been in London for about a week and typically, the food has been awful in london.I had one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life in Borough Market. Not sure what the place is called but they have a pork belly sandwich with apple sauce that is simply perfect. The curry in the area is very good as well and they have a duck sandwich that tasted great. Try the pork belly! Insane ||August 4, 2012
rachibelle||50||We stumbled upon this following an early morning walk, and what a delight!Its like a film set, underneath a train track, and full of all kinds of food. The smells are rich and diverse. It was magical being transported to this bustling market, full of different sights, sounds and smells. Its worth a visit!||August 1, 2012
edna_aquino||50||A visit to London is never complete without dropping by its numerous bustling markets. Our first stop: the iconic Borough Market at the foot of London Bridge. A testimony to London's diversity; its being a capital of world culture and a celebration of home industries still being truly alive albeit surviving the invasion by giant supermarket chains.Truly a feast to all senses. Shopowners are very generous in serving you their tasters - which could fill up your stomach by the time you finish your round. The wholesale market operates on all weekday mornings from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m but the retail market operates only on Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Fridays from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The market, which has focused historically on fruits and vegetables, has in recent years added stalls dealing with the fine food retail market. Borough Market has become a fashionable place to buy food. It has been promoted by British television chefs and has been used as a film set. The Borough Market is also a good starting point for a walk long the embankment from the London Bridget till the South Bank - with lot of historical and touristic attractions along the way - including the Clink Street, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, the Tate Modern and the South Bank.||July 31, 2012
Diner4two||50||Having had a lovely brunch at the Swan at the Globe, with the added attraction of the London Olympic Flame going past the window on the Royal Barge Gloriana (ok maybe you won't get that, but it's the South bank so you never know what might be going on!) We strolled around the corner by the replica of the Golden Hinde to Borough Market. What a gem! We arrived at lunchtime so the market was packed with Business types mixing with tourists and just plain local shoppers.The first sight was the crowd of people spilling out of "the Market Porter" pub and thronging into the road. No novelty stalls here, it's about food and drink. When we arrived there were queues of people buying their lunches fish and chips, veggie specialities, great paella dishes bubbling away, a variety of hot and cold cooked meats from quite spectacular burgers, up to and including Ostreich and Camel! We decided not to queue up but let the lunchtime crowds die down a little and walk around first and view the various markets and stalls before choosing. Lets face it you do not want to carry produce around if you do not have to. However you have to be a little careful if these are fresh goods that they can sell out.when it came to eating my wife had a veggie option, not my cup of tea but that she must have liked as she kept say to me try this! Did I mention the stalls selling loose teas? I had 4 large oysters which he pulled from a large insulated box and opened for me. All i added was a little chilli sauce and some lemon juice. I was surprised as they turned out to be both the biggest and the best oysters I have ever tasted!!! All this was washed down with some Real Cider from the New Forest Cider company. We move just a few feet outside and sat on the benches in the courtyard of Southwark Cathedral in the sun to enjoy them and agree what stalls we would return to for our produce which was Bread, Chutney, Cheese and Wine. Not to say the meats and wet fish, mushrooms and vegetables, Beers didn't look tempting. The cheese came from the fantastic selection at the wonderful cheese shop Neal's Yard at the market entrance, worth a trip on it's own. With whole cheeses up to the roof and at least a dozen staff serving. Glad we took a back pack containing a couple of cool bags with those ice block things to be sure we would ge them home on the train in top condition.Oh we bought a hessian bag with Borough Market on to satisfy your Tourist tendancies! The sights (lots of people taking photographs) the smells and the sounds, (including the trains going overhead make this a delight to visit. We will probably do the same again as part of a trip to London rather than a single purpose trip but we will return without a doubt. If not before definately to for some Christmas food.||July 30, 2012
collegecounselor||50||This gourmet food market is on the South side of the Thames, near beautiful Southwark Cathedral. If you have time, walk along the river from the London Eye all the way down to Borough, then buy lunch at the market (so many great choices!) then tour the cathedral or stop at a historic pub. I would consider staying in Southwark or near the Tower, just to have closer access to Borough Market! It's fantastic!||July 29, 2012
ruinme||50||I've been to Borough Market on more than one occasion and both times I have been overwhelmed and excited at the food you can get there. From fresh raw ingredients to hot food stands and other pieces to take home it's a food lover's dream. I have eaten some of the great food there and gone away with other tasty things for home.There are just two things that are negative points and that is just how busy it can get, on Saturday it can be ridiculously crowded and busy that it's almost hard to walk around and see anything. I found going on a Friday seems to be much better. The second one is the price, for someone not living in London I found prices of the items to be pushing towards the pricey end of the scale, however there are some reasonably priced bits thrown into the mix.I would definitely revisit many times over, especially if I lived in London.||July 28, 2012
backdrifters||50||Visited on a Saturday morning. Great place to taste/buy a wide variety of fresh fruit/vegetables, meats, cheeses, conserves, etc. Also a few decent dine-in options in and around the market. Southwark Cathedral is also worth a swing by.||July 27, 2012
Mark H||50||If you like food & drink and you love a lively atmosphere then you must head to the food Mecca that is Borough Market. Situated 1 minute south of Southwark Cathedral and a couple of minutes easy walk from London Bridge tube it is a must see.The best of food and drink from all around the UK all under one roof. The range of foods available is simply staggering, everything from artisan cheese makers, organic meat producers, wine makers, seafood sellers to exotic spice vendors and cake makers.A great place to spend a morning wandering stall to stall, filling your shopping basket and stomach.||July 27, 2012
lita54||50||Absolutely worth visiting, but make sure you are hungry enough before going there, cause it's a lot of nice food that needs to be tasted. Nam, nam :)||July 26, 2012
Beadsbb||40||A foodie market, this is THE place to pick up fresh and exotic produce. They sell everything (with a price) from Portugese Marmalades, dipping oils, spices, mushrooms, fish and Ostrich burgers! There are many free samples of food to be had whist squeezing through the crowds. It does get really busy, so I would recommend getting there as early as possible (opening hours vary depending on which day you visit). There are many places that serve fresh food to takeaway, there is one establishment in which you can dine in called 'Roast'. Personally I would opt for a takeaway as they sell food to cater for ever single taste or prefrence, such as Kosher, Halal, Veggie, Vegan or meat eaters! The takeaways cost an average of £4.50, but is so worth it! Opening Days/ TimesMonday-Wednesday (Lunch) 10am-3pmThursdays - 11am-5pmFridays - 12pm-6pmSaturdays - 8am-5pm||July 26, 2012
museblogger||50||A feast for the senses. A ton of fabulous fresh food stalls that will delight the eye and the taste buds. We bought a pound of cherries to take with us for a later snack, and they were delicious. You can get fresh veggies and fruit or cooked foods for a stand up or take out meal. ||July 24, 2012
CSB2004||50||My wife and I love this market, she is lactose intolerant and got some goats milk ice cream she was ecstatic that she got to eat ice cream for the first time in years. We also try Turkish delight for the first time ever here and it was wonderful. This is a must see, we highly recommend.||July 23, 2012
DaninAtlanta||50||This is worth a trip to anyone visiting London. We went for lunch on the last day of our visit, and will definitely go back the next time in London. We sampled a variety of foods and bought some truffle oil to bring home. ||July 22, 2012
GundaJohannesburg||50||Meat, veggies, fruit, bread, cheese, juice, spices, condiments, whatever your heart desires, you find it here.I agree with Tobersy, all your favorite foods are here and then some you have not tried before, the temptation just goes on and on and it's all delicious.THE place to go shopping on a weekly basis.By the way, Borough Market is open for lunch on Mondays through Wednesdays.||July 22, 2012
Caro397||50||Make sure you go hungry as there is so much to try, and all of it great food. I went both on a Thursday and a Saturday and wouldn't go on a Saturday again as the crowds were too much. ||July 22, 2012
iLLyCoffeeFan||40||We ate in Bedales which was a mistake. Not child friendly. Its maybe ok if you're going for the wine. We had our best food when we bought cookies, fruit juice, liquorice, brownies, cheescake from the stalls AFTER Bedales visit||July 20, 2012
Tobersy||50||I've been to London many times and have seen most of the touristy sites. However, my absolute all time favorite place is, hands down, Borough Market. They are open Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays and you have to go early (and hungry). Here is my strategy for touring the market: 1) buy the first thing you see to eat and start eating, 2) roam around the stalls while eating, 3) as soon as you've finished eating, buy the food at whatever stall you're standing in front of and start eating, 4) repeat until no longer physically possible. You won't be sorry.||July 19, 2012
Mike_Alcazaren||50||I am so glad that I missed out on lunch right before I came here! My girlfriend and I were able to sample so many delicious things, candies, fruits, cheeses, sausages and ending with Salt Beef Sandwiches. There is enough coverings over most of the market to keep you dry. Try the smoothies from the "Total Organic Juice Bar" - I got a delicious mint (and something else that I forgot).||July 18, 2012
dsmetcalfe||50||Firstly, this is not an East End type street market but a real foodie place specialising in the organic, high-end type of stuff, with prices and juuuust occasionally a bit of pretension to match. Having said that, the food quality here is fantastic, with small producers that you just won't find anywhere else and some very knowledgeable people behind the stalls. Half the fun is just wandering around sampling things, great coffee from Monmouth, cheeses from Neals Yard, etc. The meats and fish are amongst the best I've bought in London, and the market site is an attraction in itself with its old arches under the train tracks; in fact there's been a market here since Roman times. Go early to beat the Boden-clad crowds, wander about, talk to the traders, sample stuff, breakfast on a hot dog or hot chorizo sandwich or splash out at Roast. Or go later and grab a pint at the Market Porter. A tip for tourists: the Market makes a great start to a Saturday and is just off the South Bank walk that takes in a landmark or three. ||July 18, 2012
savvybostonian||50||Having visited Portobello Market earlier in the year, I decided to spice things up this trip with a stop at the much buzzed about Borough Market. Located just off the London Bridge tube station, the market is open Thursday-Saturday and boasts a wide variety of food and drink stalls. To put it bluntly, it’s a foodie heaven. I didn’t know where to start, but after a proper wander around, I felt right at home. From massive curries, to colorful juices, and alcoholic beverages, it’s hard not to leave Borough Market stuffed to the gills.Tip: While by Borough Market, don’t forget to stop by Southwark Cathedral, the oldest Gothic church in London and walk a good five blocks to snap the requisite photo of yourself by Tower Bridge (not to be confused with the less exciting London Bridge).||July 18, 2012
RaistlinMajer||40||It is a good market for "foodies". you can see and smell many things here and enjoy an hour or two.The arrangements of the stalls may be confusing but it is part of the fun ||July 17, 2012
Marian S||50||This was our first time in London and we were absolutely delighted by the Borough Market! The array of food, the sights, aromas, and colors were beautiful! My daughter, a budding photographer, took some amazing photos of the food. Arrive here HUNGRY!! This was one of the highlights of our trip!||July 16, 2012
UESgal||50||London is not always blessed with good weather but make sure you find one day for walking around the Borough Market (check the website for days and hours open) - huge open market with lots to see, smell, eat, drink. On the Saturday my friends and I went it was packed with locals and tourists alike, lines were long to get what you want so be patient! The chorizo burgers are fantastic, the pies are great, lots of cheese. wine, dessert - everything you can ask for they have it there. Wind down with coffee at Monmouth. Tip: sit by the old chapel nearby, there are benches (and grassy areas) and when the sun's out it's just nice to hang around, drink wine, chat.||July 15, 2012
Jbrat26||50||This was one of the highlights of our trip. We had planned to go here for lunch before a show at the globe and ended up arriving here early. We were so glad we did, it was wonderful. The best food in London...sandwiches, chocolates, nuts, fruits, veggies, jams, alchohol, fish...simply amazing! The smell walking in was heavenly. It's hard to pick only a few things, I circled around twice before finally deciding. I wish I had someplace like this back home. I would allow for at least 2hrs to wander around and soak up the environment. Be sure to check their hours of operation as they are not open every day.||July 15, 2012
canard314||50||The owner of the B&B we were staying at highly recommended going to Borough Market (on Saturday). I'm so glad we did! I could have spent a fortune on all the wonderful smelling food and decadent treats! I wish we had something like this in St. Louis. We went in the morning to just to walk around, did some sightseeing and then came back for lunch. Don't miss this!||July 13, 2012
PaulineHawk||50||If you're in Borough, you simply must visit the Borough Market. It's a hive of activity and sells a wide variety of the freshest food. We were staying a couple of streets away from the market and so an easy walk and also an easy walk from Borough Station and Elephant and Castle station. You can choose all sorts of specialty foods from the market. Cheese, bread, meat, vegetables and fruit, seafood, sweet treats to name a few. I was delighted to find some Truffle Oil and it was delicious in a salad. I was also impressed with a small coffee shop across from the market as its coffee is the best around. There was a large wooden table in the centre of the cafe with breads and jams on the table. You can drink your coffee with bread and jam. Wonderful. But you had better get in quick, this cafe is very popular and unfortunately I never got a seat. Instead I drank my coffee standing up. It was worth it.||July 12, 2012
brewerpride06||50||Excellent vibe around the Borough Market during our time there. There is so much food to pick from you will have to "sacrafice" by only getting what you have time for. I am fairly certain I ate some of the best food I have ever had and greatly appreciated the excellent variety offered to me. Take a few hours and enjoy the area and experience all that London has to offer.||July 11, 2012
Janet R||40||This place was as busy as a beehive when we were there on a Saturday lunchtime. There is a great atmosphere and the most glorious eclectic displays of food.If you are a hygiene junkie its not for you as this could leave a lot to be desired. The bathroom facilities looked very basic and there were long queues. This wasn't a problem for us as we ate at the Brewhouse which seemed to have an aura of calm within a hive of activity.||July 9, 2012
Susan2009||50||Our very first time at Borough Market on a Friday afternoon. The selection of fresh fruit and veggies was beyond compare. Excellent beverages and sweets, too. Nearby Neal's Yard for cheese -- yum!||July 9, 2012
ANP123||50||My favorite place to go when I am in London. An absolute Foodies dream and well wortht he time to go and wander through, buy little munchies and drool atthe wonderful food||July 9, 2012
LeeBKHerts||50||This place is buzzing and very exciting. The choice of foods is glorious to see and buy. We go regularly and eat something different every time from one of the stalls and are never disappointed. Some of the cheeses are amazing, there is everything you can think of in abundance, it's one of our favourite places in London. We always go home with different produce to try. You can take a very short walk past the golden hind which is moored closely, and the Clink, worth a look, along bankside and over the bridge. Alternatively you can get a short boat ride to Greenwich or St Catherines dock then take a short stroll to the tower of London. It's a good starting point for a fabulous day out.||July 7, 2012
HastingsSteve||40||Not only does the Borough Market have a varied selection of stalls to visit, but is wonderfully supplied with a variety of foods to keep you goong too, and 2 excellent bars, the Market Porter pub and The Rake, which also sell good food as well as excellent ales and European and craft beers in bottles. All of this beneath the historic Southwark Cathedral, which has been a cathedral for a hundred years, parish church before that, but the site has been inhabited by religious establishments since the 9th century! Catch a train or bus to the south side of London Bridge and a must visit.||July 7, 2012
mickygees||50||The market is a fantastic mix of sights, sounds and especially smells. However be careful as you will go intending not to but anything but will find yourself trying samples of cheese and ham and other products that are impossible to resist. Its probably not cheap but the quality of produce is fantastic. If you just fancy a social occasion there are great restaurants and if you just want a beer a really great bar in the corner of the market selling beers from all over the world, Belgian beer being my favourite. I took my parents here and it was their most enjoyable day in London, so what are waiting for, enjoy.||July 7, 2012
HumanFactors||40||I often pass this under cover market.Being a foodie I can't just walk past.It is a bustling market, with excellent food stalls with game, poultry and meat to fresh vegetables and lots of great stalls to pick up a snack.If you plan to visit, do check opening times for specific days of the week.If it were closer to where I lived, I'd readily shop here every day!||July 6, 2012
Chris S||50||Excellent place for top quality foods particularly meats and cheese which come from all over the place and are fresh and top notch. Nice pub in the market and also the lunchtime market food is great too. Give it a try its been around for over a thousand years in one shape or form.||July 6, 2012
foxesforever||50||Saturday morning 0900 is the best time. Grab a great breakfast at Brindisi or in the market cafe then shop for excellent quality produce and drinks. Northfield Farm for the best meat (marginally - they are all good) and when you,ve done look in Southwark Cathedral.||July 6, 2012
judal||50||My husband, daughter and I spent a lovely time here last Saturday lunchtime and ate some lovely produce. My daughter and I had a wonderful roll with the best pork I have ever tasted from a place called Roast. It was really tender and sweet with a gorgeous thin salty crackling. (So not too hard on the old teeth!) My husband was a bit disappointed with his meal which was mash and gherkins with melted cheese over the top. We bought some lovely brownies and those really fresh green olives which didn't last very long! We also bought some cheese which WAS very tasty but I thought it was quite expensive. I would definitely return regularly when we are in London. It is a very interesting part of the capital and actually I think it is my favourite now. Right on the Thames and near The Globe Theatre. Very Jack the Ripper-ish atmosphere in places!||July 6, 2012
BugariLux||50||if you are visiting London or if you live there, it is great place to go.All kinds of different foods from all around the world. The colours, the smell , variety and atmosphere makes this place a must see.||July 6, 2012
RuswarpBoy||20||An overcrowded,overpriced rambling mess.By all means put it on the list of sightseeing targets in the area with the Shard, the Globe, Vinopolis etc. but it is certainly nothing special. Strictly a pseuds paradise!||July 6, 2012
parchick||40||We live just outside of London and love to visit the Borough Market every so often. We like to go hungry so we can buy several different foods to share. We have learned to go mid afternoon so the crowds have thinned and it is much easier to get around.||July 6, 2012
Ruchika K||40||The moment you enter the market you feel you are in a farmer’s market situated in countryside. The people, the food, and the smells everything seems very authentic and fresh. The best way to enjoy the market is to go on a Saturday morning empty stomach and the moment you enter everything you like start trying small portions of it. Trust me when you finish the trip you will be so full and satisfied and will realise how many different things you have tried. I highly recommend the baker’s section of the market.||July 3, 2012
AlexSwallow||50||Absolutely love everything about this market. Amazing producers, interesting independent shops nearby, absolutely delicious food and a great area with the Tate Modern, the Globe, Southwark Cathedral, the Cutty Sark, Vinopolis, City Hall, Tower Bridge etc only a short walk away.||July 2, 2012
Jessie j||50||had a great morning at the market, defiantly worth a look around, not alot to do there though, expect to spend alot! plenty of free samples to try too though ||July 2, 2012
cheungtai||50||Every visit to London has to include this hidden gem. It's a must for any foodie as you are bombarded with an assortment of cheeses, italian, spanish hams, preserves and really anything you care to eat. OK the prices can be a little steep, but boy is the quality worth it. Do not miss Sillfield farm - great wild boar - and the prawn and cajun fish wraps served by the stall by the fish restaurant at the bottom road are not to be missed.||July 2, 2012
MarcOMaoldomhnaigh||40||I went with my partner for a stroll around the market, as my partner wanted to visit while she was in London. Lovely feel to the market, and the different smells of food makes you nice and hungry. We decided to eat on our feet, and stopped at Baxters stall for some food. I got the Wild Boar sausage, and my partner the beefburger, which we enjoyed immensely.....Plenty of choices for food, to eat at the market, or to buy to cook at home. Nice for a stop off on a Saturday morning before going to sights around London bridge......||July 2, 2012
Erik H||50||Arrived just as it opened and had a great time exploring all the different food stalls. Only wish I could eat four times as much, can't remember the last time i saw so much nice food and met so many nice people. These people are really proud of their products and enjoy talking about them. ||July 1, 2012
MoeLoveheart||50||We came across this wonderful food market by accident. The range and quality of fresh food is amazing. The three of us all chose to purchase lunch from different stalls and we were not disappointed. Don't go by the pie stall or the stall selling little spanish pasties without trying some.||July 1, 2012
Karla M||40||I stumbled on this market when I was wondering around looking for somewhere to eat. A really lively market, they offered plenty of free samples of amazing food...I've been told you can eat what amounts to an entire meal there basically for free. They had a lot of good food for take away, for relatively cheap (by London standards). Highly recommend a visit, especially if you're staying in the area.||July 1, 2012
julietb232||50||7days a week is a little mind-blowing. This market is amazing and pretty much always crowded. Visiting at around 10-11 in the mornings gives the best chance of a comfortable browse. There is something here for everyone . Prices are higher than you might expect for a 'market' but this has become destination shopping for anyone searching out the intriguing or special in the world of food and drink . Normally Thurs, Fri, Sat are market days. It will be really interesting to see how 7 day trading alters the feel and buzz of this unique part of London||June 30, 2012
GazLondon||50||I love this market. The atmosphere especially on a Saturday is wonderful. There is a vast array of food on offer either to take home or eat there. Huge number of excellent stall with superb quality artisan and organic products sold directly from their proud producers. Relax and wander around, sampling outstanding food and drinks too, and get inspired to take home and cook some different and new dishes with what you have bought. Highly recommended.||June 30, 2012
CentralSquareSweetie||50||A must see!! And do go hungry. Be prepared to wander through stall after stall of exotic and fresh foods. It's crowded, but worth it. It's a festive atmosphere, with people walking around with glasses of Proseco and Sangria and pints of beer. As a photographer I found it to be a visual treasure trove. Also, it's a nice place to pick up inexpensive souveneirs for the folks back home (dish towels, jars of jam, etc.)||June 28, 2012
okcu2000||50||This is a perfect place to have some nice food. Pls mind that it is near london bridge.Almost always very crovded marketplace so not convenient for small child and handicaped.||June 28, 2012
mathlawguy||50||Went many times. Best food spots: the coffee guy; the ice cream vendor; the goat ice cream vendor. Mediocre: the paella place near the tube station.||June 27, 2012
ChrisB60||50||Borough Market is the Harrods of markets. A must to visit just for the experience being something different! ||June 22, 2012
Vanessa B||40||Was staying nearby and wanted to grab a quick lunch.Settled on the empanadas which were delicious and some egg tartts, which were the best I had eaten.Yes, it is probably more touristy than other markets but the variety of food available was amazing and definitely worth a look around if you are in the area.||June 19, 2012
Sregdab28||50||Had an amazing time here, you can peruse the food stalls for hours looking at home made jams, preserves, chutneys. Every type of food is sold here, you even find whole lambs hanging up at the butchers. Got a really interesting medieval feel to some parts of the market||June 17, 2012
Obi2Kenobi||40||First started going some fifteen years ago... when things were a little quieter. Fantastic, varied produce which is admittedly expensive if you aim at the top end but also some great bargains to be had if you look more closely at the "lesser" cuts of meat, fish and veg. Always a busy place, it seems to suffer a little from its popularity due to overcrowding. I can only hope that this will be addressed when all the refurbishment work is finished, it looks as if it will be quite stunning.Many of the stall holders are up for a bit of a chat and happily give samples of their produce. Also some great options for a bite to eat on the hop.My Favorites: the ginger pig (meat), Shellseekers (fish and seafood), Neals yard (Cheese, Dairy and Bread), Turnips(Fruit and veg), The guy with the basque Jesus and chorizo, Monts (Cheese)||June 17, 2012
jennerm||50||I've been to markets in the US, Paris, Madrid, etc.. This is by far the best of them all. Loads of people and amazing food. Bring cash, you'll need it for the artisan chocolates, cheeses, fig bars, produce, paella, and EVEN jamon serrano. WOW. Great stuff and great people watching. Go on a Saturday morning as it is really the only time to get the whole experience. Will definitely return, and bring more cash!||June 16, 2012
yvonne_kou||50||Borough market is a great place to spend for one hoyr or two,epecially if its raining.The Market is open every Friday and Saturday.There you can buy cheese,fish,olives etc.or you can eat something!It has fish and chips,paella,sausages etc.||June 15, 2012
alexander_uk_1985||50||i love to visit this buzzing market on a saturday morning, toget together my bits and pieces and eat some nice seafood,or sausage-sarnie.one of my favorite shops is turnips, where you get a hugevariety of vegetables - and top quality mushrooms of all kind.also don't miss the chocolate shop "the rabot estate" for some hot-coco with chili kick.||June 14, 2012
Katesr||50||Lots of fun. Bars and shops throughout. Terrific people watching. Food samples. High energy||June 12, 2012
Crewze||50||This ancient market is still a going concern. It has lots of great food to eat there or to buy and take home. Bought one of the tastiest organic chickens I have ever had. I love the Chorizo Sausage on a bun they sell at the entrance to the market. Also check out Neal's Yard Dairy for some excellent cheese and have a pint at The Market Porter.||June 11, 2012
Feeding_the_World||40||If you only go for the Toasted Cheese Sandwiches and the people-gazing this market will be a success. Don't take it too seriously. Prices are steep, but many of the products are artisan-level quality. We met up with some friends, ate a little bit, then went to a champagne bar. It was a great day.* TIP: If you are looking for a more funky, hippie-dippy, colorful and exotic market, check out the Camden Market.||June 10, 2012
saqawm||30||I was expecting it to be bigger with lots more variety food wise but it was still good. Free tasting samples here and there.||June 8, 2012
nichnaimhsi||50||We had a couple of hours to spare on our last day in London before our flight. Borough Market was a great way to pass the time. A yummy time was had exploring and sampling our way through all the stalls. Would strongly recommend a visit!||June 8, 2012
gillian p||50||If you like food, you will be in food heaven. This is bridget jones country that exudes atmosphere. This market is next to southwark cathedral, and close to the embankment, theres something for everyone in this area. Quality fresh foods sold. You feel so special walking around learning about new ingrediants, chatting too stall holders, and tasting their produce.||June 7, 2012
bronz1inthekeys||40||This market is fabulous! Go HUNGRY!! Stayed just around the corner & became completely spoiled. They sell every kind of food under the sun. The olives are to die for! Fresh produce is stellar and if you're a lover of sea foods, this is the place for you. Giant North Sea prawns,urchins,crab similar to Fl stone crabs,oysters and tons of fish..what a selection. Juices, jellies, jams, meats, cheeses, nuts,herbs, sweets...all amazing. The take away foods are wonderful! FISH,(it's name) take out fish & chips. Choose your type of fish, huge portions of golden, perfectly fried fish UNDER 10 pounds! My favorite, Hobbs Meats!! :) Lots of roast meat sandwiches! The rolls are delicious pick your flavor (meat) and dress it. Faves, the salt beef (corned beef to you Americans) and the pork w/stuffing & apple!!!!! I grab one for the plane, infinitely better then the airlines options.Generally rent a flat when I'm here & this is where I go to stock my fridge.If you go early & I mean early, you'll see several of London's top chefs doing their shopping! I can't go to London without stopping here!||June 7, 2012
bjos||50||Huge selection of gourmet Ingredients, free samples, and also prepared food. Thers even a guy who sells truffle infused trees so you can grow your own truffles! Dont miss the otsters, the delicious organic burgers or the duck sandwich! Highly recomended!||June 2, 2012
captainu||10||OK for a look around, but everything is overpriced.. There's a lot better markets/shops around London.||June 2, 2012
lovetogoalways||50||This is an amazing market filled with fabulous foods to eat there and tak away. Really important to get there early because it tends to get so crowded that hard to really shop for anything.||June 1, 2012
smilingtravelbug||50||Come with a massive shopping bag and a wallet filled with cash. So many great things to salivate over. So much noise, hustle, bustle and quality produce. Make a day of it.||May 30, 2012
evelyncher||40||As a first timer, I found it to be just great... lots of food/bev tasting... place is live and with great food choices ...||May 30, 2012
DPB123||50||Visiting the BM was one of the first things we did after arriving in London. If I lived in London, I would go every week to stock up on fresh produce and fish, plus some primo cheese and other goodies. I saw cuts of beef and lamb that I had never seen not heard of before. The slabs of cheese from all over Europe were fun to sample and buy. Lots of variety in every category. If you were in London and planning a dinner party, this is where you could pick-up all of the premium ingredients. The street food options combine with the more established stalls and stores to create a spralling and wonderful foodie experience tucked away in a mazelike setting that is hard to describe. I had some Caribbean fish Curry to begin with and ended with a duck confit sandwich that I will never forget. Pies, ham slices, cheeses, sausages and some ales were squeezed in along the way. The selection of Italian cheeses and hams was spectacular and the prices were a decent value, even for pricey London. Lots of friendly shop keepers and food "pushers" made the experience even better. If you are into food, this is a "must do" in London.||May 28, 2012
under25||50||If you like to eat this is the place--possibly one of the best farmers markets in the world. It is open to the public Thursday, Friday and Saturday and is a London must-see. It helped inspire, among other things, Diagon Alley in the Harry Potter series. The food displays are outstanding, more types of produce than I have seen anywhere along with stalls for cheese, sausage, breads, chocolates, you-name-it. If you visit be sure to try the mulled wine and duck comfit sandwich before you leave. The chocolate truffles near the entrance were also delicious.||May 28, 2012
PyynikinParoni||50||Just superb place!! I really want to go back asap. Loads of variety, fresh / organic ingredients and a great buzz. We had such a hard time on choosing what to eat and had to take breaks just to able to try still one more thing. Love it, big time!Will absolutely go back the next time in London! Might even go just for the market...||May 27, 2012
moreburger||40||I suggest sampling everything before choosing your meal you'd be surprised what you'll end up with.||May 26, 2012
Alan P||50||We love Borough Market probably one of the best farmers market in the world... produce is outstanding, range is immense but strangely it has a small but very intense feel to it...||May 25, 2012
ElizabethM888||50||The food and drink variety is unreal! Even if you don't like all the foods it is fun to stroll through!||May 25, 2012
ChrisH73||50||I went on a Saturday. After some time the market started to get packed with people. There is a great variety of food on offer. I really had difficulties on trying things. Obviously you can't have everything. So I went for a kangoroo burger and some goat milk ice cream. So, going once to that market will not be enough.Make sure you come at the weekend, because at the beginning of the week the market is not open.||May 24, 2012
xbxbxb||40||It's really a good market with decent prices and a lot of very fresh food. But trying out those fresh oysters is the highlight of our visit. We simply couldn't stop - made another walking round and took more and more.Remember the opening days: Thu-Sat, closed on all other days||May 23, 2012
rosscado||40||The Borough Market has a vast range of food stalls, each selling delicious and interesting produce. We wanted to eat everything, and there was no end to the variety of foods!On the downside, the stalls are very expensive and the market is extremely busy.||May 22, 2012
Churchbelle||50||I've been around and I've been to sooooo many markets around the world. This place is top notch and there isn't one single chain store in the bunch of vendors. I have a list of favortites, but mind you've I've been to the market quite a few times! I still have so much to explore there!<b>KAPPACASEINIf there is one thing you need to try, it's the grilled Raclette sandwiches or potatoes! To. Die. For!!!<b>Richard Haward's Oysters:The oysters are fresh, so get them. <b>Pate MoiGreat substitute for live pate!<b>Le Marche du QuartierThe duck sancwich is great. <b>Appleby's Fish:Grills seafood wraps and is just absolutely grand! <b>Comptoir Gourmand:So yum!||May 22, 2012
Dale C||40||All the different food stalls and places to eat make this a worthwhile visit. If your going to cook a meal you can buy terrific local ingredients like meats, cheeses, fruit and vegetables etc. It can get quite crowded on Saturday. Be sure to stop by Monmouth Coffee for the best coffee in London and enjoy watching the crowd pass by, and the brownie here is wonderful!||May 22, 2012
Vinuala||50||If you love artisan foods, you'll love this market!||May 20, 2012
Michael M||40||Having time to kill before attending Vinopolis we wandered around soaking up the sights, sounds and smells of the wide variety of the not so readily available types of food on offer.We sampled some of the food to stop the salivating getting too bad.It is a fun place to wander around but does tend to get crowded and if you have a dislike of crowds and being jostled you should avoid it, but if you like food you should attend.||May 19, 2012
lynniemac13||50||what a fantastic place! wish we had it in Edinburgh. freshest veg, fruit, meat, poultry and baking. and olive oil, and spices, and fish....get the picture? its incredible!I had a falafel wrap for my lunch which was soooo tasty. husband bought a steak and kidney pie for his dinner - we get baking and garlic and saw the most tasty looking fish and chips!a veritable feast for the senses.don't miss it||May 18, 2012
oceanseekerDC||40||Good way to pass a few hours in the afternoon, tasting samples and admiring the goods. Some nice things to bring back home as well. Fun location surrounded by bars and restaurants to check out once the market closes.||May 15, 2012
Nikonaut||50||Lots of great food and snacks and ice cream and... and... and...||May 14, 2012
WendyCharlottesville||50||Borough Market is our permanent Saturday destination whenever we're in London. Superb food, beautifully displayed, the variety is overwhelming. Takeaways galore and then shop for the whole weekend....cheese, meat, fish, fruit and veg - that's before you start on the delicacies, truffles, pastries ....I could go on for pages. Firm favourites - Applebees for fish, Ginger Pig for superb pork, Rhuge for lamb and Mini Magoo's Granola||May 11, 2012
PrincessZeltron||40||This review is based on a visit to London more than a year ago: As someone who visits London relatively often, I must recommend that you make time in your schedule to visit this market. There is food, but not just food, mountains of food! Think pyramids of brownies, stacks of cheese, baskets of bread and just plain loads of everything delicious.I would begin with finding one of the tiny cafe style restos inside and starting your visit off with a proper English breakfast (get there early as they fill up fast).Then begin your peruse aisle by aisle and I guarantee you'll be delighted at what you see and taste and smell. There's a flower vendor outside the market, in one of the skinny streets, where you'll find tall tins and pots of flowers overflowing on the sidewalk."The Borough" as that part of town is loveingly named, is a great part of London, serviced by both Borough and London Bridge tube stations. You won't be disappointed!||May 11, 2012
DDach||50||Stop here for lunch and bring home dinner! Excellent cheeses, meats, bread or anything else you want. Find the guy w/ the cheese sandwich. It may appear to be a bit pricey but just plunk down the money, get your ticket and enjoy it! If I ever go back to London, I'll choose the closest hotel to the market!||May 7, 2012
tamcarol||50||The food is amazing. The walk through all the stalls really fun. Neal's Yard Dairy is fantastic to visit. Best bacon at the Ginger Pig.Best chocolate brownies I ever had at ion patisserie. Every stand is something new, at the French Comte we bought a foie gras and truffle pate that was exceptional.If you like food you should definitely go here.||May 7, 2012
sylviamary||40||Excellent place to go on the Southbank. all kinds of little foodstalls, vegetarian, italian, burgers, fish everything! A must see||May 7, 2012
goranich||50||This market, completely different from Camden market, focuses mostly on food, be it raw or not. It has an amazing choice of cheeses, jams, breads, fruit, vegetable, sandwiches and other food. You can come here to find food "souvenirs" to take home to your foodie friends, or just to walk, enjoy liveliness of the market and eat. Chorrizo sandwich at the beginning of the market (coming from Globe theater) is the finest delicacies you can taste, but if you want something different try scallops with bacon, of fried cheese sandwich. There is so much to taste, and so little time. If I could, I would return to that market every day, just to try one more thing.||May 7, 2012
Turnercr1970||50||Had a great couple of hours, nice mix of local and international traders and more places to grab a bite to eat or a drink than I can remember, big bargains on the fish and shellfish after 4pm too!!!! Very busy but what do you expect, also if It gets a bit too much there are plenty of bars nearby to refresh! Highly recommended||May 5, 2012
Jermiez||50||Did not expect much before I arrived but this place was much better than expected! We arrived on a rainy morning and was greeted with the smell of barbeque, sausages, melted cheese! Many stalls selling different things from sausages to toasties to gourmet cheese, paella, curry, fruits & vegs, cakes and desserts! Definitely something for everyone! ||May 5, 2012
Neilgg||40||This market offers a fantastic range of food stalls and visit lunchtime when all the office workers are tucking in. You may have to queue for your choice but the buzz is memorable.||May 5, 2012
Oliver H||50||This is one of the places that I love to go again and again! It's vibrant, has got fresh, tasty food and the atmosphere is really special. No matter if you are a tourist or a local, this market is simply brilliant - freshest food products as well as cooked food that you can eat right there and then - delicious pastries all over the place - the Borough Market is an attack on all senses - but a really nice one. Also, the whole area in which the market is located is worth strolling around - you might even enjoy joining the mile-long line in the coffee shop opposite the market and wait for a great cup of coffee (for about 20 min ...) simply watching people and taking it all in. Highly recommended!!||May 1, 2012
vegaslamb||50||This place is amazing. After many trips to London, I finally got a chance to check out Borough Market because of a recommendation from friends in town. We were blown away by the selection of foods fresh and cooked. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by duck being fried for sandwiches. They were deliciuos and crispy and only 8 pounds for sandwich and a glass of wine. We also tried the AMAZING toasted cheese sandwiches made with amazing french bread and gruyerre. There are tons of stalls with every fruit or veg that is in season, as well as great hoomemade candies. The Turkish delight stall was great and featured a ton of flavors like pistachio. When in London on a Thursday, friday or Saturday you definitely want to check it out.||May 1, 2012
CarolTLondon||50||So many fabulous foods to try. Fairly busy as we went on a sunny Saturday lunchtime||May 1, 2012
sarah_weston2000||50||This is such a vibrant, tasty place! Monmouth coffee is a highlight, and when you are weary from perusing all the stalls there are plenty of pubs and watering holes very nearby. Go with an appetite as there are many yummy stalls offering samples.||April 29, 2012
Diane S||40||Great place to wander around. You could stop at ever stall and be amazed by the produce on offer. So good to et away from supermarkets and the whole high street thing.The smells and sounds fill the air.Monmouth coffee is such a great place to stop for coffee.||April 28, 2012
Stogieman||50||Go here and savour the sounds, sights and food....OMG..... no wonder this place is called the spiritual home of Jamie Oliver !||April 27, 2012
cafeaulait95||50||During my Eurovacation 4-5 weeks every August-September, London is the place to be, after my homecountry of Finland. I lived in London for several years, my job (travel&tourism) takes me to many countries, always happy to return to the good ol'London town.||April 27, 2012
London044||50||We visited the market on a Saturday morning. We were amazed at the quality of food. They featured a lot of organic foods and smoothies. The prices were also good. They had 3 avocados in a basket for 1 pound and strawberries as well. We will definately go back next time in London and go when we are hungry.||April 27, 2012
FloridaTravelfan||50||For traditional English food and exotic food fm all over the world. Most fun is to eat and shop the various stalls. I agree that you have lunch while there and have more left over for dinner wrapped up. The smells just get your attention in a wonderful way. Great for Sat breakfast also. It can be very busy and overwhelming till you figure the layout. Worth more than one visit. Then walk over London Bridge or tour the Bermondsy area. If it's raining, it's not as much fun and can be a downer.||April 27, 2012
EmtBerkshires||50||Borough Market is not to be missed ...The only downside as with many attractions in London are the crowds ... It can be a bit overwhelming ... Other than that it truly is a place for all to go any enjoy ! ! We would have a hard time not visiting Borough Market on visits to London .. It is a great place to sample or indulge ... I fell in love with perhaps the best cheeses we have ever had .. but was delighted to take my time and look into all the stalls no matter what they were selling including yummy sweets of all kinds .. For those of us from US .. I know we have lots of open markets to shop at but I must say I have not ever seen any quite like the Burrough Market .. It is amazing .. again not to be missed when in London .. ! !||April 27, 2012

Adivije81||50||We have travelled to London many times and ensure we visit Borough Market each time! The food selection is amazing (fruit and veg, meat, cheese) as is the choice of wine, juice, coffee, etc. Produce is fresh and authentic. If you are there, stop by at Brindisa Restaurant on the corner and you will not be disappointed by their amazing tapas food. Even better, you can purchase produce from their market stall!||April 27, 2012
EmilyPeach||50||I went there on the weekend- incredibly busy and long lines, but worth it! I got a duck roll- amazing! a lovely fresh juice- delicious and refreshing, and some goats icecream- strawberry flavour- which was amazing- creamy and not to heavy! also nibbled on some free cheese around the place and got some great fresh produce including some amazing strawberries. Well worth going to for lunch, and to pick up some fresh produce at great prices!||April 25, 2012
exmontrealgirl||50||We hit the market after a busy morning sightseeing in Bankside and area. We were overwhelmed with amazing food stalls, including those selling fruit, meat, veggies, baked goods, pies (meat and other), coffee, and prepared foods to eat right away. My Husband went for a Bratwurst - and went back for another. The rest of us lined up for the most delicious grilled cheese (cheese toast here) we have EVER had! I cannot remember the exact name of the stall - Kappacassein I think...We had to choose between that or Raclette flame melted cheese over potatoes. The sandwich was huge, but we all ate until we thought we would burst because it was sooo good! We saw people eating salads, soups, meat pies, all kinds of delicious stuff. There seemed to be a lot of local people on their lunch breaks. Afterwards we walked around and bought treats to eat later, then wandered the surrounding area - very quaint, before hitting the Tube as the rain started. If you like fresh, delicious food this is a fun place. Guide books called the prices high, but we did not find it to be expensive. The vendors were all friendly and welcomed me to take photos!||April 23, 2012
PNWExpat80||50||London is a regular holiday spot for our family, and yet I've only lately discovered Borough Market. Now, I can't imagine a trip to London without stopping by for a favorite falafel, brownie or banofee pie. Imagine booth after booth of artisan breads, ethnic specialties, sweets, bakery goods, grass-fed and organic meats and every kind of hot food you can fathom. My only regret in writing this review is that more London tourists will visit what is now my favorite lunch spot in the city!||April 23, 2012
jennifer t||50||Wish I had stayed longer here insteead of going to the Tate modern, this market is filled with food and wine and loveliness! We did some english wine tasting and looked at the beautiful flowers and tasted some of the free samples being offered, such a nice place!||April 23, 2012
EWT4||50||We stumbled upon Borough Market quite by accident a few years ago and we never feel a visit to Londonis complete without a stop at this thousand-year-old market. Borough is large and a bit sprawling with a huge variety of bread, cheese, meat and other vendors, along with prepared foods. Most offer samples, which helps you make an informed decision about what to buy or eat. We normally take a full turn through the various sections before deciding what to have for lunch - a salted (corned) beef sandwich or lamb and mint burger from Northfield Market, or perhaps a kangaroo burger from the place across from the cider vendor. Try the duck comfit sandwiches. Most dishes are between four and six pounds. Might be difficult to find a place to eat but there is often open seating in the yard of the Souhwark Cathedral which abuts the market.Have some warm New Forest cider in winter months or some nice cold scrumpy or cider in spring or summer to wash down the lunch. There is also pressed orange juice, which is quite nice and a little different - the pressing process delivers more oils from the orange peels, resulting in a slight bitterness and intensified orange essence.Once you have eaten, then, and only then should you shop for a dinner or picnic. If you do this while hungry you run the risk of needing to hire a sherpa to carry your purchases. As mentioned before, there is a huge selection of breads and cheeses, olives, and preserved meats from biltong to chorizo to potted game ( including partridge, hare and pigeon), along with sweets of various types, from brownies to turkish delights to cheesecakes.Need a little something for a friend? Every berry or fruit in the fruit in the UK is present in a preserve or jam and sold here - along with raw and regional honeys.||April 22, 2012
funa||50||All the environment, the smell, tastes, colours simply fantastic||April 21, 2012
meravb||50||Go just before lunchtime, walk around the various stands, loaded with breads, cakes, cheeses, sausages and more and more. Eat at the Fine Fish! restaurant which is located in the center of the market. There are many other restaurants and cafes to eat and drink.||April 20, 2012
pgal8385||50||I'm a fan of a good market, and I wasn't disappointed by Borough Market in any way. There is a huge choice of stalls, from the traditional fish or veg, to the now common greek olive or balsamic vinegars, alongside cake stalls that you won't regret being tempted by, savoury pastries you can taste by looking at, and plenty of different cheeses. Theres a real sense that the people selling really know their food, and they're proud of it. Oh, and there's plenty of free tasters just in case you hadn't decided to buy already. Love it!!||April 18, 2012
nebuchednezzar||50||We walked to Borough Market from Tower Bridge along Tooley Rd.What a great market! Such a range of foods. We purchased some fancy cheese - Belper Knolle and a wild boar pie which was fantastic.There are also some nice cafés around to sit and relax. It's right along a church which is also picturesque. Definitely worth crossing the river for.||April 18, 2012
thebrewerswife||50||If only if were open every day! If you like food, you will love this. Everything you can imagine to eat, plenty of British specialties, esp cheeses. Don't miss Neals Yard Dairy in one of the shops around the outside.In addition to selling produce, many stalls also offer a snack of some sort & a beverage of some sort. We enjoyed chorizo rolls, salted beef & pickle buns, pies, fresh juice & Pimms! I was limited by my stomach!||April 17, 2012
Rissaroni||50||Go to Applebee's. Its a fish restaurant and might be the best one I have EVER been too. We had the fish platter and it was divine. This market has everything you can imagine from zebra meat to maccaroon's and everything in between. Loved it!||April 16, 2012
Andy62_11||50||Plenty of what I would call "posh" food here. Not cheap but losts of different foods available. Also next to London Bridge Station where if you look up, you cannot miss ;ondon's newest tourest attraction, the Shard, which reaches up into the air almost as far as the eye can see!||April 14, 2012
NunoG596||50||This market offers a huge variety of condiments. The vegetables and other products are amazingly well presented, and even if you are not planning to purchase anything to cook, the market is well worth the visit.If you are lucky enough to visit this market when someone is playing the carillon, the experience improves even more :-) ||April 14, 2012
Genesis4ever||40||Third time in Borough Market.Lots of food stalls with different food from everywhere.You can have lunch (i.e. paella) and buy food in a special Market.Only open on Thursday, Friday and Saturdays. Usually closes early.It is next to the Southwark Catheral (also worth a visit).||April 13, 2012
silvana11||50||something for everyonefresh pies, cheeses and spicesfruit, veg, meet, fish just wonderful||April 11, 2012
Agile_Lapin||50||I really, really like this place. But I brought a friend who only likes shopping at stores and eating at restaurants and she didn't have a good time. So be aware that this is an outdoor market. If you like that kind of thing, this is the best one I have been to anywhere in the world.||April 6, 2012
Ejones77rtw||50||This is a great market and if you are going to visit Tower Bridge/London Bridge, make sure you make time to walk over and check out this market. There's an outstanding variety of food and all kinds of great food that you can eat on the spot. The atmosphere is also great. Definitely a highlight of my visit to the city.||April 5, 2012
rubelmuller||50||This has got to be one of the greatest jewels this city has. Such a lovely food market. Only opens: thursday | fridays | saturdays so watch out!||March 29, 2012
carolandmickg||50||We saw this on various cookery programmes on tv and so visited. Fabulous, wonderful array of fresh food, a foodies dream, also great for photographers. Crowded especially on Saturdays but fantastic atmosphere. Grab some food and picnic in the grounds of Southwark cathedral and do try one of the surrounding pubs. A great experience, we visited twice during our stay.||March 28, 2012
LynneDevon||50||Went here on a Saturday and it was great fun! There is an amazing array of goods, food - mainly and drink to buy and more importantly taste! We grazed our way arounbd all the best the market had to offer including chocolate, cheese, pasta, cakes, wine, meats to name but a few. the range of products and fruits and meats is endless and is the best the country has to offer. It ws very busy but great fun and a fab place to visit and enjoy. There are many restaurants in the area and lots of food to eat on the hoof.||March 28, 2012
cassie02||40||A visit to Borough Market is a must..Get there at lunch time enjoy the wonderful choice of food and the great atmosphere.Its how markets used to be.||March 27, 2012
Anne M||40||Supposedly a market on this site since Roman times.... The area is certainly worth a visit - just a stone's throw from Southwark which all goes to creating an atmosphere that is pretty unique. The food stalls are as you would expect - top notch - but beware this does come at a price - nevertheless if you are looking for something special to cook this is surely the place to come. I thoroughly enjoyed wandering around the stalls - trying various goods from olives to cheese and needing longer arms to carry the trophies home - the really good bit - there was no pressure to buy.||March 27, 2012
JackieT15||40||Lovely to be able to purchase fruit and veg grown fairly locally. Really nice selection of meats, cheeses and fresh fish.||March 27, 2012
lindseyT08||50||This is such a great place to go with friends, family or just on your own! I definitely would advise going on Thursday or Friday if possible or early on Saturday or Sunday. The chorizo sandwich with roasted peppers is a must have and be sure to leave room for the amazing cheeses and truffle oils in the market. It can be a bit crowded at times but definitely worth a visit.||March 27, 2012
Anthony M||50||Saturdays is THE day to go to Borough Market near London Bridge. Go early, 9:30am. This way you're sure to get through the place at a good pace and it won't be too crowded. 1st stop is Monmouth Coffee for an amazing Flat White! Brought over from the Kiwi's its something like a latte only way less foam. Next make your way into the Jubilee Market section inside and find Flour Power for a pastry, my fav is Almond Croissant. Then snake your way through all the booths and nibble all their samples. Cheese, jams, cured meats, oils....it's all good! Then go through Middle Row and pick up a Meat Pie or some seafood or Paella. Green Market has by far the most variety. There you'll find the incredible grilled cheese sandwiches hear the backside at Kappacasein. Split a sandwich, they're super filling and go sit in the Southwark Cathedral. Have fun!||March 24, 2012
luvroma2||50||This is one of the best outdoor food markets. There are so many tasty things to buy and sample. Many of the unique foods are ethnic and/or organic, from small purveyors. The foods on offer to eat are just delicious - but the absolute best sandwich in the market is the toasted cheese sandwich at Kappacasein. They use Poilane sour dough bread and a mixture of several cheeses then grill it in a sandwich press. Near the end of grilling it, they add a mixture of garlic, onions and leeks and add a little more of the cheese, then grill it a bit longer. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! They also serve a raclette, which is roasted potatoes smothered in warmed raclette cheese. It smelled wonderful, but I always go for the toasted cheese sandwich. They are at the market Thursday, Friday and Saturday.||March 23, 2012
Hoola44||40||We have included a visit to Borough Market after reading so many positive remarks of the place and we are glad we made the trip. The market is full of interesing and colorful food products! We went on a Thursday morning so there wasn't much of a crowd and it's nice just walking around the market looking at the varieties of food available. We even had a early lunch there with sandwiches, soup and curries. The prices of the food was ok but just going to the market, looking at the products there made the trip worthwhile.||March 22, 2012
ntlchin||40||I have been in the uk for such a long time and yet this is the first time I have been to borough Market. It is a feast both for the stomach and the eyes. The colour scope of the fruits and vegetables is amazing. Cheese, hot food, cakes and pastries... Yum yum yum. Choose a starter, main and dessert all on foot and eat at the church garden. Go with an empty stomach and go early..... You won't regret it. Maybe expensive but it's a holiday and it's worth it.||March 21, 2012
Sazzle_funk||50||Borough Market is a must-see for any tourist. It's jam packed with tradition, smells, sights and tastes. It has an atmosphere like no other market I've been to. There are breads, veg, pies, cheeses...everything. Treat yourself. Prices are reasonable, great quality food. Even if you don't go to buy, the experience will make you smile..||March 19, 2012
scooterfran||50||Found this by chance, as we got off the tube at London bridge and what a delight. The atmosphere, the smells and the food were fabulous. Make sure you visit it's well worth it. ||March 18, 2012
Mergen D||50||I bought a couple of kg of responsibly farmed beef. I paid 20gbp for 2kg.There are also fantastic selection of cheeses and beer ||March 18, 2012
butgighung||50||The market opens from Thur to Sat officially (there are shops open other days too). If you don't mind the crowd, you can enjoy good food during lunch time. It's worth to wait several minutes or so. Anyway, it's a 'must go' when you are in London.||March 16, 2012
playeemobil||50||nice food stalls, and nice restaurants around. suggest to visit there in the morning to avoid the crowd.||March 13, 2012
Kesig||50||Our first sight when we turned the corner into Borough Market was of two men shaving meat from deer legs. Just beyond them, a pig's head peered out through a glass case of sausages. Across the aisle sea creatures of all types were piled high on large tables. The food stalls at the Borough Market are unbelievable! You'll find cheese and fruit and meringues as big as footballs. Local foods, exotic foods, candies and pies, spices and herbs--you name it, it's there. Even if you don't plan to purchase, don't miss the market--it's an adventure just to browse (or graze, if you're hungry!).||March 11, 2012
Tsten||50||This is a great place to visit on a sunny afternoon! ||March 11, 2012
Robert F||50||As always a shoppers paradise; this trip I ended up spending over £200 on everything from ostrich stake to some of the finest boar sausages I have had the pleasure of eating. Mixed together with great food to eat at the time, and an atmosphere money cannot buy, Borough remains the best market in Britain bar none."||March 10, 2012
jenifaabadabing||40||This place gets packed out on the weekends but, if you can handle the crowds, definitely have a wander round and pick up something tasty to eat. There are lots of samples on offer to try (the Comte cheese stand is always worth going to!) and various burgers/sandwiches/seafood/juices/salads to munch on. I recommend the award winning pork pie! Not sure the name of the butcher that sells them, but they are superb!||March 9, 2012
Spanishkathryn||50||With dozens of stalls, Borough market offers a superb shopping experience showcasing British and other produce. Great pies, meats, fresh fish, cheeses, breads ... The list is endless! Do have a wander round, and make sure you eat there too. We recently had some Colchester freshly shucked oysters which were delicious, and we can't go past Brindisa without having one of their fabulous chorizo rolls! (Brindisa also offers a really good selection of Spanish products). Plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants to eat & drink also.||March 8, 2012
dezdemona||50||If you like to stroll around on markets, this one is a "must do". It's a lovely spot right by Southwark Cathedral. A good idea is to go there around lunch time with an empty stomach, because there is so much food to sample, to try and to simply eat. Great products : especially bread and cheese to take home, all sorts of BBQed sausages and meat, wonderful sandwiches and pastries.||March 8, 2012
Krisq2||50||I didn't know about existence of Borough market untill when I was walking from my hotel to London bridge. It is a heaven for anyone who is looking for great fresh food. There is selection of cheese seafood fresh vegetables etc. As well as that you have few restaurants there too. I have eaten breakfast in Fish! It was big one and it was 2 for 1 which my friend was really happy about.Go there if you are food lover.||March 8, 2012
peterschofield37||50||Really great market we bought olive oil, partridge, kippers and veal for osso bucco. Lots of cheese, olives cakes, toffees and many stalls to get food from. The market obviously gets packed at weekends and in the middle of the day especially.||March 6, 2012
PSZTT||50||This is my idea of heaven. Have been going to the market for about 8 years and absolutely love it. There is nothing better than going early on a summer morning, and eating your way through the stalls while buying breads and fresh food of every description.Highly recommend the chocolate brownies, claiming to be the best, and they are!! There is a great little place that sells little coconut clusters in Ginger and sugar, yum, yumAnd then you must stop at the tapas bar on the corner for a drink and tapas. You can not visit London, without a stop at Borough Market. Get off at london bridge tube stop. Go hungry!!!||March 5, 2012
lizglowark||50||The Borough Market is a MUST SEE location for food lovers or anyone that can appreciate when things are done right. They have everything from homemade jams (I love "English Preserves") to fresh curry! (Furness Curries) There is an excellent selection of pantry goods, cheese, desserts, produce, and more! The best of England's agriculture can be seen here. When near the market, don't forget Monmouth coffee.||March 5, 2012
mailboxblondie||50||ok let me just say im a total foodie, and i fell in lvoe with this place and all the places around it(the rake,etc) had the chorizo and rocket sandwich which was sooo good-i would fill up here over gordan ramsay's restaurant(which i went to).you must go here and try the coffee place,grab a beer at the rake, and sample all the goods!!! ive travelled alot and my best tip for fingin good food? go where the farmers markests are- the good local places that arent touristy are all near them and at them you find great food and support local vendors and products.||March 3, 2012
JeffandElaine||50||Just a short walk from the London Bridge tube stop, Borough Market offers stall after stall of a wide variety of British foods, many ready for the eating right on the spot. Jeff is a particular fan of artisan cheeses, and a number of stalls (along with the nearby Neal's Yard Dairy shop -- their Westcombe Cheddar is to die for) feature excellent locally produced English cheeses that we assume would be difficult if not impossible to find outside of the UK. We're both chocoholics, and the excellent eating and drinking chocolates from the Artisan du Chocolat stall would alone be worth the visit. Jeff is still savoring their fabulous hot chocolate. There are also wonderful artisan breads, delicious pastries, fruits, vegetables, and meats galore, including cuts and varieties rarely seen stateside. It all makes for a fascinating and fun show. Weather permitting, the courtyard of nearby Southwark Cathedral offers a perfect spot for relaxing and enjoying a snack of whatever irresistible food items have just been purchased. Market hours are limited, so be sure to check opening times before heading over.JeffandElaine||February 27, 2012
amarcorose||50||Almost overwhelming, but a vision of beautiful fresh food, candies, vegetables and the best of all.....fresh seafood, and seafood restaurant counters. Not to be missed!. Without a doubt, the best is the combination seafood platter, (all seafood is freshly caught) A very close second is the grilled fresh vegetables especially the grilled mushrooms!. By all means go, but remember this is a popular spot and not just for tourists!. Be patient, and enjoy!.||February 27, 2012
BearAlarm||40||Despite the negative subject title, I really like Borough Market. For foodies such as myself, it is a paradise and even in its temporary location, it has a great atmosphere. You can find really fresh German bread, French and English cheese, delicious fish, organic meats and lots more besides. It's not cheap but the quality is top notch. The choice for lunch is also staggering and on a nice day it's great to eat in the grounds of the old church next door. HOWEVER... It is not the borough market of old and has lost a great deal of its authenticity and become a lot more commercial. Many of the traders are getting fed up with what they see as money grabbing management, and the overly touristic nature of the place. Most of their regulars are leaving/have left which makes the traders unhappy as they feel in their words 'like monkeys in a zoo' when their pictures are snapped 24/7. Past 10am, most of the serious local shoppers are usually gone, leaving only grazing tourists to wander around snapping photos and nibbling bits and pieces.If you want the 'real' London market experience and to avoid the crowds, either go early on Saturday morning or go on Friday. If you do happen to be there around lunchtime, I cannot talk highly enough about the fish wrap located outside Applebee's the Fishmonger. Delicious!It also helps to chat to the local traders - you will find most of them very welcoming and if you are a tourist reading this, I think both of you will appreciate the interaction.But because of the crowds, I only go there for one or two things early Saturday morning now. Most people "in the know" now go to the break away market on Maltby street under the railway bridge which is a lot more of a relaxed affair and a genuine experience. I would say both are worth checking out although tourists will probably get more out of a trip to Borough as it is MUCH larger than Maltby and there is more to keep them entertained. As a shopper, though, I now prefer Maltby - even though it is in its early days.||February 25, 2012
tomtT3060HZ||50||What a great experience - walk through the market, enjoy the fresh products, have some mulled wine, jsut relax and enjoy. It doesn't get much better!||February 23, 2012
Stevie1611||40||We stumbled on Borough Market whilst on the way to Vinopolis and I wish we hadn't just eaten!! The food looked incredible at all the different stalls and the aroma was fantastic. We hope to come back soon one day and really try everything!||February 20, 2012
AleExplorer||50||First visit to Borough Market and really enjoyed it. It's basically a glorified farmers' market with prices to match, although there are some bargains to be had in you look hard enough. Lots of bakery products, chocolate, olives, meats, fruit & veg and cheese retailers. You'll find a number of places to eat, wine merchants and the excellent Utobeer - great for UK and world beers. I'll definitely the market when I'm in London next.||February 20, 2012
Damian B||50||I do enjoy a good walk around the busy Borough market on a Saturday. There's always something new to try, but then there are always the old favourites. The street food is amazing, especially the duck sandwich.||February 20, 2012
JenJenMcMostard||40||So much to see and eat - my husband and I go to the market to sort of graze our way around. It is overpriced, but I'm hard pressed to find somewhere in London that isn't! It's just the myrriad of smells and sights and sounds and the press of the crowd that's half of the excitement. I would not do your grocery shopping here unless you need something specific and authentic - but it's a wonderful experience. Stalls sell wines, cheeses, breads, olive oils, meats, fish, and much more. Not much beyond food here, but that's what Covent Gardens is for!||February 19, 2012
Kennelman_8||40||You can see why all the foodie types and TV chefs head here, it's everything you'd imagine a Dickensian food market to be, but like Dickensian Christmasses it's almost a total fake; but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.For me La Boqueria in Barcelona is the greatest market for food, but Borough Market although smaller comes close. I had the kids and Ex in tow and we wandered around for hours, and although could have spent £100 and not regretted it, spent relatively little. That is the beauty of any market, the pleasure is wandering around. You can spend your entire money purse or - as we did - buy a couple of nice ingredients for relatively little and then make a meal at home later.If you read all of the reviews here, they're all correct - everyone has their own point of view, but given that it can cost you nothing, you have nothing to lose by going along and having a look. Just beware the game/butchery stalls though, my daughter was going through a veggie phse and there's a lot of blood and guts on display.||February 19, 2012
pwchan||30||Worth a browse and some great opportunity to buy British produce but make sure you take plenty of cash if you want to shop here. It's become rather too touristy now and has lost some of the old London feel. Unfortunately there is nowhere else in London that can compete with Borough Market for variety and atmosphere.||February 18, 2012
patolemy||50||Borough Market offers variety of exotic, fresh and delicious food with reasonable pricing. It is a must-go for food lovers. However, do note that the market is only open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.||February 17, 2012
Sunworshipper003||40||This Food Market has grown and grown over the years. it now opens on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. From kitchen ingredients to ready to eat snacks and meals, you will be spoilt for choice. Come hungry with big shopping bag and a wallet full of Notes. And in the surrounding alleys and street, cafes, restaurants and delis have sprung up. Brindisa Artisan Spanish foods, which was one of the first to occupy the market and now joined by one of their Tapas restaurant. Neals Yard is here with the best of English Cheeses but many stalls of european cheeses are also found here. And the smells of the many different food to go stalls being cooked in front of you - it will take many many visits to eat round all the stalls, cafes and restaurants. Look around carefully and you can still pick up a few bargains.The biggest minus is the location; it is not difficult to get there by Tube but it is in South London by London Bridge. Also on Saturdays, it can get incredibly busy that it is quite hard to move so if coming on Saturday come early, very early. Haven't been late afternoons on Saturdays yet....||February 17, 2012
terry m||10||i am a market trader in real living markets and i found this pretentious middle class london "dick van dyke" rip off of what was once a real market to be quite sickening, REAL markets are where people go to make a hard earned living and there are no olive sellers or £3,00 a cup coffee wallies either!!, And the ultimate insult is a pub called "the mudlark" with a jolly sign of a child in rags!!! a mudlark as we know was a starving street child trying to exist by trawling through the mud of the thames for anything suitable to eat or sell.. the whole area is a hollywood take on victorian london.||February 16, 2012
Martyn C||50||We discovered Borough Market after watching TV chefs. It lives up to its reputation and we try to plan trips to London to include a visit.||February 15, 2012
M V||50||A friend advised to visit borough market. Not really sure what to expect of the description 'a market for special food' we were blown away by the many multicultural delicious foods we tasted. For me it was a culinary experience I would advice you all to visit no matter your budget constraints. You are fully in control of all expenses.||February 12, 2012
Moosie57||50||A great place to wander around. Amazing cheese shops, fish mongers, butchers and wines. It was packed but bustling and has a huge number of restaurants to choose from. The fresh vegetables and fruits as well as the olive oils and such should not be missed. Best on Fridays and Saturdays||February 11, 2012
JanValasek||50||It took us almost a year to get to visit this market. If we would know, how much we would enjoy browsing the local products, amazing selection of fruits and vegetables, tasting one of the best soups we ever had, see the spectacular selection of heirloom tomatoes, cheeses, sausages and so on and on....If you live in London or just passing by on the way to your vacation destination, stop by for a moment! It is like a small country side feel within the busy city life. Must experience to understand!||February 9, 2012
Chrisinkingwood2||50||This market is great and has a bit of everything foodwise, whether you want to take it home or consume it while in London. Especially good if you are renting a flat or room with a kitchen! Fresh cheeses, jams and other condiments and fine meats and seafood as well as produce of all kinds and even fresh flowers! And the ready to go cooked items are a real treat, from soups and stews to Cornish pasties and fine Serrano style hams. Even wonderful sandwiches of all kinds. ||February 8, 2012
Coconuts_UK||50||I love Borough market, the food, the people, the smells. There is so much choice, a great palce to have a wander and eat lunch||February 8, 2012
shoeguy57||50||Borough Market is absolutely one of our favorite places in London. Everyone rhapsodizes about the chorizo sandwich from Brindisas and it's true. It may be the best sandwich I've ever had. A middle eastern stand (forgot the name) also has great falaffel. It can be crazy crowded on Saturday at lunch time so get there early (or go on Friday) if you have problems with big crowds. Bring your appetite.||February 7, 2012
SYBDublin||40||Defiently worth a visit, I went hungry but it meant eating a burger at 11am for breakfast! So many food stalls, a total food lovers delight. It gets very packed so arrive early. We were there in minus degree weather and got there for after 10am on a Saturday and it was very busy. Tips: shop around as some stalls differ in price. Take time to visit the Southward Cathedral which is right beside it and free to enter. We arrived via London bridge but walked back on the Southbank of the river (so the side of the river where the market is). Well worth walking back this way and through the small streets. Within less than 10 mins you are at the Globe theatre and a short stroll on you are at the Tate Modern, or cross the Millennium bridge and you are back at St.Pauls Cathedral. London is so beautiful so do as much on foot as you can!||February 7, 2012
MrCushtie||40||Borough Market is a wonderful place to go for lunch; the only problem is making a decision from all the possible choices; it runs the gamut from greasy spoons offering egg, egg, and more egg, through vats of fresh curry (Indian, Thai or Caribbean) to artisanal cheeses, sausages, pies, and most other foods that you could think of. There’s a few places offering space to sit down, but it’s a market with stalls, rather than a food court, so usually you’ll need to eat and walk, or go round to the grounds of the adjacent cathedral and eat there: thankfully it wasn’t too cold this February. If it was raining, this wouldn’t be such a good spot for lunch, but it’s still a great place to shop for some exciting food.||February 5, 2012
myhappyplace85||50||I adore Borough Market.... great atmosphere, good food, friendly people. I came home with Chocolate Brandy sauce, Chocolate Fudge Brownies and the most amazing mushroom pate. I took flat Stanley with me on behalf of my friends little 8 year old in Chicago. Everyone was friendly and let me take pictures of him. Even made friends with two of the stall holders.||February 5, 2012
kam02||30||Great for taking friends, family and visitors to this corner of London which hosts the best world cuisine in the outdoors and wonder around the stalls and only a stones throw from the River, London Bridge and the Southbank.||February 3, 2012
Veleno75||40||This market has virtually anything you may wish to eat, from all over the world.You may eat ostrich burgers, spanish chorizo, swiss cheese, terrines, any kind of fish... EVERYTHING.And it's so nice to walk this market: you'll love the smells, you'll love taking pictures if yo're a tourist, you'll enjoy the mulled wine if it's cold, etc etc.Ok, prices are a bit too high for a street market, but you pay for the quality.||February 3, 2012
Lidema90||50||I loved the Borough Markets so much I went three times while I was in London. Such an amazing vibe with loads of great foods to take home or eat on the spot! Lots of stalls and great wine varieties! It was here that I had the bench mark of all vegetarian burgers ... The haloumi burger. It was delicious.||February 2, 2012
h2onab||50||In the same ranking as Buckingham Palace, St. Paul's, Big Ben, and Westminster Abbey, is Borough Market. Open Thursday-Saturday, it is the outdoor food market for London. Visit hungry, food is everywhere. Chorizo sandwiches at Brindisa chorizo grill, wonderful cheese sandwiches, Monmouth coffee, Neal's Yard cheese, the English wine bar, and scores of other vendors to sample and take home. Be sure to bring your camera too.||February 1, 2012
Sherylcym||40||It was a great experience in borough market. U can try tradional food such as fish and chips, pork belly etc. There is also a store selling very nice Palma ham! And dun forget the always-long-queue cheese booth. They sell really good cheese toast.||February 1, 2012
Ann100London||40||I've worked near here but never visited until this weekend, the markets open Thursday, Friday and Saturday. It is full of food stalls, all good quality products with several unusual meats and loads of hot cooked food, soups, curry, burgers really good, sausages and veggie food. Cakes to die for, but eat them first. Loads of fish and vegetables, every type of mushroom. We spent a good couple of hours wandering around.||January 30, 2012
Nutmeister123||50||This gastro mecca has a lovely buzz, is really friendly and has a superb array of stalls catering for every kind off foodie passion. Whether you buy food and drink to take home or eat from one of the myriad stalls offering take away you'll be impressed. The standard is universally high. It's crowded because it's so good but the crowds add to the general good atmosphere. Lovely||January 29, 2012
JPOS_CA||50||The area around borough market is one of the earliest settlement in London - and it is steeped with history. The market itself is so much fun to walk around, eat samples happily handed out by vendors and treat yourself to an amazing coffee at Monmouth (but beware the line!). I enjoy talking to the vendors, most of whom are actual farmers or artisans who drive in from all around the UK to sell their products at Borough.I have found that the earlier I get there (it opens at 8 on Saturday, later on Thurs and Friday) the better my experience is. As the crowds descend on the area it gets more and more difficult to navigate the area and can grind ones nerves a bit. Once you have filled up on the food be sure to explore the area around Borough which includes the Golden Hind Ship Museum (replica of Sr Francis Drake's ship he used in discovering CA, etc.) and Clink, a great museum on the spot of England's oldest prison dating back to the 1100's. Other attractions are the scenic walk along the Thames, The Globe theatre as well as the more gory and teenage-packed London Dungeon. Another fun highlight is the George Inn, five minutes walk from the market and one of England's oldest pubs and saw patrons including The area is a fun and exciting place to explore, easily accessible from Jubilee Line, London Bridge stop, and taste of how London really used to be!||January 29, 2012
Lee_Andrews||50||My first visit, wow what a place. Hundreds of stalls selling top quality unusual ingredients, fruit, veg, meat, cheese, bread and cakes of every kind and a whole lot more.After your shopping why not treat yourself to a swift half in the market porter pub, a really great way to spend a couple of hours. Go hungry and enjoy!||January 28, 2012
Lacey J||50||It's very easy to get to by public transit (like most places in London). The samples of cheese, chutney, jams, chocolates, meats, olive oil, etc were wonderful. There were dozens of food stalls with delicious looking meals (I was too full on the sampling to eat a proper meal). The restaurants looked very full, I think reservations are in order if you plan to make a stop at one. The whole place was crowded and I went around 11 am on a cold winters day. I can't imagine what it would be like on a warm day in the summer.||January 28, 2012
wrenmao||50||Great place to buy food to take home - from burnt fudge, turkish delight, artisan breads, haggis, cheeses, pheasants, fruit & vegetables and flowers.... and the list goes on. Also great to wander around and soak up the vibe, grabbing something to eat from the numerous vendors offering great food. The only thing is you will have to walk around and eat, as there are not a lot of places to sit. But this seems to be the way to do it. Eat whilst you shop!||January 27, 2012
Tuhughes||50||The place was absolutely packed with people when we went just before lunchtime on a Saturday, but it was worth the crowds for the food options. We stopped by the Guildable Manor for a lamb-kabob sandwich (delicious), but we could have happily eaten at a dozen places, let alone all of the snack and sweet stalls. My only regret about our visit was that we were staying in a hotel without a useable mini-fridge, so we were limited to buying things we could fit into our stomachs right there; if I lived in the area I would probably fill my fridge every weekend with goodies from here.One shortfall; there didn't seem to be a lot of souvenir-type stuff, so if you're looking for gifts to bring home for friends or family, you may not find them here.||January 26, 2012
letsgo000||40||I remember decades ago visiting London from the US and looking forward to "traditional" fish and chips stalls, but not finding any on recent trips to London until visiting Borough Market.After reading one of the TA reviews posted in Dec 2011 by CHEZIS21 I looked forward to finding the Fish Kitchen stall. Yummy battered crisp cover over savoury cod with lots of chips. I will return on next visit to London.  And just across the small side street, at one of the stalls my wife found a great organic juice stall and enjoyed her hot pear juice--great on a chilly day!||January 26, 2012
CanadianPinay||50||Take your time and bring your appetite! There is so much to see, smell, taste, eat and buy here!This market is a must-see, and a nice change from museum and gallery visits!||January 25, 2012
L0nd0ne14||50||I'm a recent convert to Borough Market, I've lived in London for 8 years but never managed to find the time to go. I went for the first time in early Jan, I've since been back every weekend!It's a great English 'farmers market' where you can buy food to eat there and then or take home. The stall holders all have great knowledge and passion for the merchandise they are selling and it's great to be able to directly support local small businesses.This is a must for both Londoners and tourists, the setting by the Thames, London Bridge and Southwalk Cathedral makes it a good add on to any day trip.||January 23, 2012
bubbenhall_traveller||50||Love the variety of foods and drinks sold in the market. Love the atmosphere and the crowds.||January 23, 2012
gabrielan882||40||Under the London Bridge is the Borough Market, which is just amazing. The Turkish delights are the best I have ever had, by far. The variety of food is unparallel.||January 22, 2012
John M||50||We loved our trip to borough market - great history with the Clink Jail and just the history of the place. Great food everywhere we loved our time here.||January 18, 2012
Luke242||40||This is a great market, if I had any complaints though is sometimes they ahve dead animals hanging for sale ,which makes me feel sad.There are so many food options to choose from.I know this may seem crass to say in comparrision to this fresh food, but nearby I love the take-away chain near London Bridge tube... WEST CORNWALL PASTIES - cornish pastie!!! ❤ It tastes so good and I have to have one every time I visit London, they have vegetarian options too! Best I have had compared to others that tasted too salty and poor quality.||January 14, 2012
TheTraveller8989||50||I have been there several times and never get bored. You can try food ranging from king praws wraps to kangaroo burgers and drinks from mulled wine to freshly squeezed juices. Also you can buy a great variety of cheeses (find the French stand with a man with a terrible French accent, they have good stuff and deals). Top tips: Buy a pint from the Market Porter (a pub) and enjoy it ouside feeling the atmosphere of the busy market. Also, if you are into it, find the stand that sells exotic meet (ostrich and kangaroo) - once in a lifetime!||January 14, 2012
MullSkye||50||A visit to Borough market is an essential component of a visit to London. It is open on Fridays and Saturdays. The variety of food from England and from other countries and regions such as France, Spain, Italy, Middle East, Lebanon, Jordan. There are lots of opportunities for tasting. The food includes: meat of every imaginable kind, fruit and vegetables, olives, cheeses, olives, oil, bread, cakes, sweets/chocolates, yogurt, wine, ... and the list goes on. The crowds are intense and queuing for some food is inevitable, but worth the wait. Probably good idea to bring a strong bag if you intend to shop - as the small plastics and paper bags are hard to manage if you keep buying ... and buying seems addictive.||January 14, 2012
elbowelbein||40||Fun food market with lots of well-prepared foods. The 'famous' grilled cheese - yummy but excessively rich & greasy (share this one). The "Burnt Sugar" fudge is YUMMY!! And the Gorwydd Caerphilly cheese booth had THE BEST cheese - we brought back a kilo. ||January 14, 2012
Lesley2960||40||Very interesting but no good if you are on a diet!!! Also loved the little cafe outside.||January 11, 2012
Olideacon||40||A great place to grab something to eat and browse the incredible variety of fresh meet, produce, cheese, alcohol and so much more on offer. Take a decent amount of cash as you’ll invariably find something to spend it on! Brilliant for either a relaxing Saturday with other halves or friends, or as part of showing visitors around London, the only thing that stops it being 5 stars are the prices.||January 9, 2012
smeffletop||50||Oldest market in London - even if it's been moved since the 1700s. This place is AMAZING! The food is wonderful...the booths and goodies to buy are great...I found myself wishing I lived in London so I could come here and buy food to cook...it's mainly a farmer's market...but you can definitely find some things to buy and take back across the pond home.||January 8, 2012
Tureikis||40||Very nice place for a walk and snack. Full Lobster by Easy Fish is Great! Open thusday to saturday!||January 5, 2012
Kitty_McBoo||50||You must not miss this market!! I loved it so much I went back three times. They have the most amazing mushroom varieties in one of the fruit markets. The bacon bap with rocket and the Pimms booth is also a required stop.Definitely go hungry :)||January 2, 2012
BonBin||50||I've visited this market a few times and it never ceases to deliver. A wide range of foodstuffs and drinks available with the opportunity to taste before you buy. A foodies heaven. A lively atmosphere adds to the experience.Unfortunately, it has been reduced in size due to the railway engineering works, but hopefully it will be reinstated to its former glory very soon.||December 31, 2011
CannnotSleepOnPlane||40||This is one of my favorite places when it comes to food and experience new things. Borough Market is divided into several different market. All with its own focus. For example street food ready to go, bread, cheese, fruits wine and a beer shop with a great range. Many of the items sold here is organic produced and you wont leave this place hungry.||December 29, 2011
ediruzza||50||This place is a trip. Food everywhere...and mobbed. There's a guy making Italian sandwiches in the back corner...awesome. It's like going to south st. in Philly.||December 25, 2011
styles100||50||Went out of my way to visit Borough Market after seeing it on numerous Food Network UK Shows and wasn't disappointed. Cheeses, Veggies, Meat, Sauces, more cheese, vino, bakers...I could go on but you get the picture! You can spend a good couple of hours just wandering and tasting and, as everyone there is there for the same reason, it feels like a private party for food lovers! A must for foodies when visiting London.||December 22, 2011
Chezis21||40||Second visit in the past 3months and what a Foodie Mecca. This time round we had fish and chips from the Fish! Kitchen stand by the side of the road, we had Cod and Chips which was the same price as the Haddock and Chips ( double what we pay at home in Ayrshire ) It did not disappoint. Juicy thick piece of fish and nice fresh chips – not the frozen variety. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed! Did not have enough time to browse and some of the stalls were knee deep, but will be back for a third visit as this is now on our "must visit" places when we go to London.||December 19, 2011
gotravelling76||50||This is a must to visit, and i try to at least once a month. The stalls here are amazing and offer a wide range of food. You could quite happily eat and drink your way around all day. The choices on offer are huge. It can get very very busy at weekends but its always worth a visit.||December 16, 2011
onthewing||40||I visited this awesome place alone for an afternoon and was overwhelmed with all the wonderful and exotic goodies for sale in this incredible historic marketplace. If you're not in the mood for a museum, this is the place to go. It's right south of the Thames in Southwark and when you're done at the market you can stroll onto London Bridge and look up and down the river at Tower Bridge and walk along the riverside and see lots of sights. It's right at the London Bridge tube station and bus stop. A great place to come alone for hours on end. Very lively, good people watching and so many goodies to taste and buy. A great area to soak up real London.||December 15, 2011
JayP13||50||I have gone to Borough Market many times and it never lets me down. The smells that hit you from the moment you walk in are inspiring, there is always something different around every corner. From French Cuisine to Vegetarian,there is everything you would ever need which makes me very envious of the locals.You can buy fresh ingredients as well as trying the many things that are being cooked infront of you and for anyone who loves their sauces and spices, it is your idea of heaven I assure you.Do visit Borough Market the next time you are in London,you wont regret it.||December 15, 2011
patersa||50||Always love the chance to go to Borough Market - lots of lovely tastes and colours and smells - mid Saturday morning and wasn't too busy - drinking warm mulled wine - sampling butters, cheeses - spending money on great product that you couldn't get in your local supermarkets. And sun shining above on a crisp day. Christmas trees and mistletoe. Banter with stall-holders. Fun place. What could be better.||December 11, 2011
jocelynlee||40||Huge and awesome selection of food but...Tourist Central here. 1) Pie Minister: Cute pies but served cold- yuck. Disappointing2) Curry Paella: the curry was yummy but this ain't Paella. the rice is plain, white rice. don't be fooled. I liked the Carribbean curry3) Duck Confit Sandwich: tasty but definitely too salty. I wanted to dunk my head/throat in a fountain of water after the sandwichIt was hard to maneovour around...but worth a quick trip to check out the yummiesEdit Remove||December 10, 2011
holiday032||50||wanted to visit here after seeing borough market on the tv programme market kitchen it always looked quite intriguing. we got there in the morning but it was very busy but a fab atmosphere and very colourful with lots of different foods and a lovely aroma. loads of stalls to see and people seemed really friendly. we enjoyed walking around for a few hours and really pleased we made the effort to go. well worth a visit if you like that type of thing.||December 10, 2011
sandyosullivan||50||I know, I know everyone says it about Borough Market, but since Kappacasein were gone from the market for a while, the good news is that as of November (maybe they came back in October?) 2011, they are back! They really are the best toasted cheese I've ever had! People tell me the raclette is great, I wouldn't know, I only have eyes for the toasted cheese. But seriously, it's NOT all that Borough is about... they have an amazing array of food there, if you're looking for eat and go, there are a range of foods, and if you're looking for take home and cook... well, you're in for a treat. The place isn't overpriced either, not for the quality on offer. The fruit and veg is always seasonal, and often from the grower. I have to confess while the Kappa folk were off, I was stuck so I strayed and tried the fantastic grilled haloumi sandwiches from the place at the foot of the stairs... has to come a close second in any market food I've ever eaten. Tasty. Both pics are included here.||December 7, 2011
HillaryR||50||A treat to visit in more ways than one. Located on the southern end of London Bridge, it is definitely the place to go for food shopping, eating, and tasting an amazing selection of products from the UK and Europe. Most stallholders invite you to sample their goods, and eagerly offer information on their products. Crowded, so it was a slow shuffle, but definitely a pleasurable experience, and one not to be missed.||December 4, 2011
Simon W||50||This is an old food market on the left bank by london bridge tube. Oodles of fun during the day.. great walk around food, all sorts of obscure and wonderful soups and stews cooked on enormous metal paella pans. Tremendous cheeses, pickles and all things English. Bustling and a great way to spend a saturday morning.||December 1, 2011
nonlodico||40||Wholesale fruit and vegetable market, incredible quality, it deserve a visit.If you like markets , genuine food, typical location, do not miss it. You can even have a quick lunch tasting Paella, or Hot dog, or very good easy going food. English visitor eat their Borough Lunch in the garden of the Church just by.I have been so many times in London and didn't discover before..... do not miss it!The tube station is London Bridge||November 29, 2011
GaddisGadabout||50||We were at the Market by ten-ish on a Saturday and the people were already lined up for their favorite nosh. If you're a local, what a treat to buy tonight's dinner. Otherwise, graze. The toasted cheese sandwiches near the London Bridge entrance looked amazing. Cheeses, olives, meats, pies --- fun walkabout. By 11, though, it was really crowded.||November 29, 2011
DeanTailor||40||Just got back from a post Thanksgiving trip and had to get there every early on Saturday morning to make it in and out before it got really busy.I'll definitely be back close to Christmas. There's nothing like drinking mulled wine or Champagne while picking up bread, cider, cheese, and fresh herbs. Yes, it's expensive, but that's London for you.And the famous Kappacasein toasted cheese sandwich is back. Perfect!||November 29, 2011
queenic||50||I was told the market is open only from Thursdays to Sundays.. Thoroughly enjoyed the market. Please keep an empty stomach as there are so many varieties of wonderful food to eat & buy at the market. We loved the toasted cheese sandwich, the fresh oysters and the fish & chips. We are amazed by the large variety of breads & cakes available too. This place is a MUST GO! ||November 28, 2011
thebrews10||40||Whenever I go to London, I always go to Borough Market. I love wandering around the many stalls, trying things, buying things and generally enjoying the market experience that is missing in so many UK cities,The quality and variety of food is amazing.The only thing stopping me giving it 5 stars is the number of people who feel the same way as me - how I would love to go when it wasn't busy!||November 28, 2011
London_Wingz||50||Collection of the most original/organic and orgasmic stalls in London. The oysters are a must, Pork belly sandwich at Roast To Go shouldn't be missed, coffee at Monmouth is unbeatable and of course the rounds of cheese and pesto tasting from real food lovers!Opens Thurs/Fri and Saturdays.http://londonwingz.blogspot.com/2011/04/sunny-afternoon-at-london-borough.html||November 25, 2011
Sergej B||50||My girlfriend and me loved this market. We’ve seen in on TV a million times and it was one of the must-sees in London. We even stayed at a hotel right across from the market. There are loads of specialty foods and piles of breads, fruits, cupcakes, cheeses, different meat cuts, brownies, candies, etc. A lot of people buy food at the market and sit at the near by church for a picnic. This place was huge and our only regret was that we were not able to try everything it had to offer.||November 24, 2011
MangezDonc||50||Borough Market is more than just somewhere to buy food--it's a must-see stop for foodies in London. The cheeses are amazing, the regional specialties will have you battling the little devil on your shoulder--just one little French pastry, just one hunk of country cheddar, don't forget to save room for a sausage sandwich!This should be one of your first stops if you're staying in a hotel because you'll find some of the best snacks to fill up your room's mini-fridge. Make sure you bring cash, comfortable shoes, and your own shopping bag.||November 23, 2011
Adriabreu||50||Cant describe. Wonderful experience. Go hungry and have a brunch, buy some wine and be happy||November 21, 2011
Pulchra||50||Gets really busy so get there early but so fabulous I always want to buy everything.||November 21, 2011
ne1a||50||Rosé spritzer, veggie burger from heaven, delicious meat pies of all kinds... and even more amazing delicacies I can't wait to go back and try = can't wait to go back to London just for this food!||November 20, 2011
LancsLad2||40||A real cornucopia. Great produce, though is now a middle class foodie heaven rather than a working market. If you accept it for what it is, it's a very good experience. Borough market gets very busy on Saturdays, so probably best to go on Thursday or Friday. Nice walk along south bank to and from.||November 19, 2011
Linda R||40||If you are a meat eater you should try Northfields Farm Stall and to make life easier try Turnips (which is opp) for your vegatables.My arms ache from carry heavy bags,but as Arnie said "I,ll be back" Lots of stall to enjoy and even if you only browse I,m sure you will enjoy the day||November 18, 2011
CRAIGP001||50||I live in London and pay regular visits to Borough Market. One thing to note is that if you arrive too early 8-9am the stalls are just setting up. Aim to get there around 10am just before all the crowds. This market is heaving by 11.30am so be warned. Have a good wander around all the stalls many of them will let you try what they are selling. Especially good for Olives, Rustic Bread and Cakes. Dont forget to take a wander around the little streets outside as there are some fantastic small food shops. Then when finished take a walk around the back of the market and it brings you out at the southbank where you can take a walk past all the street entertainers all the way back up towards the London Eye passing the Tate Modern. A great day out but take good walking shoes.||November 15, 2011
DonkeyRhubarb||50||This place is a must if you go to London, it gets very, very busy though at the weekends but if you want some tasty tasty food this place is a definite visit! You will smell the Paella as soon as you walk down the stairs and then the cooking of sausages and burgers from all of the other deli meateries! There are some amazing cakes on sale and the cheese, which you will smell your way to or away from!!! Through the other side there are more market stalls selling all types of food too, this will keep you busy for a good few hours and there are a good few coffee shops too and a bar or 2 at the back! ||November 15, 2011
Amaya W||50||When you think of London, this is not the place that comes to mind. You think, Tower of London, British Museum, Tate, Big Ben, etc - BUT. This should be the FIRST place you think of - well, mostly because it is an AWESOME start to a perfect Saturday in London. This place is great for a grazing lunch filled with some of the freshest, and least expensive options in London. Head to the Roast-to-Go (the to go version of Roast restaurant) for a cracking and applea sauce sandwich, or Brandisa for a just grilled chorizo bap - or better yet - try all the local cheeses.. meats.. veg.. breads.. then walk a short 10-15 minutes down the river and check out the Tate.. South Bank.. and Big Ben (across the river). This walk can be long - but you can do with some crazy good food to start!If you have families, I might suggest going around 2:30-3pm when the crowds are fewer.. or early before lunchtime...Bring Cash, the ATM lines can get long||November 11, 2011
GRK56||50||If you like food & drink, this place is a must. All manner of food available, with many many different cuisines to choose from. The only possible downside is that it is very busy, but that is down to the markets success.||November 11, 2011
abcdefghijkl||50||Something different to do in London. Great choice of food lots of variety as well.||November 4, 2011
matncharl1||50||We were amazed at the borough market. Both tried some the local delights, including a super burger for 5.99. I would recommend just going, standing outside and taking in the smells. Very busy (Friday), but great atmosphere. Definately recommend for those who either love food or just eat it!!||October 31, 2011
Liz C||50||Must visit the wonderful Borough Market. It full of the most delicious food stalls. A lively interesting place for all people who love food.||October 27, 2011
Meyhofer||50||You will find from fish and chips to paella and bratwurst. There is something for everybody's taste. The full market is only open on Thu, Fri and Sat at lunch time, which is a shame. I recommend the Spanish chorizo and pepper with rockets or the Fish and prawn canjun wrap just outside the market. If you like oysters that is the place to go too, there is a small stall that only sells fresh oysters and other shells, huge ones from scotland and Ireland.||October 14, 2011
Anna G||50||This market is best on Saturdays, go before lunch time to avoid a scrum!The food is beautiful, fresh, some rather unusual such as delicious cheeses, biltong (dried meat) wonderful baked goods, heavenly (but expensive) veggie deli stuff, pies, cold meat.. you think of it, you can probably find it here! Well work a look round if you love food, sit and have your lunch in the grounds of Southwalk Cathedral.||October 9, 2011
kiwisontour||50||These markets are great to wander around with such a great selection of food on offer.I would definitely visit again when next in London and would suggest they are an integral part of any trip to London.||October 6, 2011
Owenthomas||50||We have been many times, and usually go on a Friday or Saturday. Get there early though, because it gets very busy. They also have lots of gluten free and dairy free products. Lots of samples available and the cheese selections are enormous. It is always one of the highlights of our trips to London. It is easy to get to by taking the tube to London Bridge. It was also a great destination after a brisk morning walk from Waterloo Station along the Southbank.||September 28, 2011
TravelQueenie365||30||Overall experience is good and i will definitely be back to get some fresh produce like fruit and vege from there. However the ready to go food is quite expensive. They do have a stall selling Roast pork with apple sauce but its about 6 pounds with a small portion. Another stall selling thai seafood and chicken curry rice at 5 pounds. Pretty pricey. This place is mainly just tourist attraction and get the feel of how is like to shop at a high-class market. We popped by a turkish store and bought some turkish delights, wasn't very fantastic but still good as a sweet snack. There are a lot of stores selling cheese and wine too..overall experience is alright but not fantastic like other markets such as Brick Lane||September 28, 2011
What||50||Anyone who is interested in good food MUST come here. Make a special trip to London. When planning, though, know that it is only open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays (some peripheral shops and restaurants are open daily).There is no end to the delights on offer - duck snadwiches, fabulous pies (game, lamb and apricot, venison, for example) cheeses, hams, meats (we bought the tastiest lamb we have ever eaten), fish, fruit and vegetables, wine, olive oil and everything else a gourmet could dream of.I love food markets and the only rival to Borough Market that I have been to is La Boqueteria (?) in Barcelona.Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous. GO!!!!!!!!!!||September 27, 2011

Travelalot31310||50||Borough Market is a 3 minute walk from our flat that we rented in London. We went on Saturday morning September 17 to get some provisions and were blown away at the selection of items and quality. We bought fresh veggies, beer, wine, eggs,meat pies, desserts and jams. We went about 9:00 AM and spent about 3 hours there. Its gets very busy after 11 and the crowds were substantial. My only complant is the Market is only open Thurs-Sun with many of the stalls open Sat-Sun and we cant shop there everyday!||September 18, 2011
perstef||40||This market is lovely, charming, delightful, but sadly not a lot in the fruit and veg dept, although that seems to be a way of life in the UK. I loved it oh so much but wanted oh so much more out of it, having been spoiled by markets in other cites. Yes, it's a foodie haven in otherwise foodie barren London. I'm not saying the food in London is bad, it's not, it's just missing a lot of what I've gotten in other cities and countries. And I'm not saying I've tried every nook and cranny in London, I haven't, and I'm not saying this market isn't good. I'm saying that for a market in London this is like heaven and if you are visiting and don't get to see/experience this place you are missing out on one of the most fantastic experiences London has to offer. Not only did we see fabulous butchers galore, but cheeses to die for (DO NOT FORGET NEIL'S YARD SHOP!!!), ethnic stuffs, and hard cider right out of the cask that will knock your knickers off!!! (I'm not kidding, mind yourself here, it's powerful stuff). Go here and eat the brauts, munch on an empanada (Argentine-style), eat baklava and ice cream and try the treacle fudge. Then walk, walk, walk to find that blasted tube station - a good calorie burn. Or better yet hit a pub and enjoy the local color.||September 17, 2011
McAnnie1||50||I wish I lived in London & could visit this place every week. It's a food lovers paradise and a must see for tourists to prove to them that we do actually take food seriously in the UK & have food to die for. Pick up samples & a great lunch & enjoy!||September 13, 2011
weennee||50||Borough Market makes you look at markets in an entirely a different perspective.... This market is so lively with so many varieties! Everything is so tempting... left, right, front, back... and best part is there's so much samplers u get soo full just trying them!Had so much fun trying the ham, cheese, mulled wine, paella, and inhaling all the different smell of food & fresh fruits!Cant wait to go again...||September 12, 2011
BrazPilot||40||A busy place during lunch hours.The smells and flavours are fantastic.Grab a food on the market and enjoy it on the garden near the church!A must go!||September 4, 2011
SoCalFoodie||50||If you visit on the busiest day, Saturday, be prepared to wait and push your way through the crowds.But oh is it worth it.Plan to arrive around your lunch time, as this is an eating destination.||September 3, 2011
TKB001||40||I live around the corner from the market and love to get nibbles from the market. But I know not to visit the market after noon, because it just gets way too crowded after then. Afterwards, there are a lot of other interesting places to visit in the area which are walking distance from the market, like Shakespeare's globe, Tate Modern museum, Southbank and London Eye.The market is open on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Some shops and most restaurants are open throughout the week and there are quite a few good restaurants to try out (Brindisa tapas, Roast which has a great view of the market, Wright Brother which specialises in fish, etc).Borough market has has something for any foodie. Personally I go there for the olives, chocolate, wheat grass shot and Spanish chartchuterie. Definitely worth a visit, but avoid the crowds and go early.||August 18, 2011
lemonloaf||50||What a treat for the senses! The smell of delicious foods, the sight of fresh produce/ creative cakes/ pastries/ baklava/ spices/ cheeses/ cakes, the little samples of cheeses and sausages (plus of course you can purchase all sorts of quality foods that you may not be able to find elsewhere (be warned - it's not a cheap place!), the sounds, the hustle and bustle.... Definitely worth many repeat visits. The only downside was that we didn't see much sit-down space for a picnic.||August 15, 2011
Ciaran B||40||I visited here twice whilst in London - once on Thursday and once on Saturday. I'd recommend a Thursday visit as pretty much all the stalls were open but the place was half as busy. On Saturday it was a bit of a crush. It is really just a large farmers market - there are plenty of stalls offering cheese, meats, fish, bread, fruit and also some hot food. The stalls are nice and the food is generally good quality although it is pricey, as you'd expect.Nonetheless good for a wander if you're in the area. Very close to London Bridge Railway/Tube station and the London Dungeon etc.||August 13, 2011
JPSLittleAston||50||Arrived in the city for a long weekend break. Checked into hotel and went for a pleasant stroll. One of the first places we came across was this little gem!Biggest problem - which stall to visit first, with such an array of colours, displays and goodies. Varieties of different produce I'd not seen before! - a real education.Wonderful cakes, sweets, chocolates etc on display and such a relaxing atmosphere.You will not leave without wanting to try something this market has to offer.Not to be missed.||August 12, 2011
Geordiefatther||50||Love this market. Food can be expensive but plenty of free samples. Great sandwiches available. If I lived in London I would hope could afford to buy my food there. Excellent day out.If you need a toilet or a quiet cup of tea ( and nice food ) go to the Cathedral.||August 8, 2011
nmv712||50||We visited the market in the morning before walking overto the Globle Theatre. The market filled all of our senses. Sights, sounds and taste! We walked thru the entire market. First stop was the sangria stall. Then we retraced our steps. Each one of us from our group of 5, selected a different food and we shared! Easy walk to the Globe for an afternoon play. Plan ahead to make this a Friday agenda.s||August 4, 2011
hairybear007||50||when in london we always have a mooch around borough market,for us out of towners,its fascinating,and i,m sick of all the chain restaurant places,you must make time to visit this food heaven of a place if thats your bag you will not be dissapointed,dont forget the side streets,its great to browse and could take an hour or so,can get crowded at times,but its very interesting.||August 3, 2011
Joycie0274||50||Borough Market is the place for a foodie. The meats, cheeses, breads and produce are fantastic. Wear walking shoes and bring an appetite. There are lots of vendors cooking food on the spot. The best things we ate were: duck confit sandwich (a fat sandwich of duck pieces fried to crunchy goodness) and a chorizo and piquillo pepper sandwich. We also picked a small loaf of bread and a chunk of Neal's Yard Dairy cheddar to eat later in our room. We were there on a Thursday and it was busy, but not too busy. It's probably crazy on the weekend. We would have bought lots more but we didn't have a kitchen and we were near the end of our trip.||July 31, 2011
PermanentNomad||50||I shop at Borough Market on a regular basis. I get bread and cheese from Neal's Yard; eggs, quail and other fresh meats from Sillfield Farms; and everything Spanish from Brindisa. There are a number of vendors selling fresh vegetables, and I especially like the Saturday after 4:00 pm bargains. The options are endless. It is paradise for foodies. Most of the stores/vendors are open only Thursday, Friday and Saturday, but some are open during the week as well. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday come hungry and try a falafel, german bratwurst or any other of the goodies offered. It is a "must" for anyone who loves food.||July 29, 2011
citycrush||50||I know that Borough Market has a bad rep as touristy and pretentious, but I really enjoyed our visit to it. I live in deep rural countryside and so gourmet olives, cheeses and pastries are just (sadly) not part of my every day food routine! It was nice to have lots of different stalls in one place selling quality produce.My friend and I spent a very pleasant hour wandering round the market while on the way to the Tate trying samples of various honey, cheese, olives, wine, chocolate. We bought some really interesting produce and it was definitely a highlight of our trip. It is absolutely packed with people, but I would really recommend it for an hour or so. It is perfetly situated to then wander by the river down to the Tate Modern.||July 29, 2011
Anna56||50||We've seen Borough Market on tv before and have always wanted to go, and i'm so glad we did.Its in a slightly out of the way part of london, but don't let that put you off. Its right next to Southwark Cathedral and about 5 mins walk from the Globe Theatre and the Tate.The market is spread over a few different sections which all jumble their way under the rail way bridges and archways. The stalls are far too numerous in variety and quantity, but suffice to say - if its food related then they'll have it here. The fish in particular was really spectacular. We bought olives, cheeses, fruit and a game pie for a little picnic lunch by the river. Brilliant place to spend 30-60 mins wandering round and exploring. The stallholders were all very friendly too. There's lots to try as you're walking around and too many delicious things to buy.If you're in to food then stop by, it really is worth it.||July 25, 2011
Samm020||50||I vist Borough market every year when I go to London. If you love food, are not afraid of crowds and willing to stand in line for 15 minutes for a great burger: you're up to have a great time. What can I say that has not allready been said by others on tripadvisor? Well, I can give you some tips:Take a shopping bag with you.Have a Pimm's or two (cocktail, not too heavy on alcohol)It's better on a sunny day but most of the stalls are in the hall.If it's busy, don't avoid the stalls with long lines. You'll end up standing in a line anyway: if there is a line at one stall, they're everywhere and probably worth the wait. Take time: I can walk around the market for two to three hours without a problem. Taste everything: you're supposed to. They won't be pushy and try to sell you stuff, really, they're too Brittish.||July 14, 2011
JohnGrease||40||Visited the market during my trip with my wife. The place is just electric with people and food - lots of choices for every budget. Make sure you come on one of the days the market is open (Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays only) and explore, then eat. Don't miss the market - across the street from the London Bridge tube station.||July 13, 2011
chichiSouthCarolina||50||Anything and everything related to food is under one covered area. This is a foodies delight.||July 7, 2011
jujubean101||50||We visited this market on a Saturday morning. Even though we were heading back to the States the next day and could not purchase much of the food, it was a not-to-be-missed experience. My fourteen year old daughter and I spent a few hours there before heading to Camden Markets. It made a very fun last day in London.||July 4, 2011
HikerTraveler||50||What fun! Every type of food vendor you can think of. Beautiful displays. We had lunch here twice during our 9 day visit. Munched on so many things, plus sampling. Weekends very busy and crowded.||July 2, 2011
fiona229||50||Wonderful market and not very crowded on a Thursday. Great choice of food stuffs. Can highly recommend bread from De gustibus which is very nearby.||June 30, 2011
BanditJamshedpur||40||Borough Market in London is a Mecca for foodies, yet hardly any tourists visit the place.The are a million food and condiments stalls all crowded together giving the impression of an Asian food market.You get everything fromHamburgers to exotic sea foot and everyone is offering free samples to taste. Special attraction is a store offering the very best of English cheeses all sourced directly from the producers. Again, sample all you wish.Great way to spaend a morning in London. Can be easily reached by Tube, bus or boat.||June 28, 2011
hil22||40||A very nice food market open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.||June 23, 2011
divadebone||50||This is a wonderful market selling all kinds of food and drinks. There are numerous stalls selling really good quality and unusual produce. We got ourselves a glass of bubbly from one of the stalls and drank this whilst browsing the market. You can sample most of the produce and although some products are a little pricey, you'll find really great quality here. We sampled a big array of things, cheeses, dressings, oil, meats, pate, bread - the list goes on. There are also plenty of hot food stalls where you can have lunch. We opted for a lovely catalonian stew with paella - absolutely fresh and delicious at under 7 pounds per head. There are some seating areas were you can sit and have lunch. We arrived just before 11am on a Saturday and it was still OK to wander round, not too busy. We popped into the pub at the entrance for a drink and afterwards went back for another wander at around 1.30pm - by this time it was extremely busy and quite difficult to make your way through the crowds - so the earlier you can visit the better. If you are in the least bit interested in cooking or food this market is a must to experience. We'll be back for sure - next time with a cool bag and ice pack so we can buy more cheese from O'Neil's Cheese shop at the entrance. This market is a wonderful way to spend a Saturday morning.||June 21, 2011
GracemcCarter||20||Came here with my mum and granted, it was around lunchtime so I'm sure we picked a bad time to visit. But there were just far too many people. You couldn't get near any stalls and you had to queue to get free samples of anything. I'm sure all the food was really fantastic, but what I saw was horribly overpriced and the whole experience was marred by it being literally grid-locked with people. Sure it'd be different if it was sunny weather and early morning, or later in the day when I expect there would be lots of discounting going on. I'll give it another go as people I know rave about it, but was just a bit underwhelmed myself.||June 21, 2011
Progressive1978||40||Great Market! Especially for foodies! Lots to see and most importantly, taste. The stall-holders are all very friendly and offer lots of free tasters. The best part of the experience is the traditional-ness of the place. It still has that Cockney charm. I'll be back!||June 15, 2011
TrnrMom||40||We went to the Burough Market after touring the Tower of London (take the bus & get off the stop after the train station). It was great fun - both for the food & the atmosphere - watching the locals line up for sandwiches stuffed with pan fried pork or chicken cooked on enormous pans. Cost is 5GBP and is a great meal. Of course you can practically make a meal of the samples that are available. We weren't there on the day that the famous grilled cheese sandwich place was open (or completely missed it), so weren't able to try that.We went across the way to a pub to get brew to take out but there are more gourmet selections within the market. We also got fresh strawberries (1 GBP) for dessert and snacking. Look for bags of "booboos"- misshaped chocolates for 1 GBP. We ate those our whole trip.||June 13, 2011
melemike||50||borough and jubilee market great place to eat, take pictures and meet owners / chefs. pubs, flower shops and a churchyard where everyone goes to picnic on the food they bought. near thames and other sights. we walked to globe and millenium bridge.||June 13, 2011
TravellerAnnie||50||I try to find a local food market to visit on every trip - anywhere where I travel. Borough Market is one of the best I've visited in a while. It's reasonable in size and easily accessed with public transportation. I visited Borough Market during Saturday morning and found the atmosphere relaxed. There is a lot of tasting going on, and this gives the buyer a wonderful opportunity to sample products prior buying. I would recommend to take your time in the Borough Market. Buy a coffee / tea / fruit juice to go and wander along the corridors. See, taste, compare. And as my souvenirs tend to be food - I can recommed hand-made chocolate and fudge. Or perhaps you would like to take home selection of curry spices?||June 5, 2011
scoobydigby||40||Friday morning was not too busy and good to look around; the market on a Saturday is rammed and it's difficult to get close to some of the stalls. There's loads of food to test and taste before you buy and many different things that you just dont find in local shops. My favourite was melted cheese on new potatoes and huge meringues....in fact dont eat before you go and dont book anywhere afterwards! The atmosphere is great and I keep going back!||June 3, 2011
DiDiY||50||If you are interested in all things related to fresh food it is well worth a visit to this market just to see the different produce available, Wonderful fresh fish, meats and vegetables, with lots of pies, etc, of all varieties. If you are looking for touristy things then try Spittalfied. There are many stalls sellng various foods to eat there or take home. We just wished we had cooking facilities where we were staying.||May 31, 2011
karyote||50||I brought my parents to Borough market on a Saturday after the changing of the guards and what a great decision it was. We thoroughly enjoyed walking around trying all the food. Of course it was a little pricey but totally worth the quality food we get. Had garlic prawns wrap, falafel, iced tea, fish&chips, green curry with rice.. took home a few loaves of freshly baked bread as well! Took bus C10 to Borough Market and it was a short 5 - 10 minute walk to the market from there. If I had the time I would visit it again!||May 30, 2011
British_lover||50||How to get there:Take the Jubilee line (Grey) and get off at the "London Bridge" tube station.As you go out of the tube station, just turn right and follow the crowds (yes, there are a lot, a lot of people there on a square centimetre.The Borough Market(s) is formed by two, smaller ones: the Jubliee Market and the Green MarketBefore you are ready to leave, be sure you don't plan much else for that day because you are likely to be overwhelmed by the crowds and spend much more of your time there than it was actually planned.I've got to see a lot of fruits, vegetables, kinds of meat, cheese and sweets. Some of them are pricy, some of them are not..be picky and try not to fall into buying too much: Walking around the market is going to be even harden with a heavy bag, not to mention with many bags plus you are likely that will carry home food you won't eat!Something else about the area..It's not advisable to go there by car since the streets around the markets can be considered closed (there are just too many people for the cars to pass)There are restaurants and bars around the market but they tend to be pricy because, obivously, many people go to the market.There are very few chairs to sit on in the market so most of the people will sit wherever they can : on the pavement, on some stairs..it's all fine if you behave politely!||April 21, 2011
Furman55||50||Totally worth it. If you can make it around lunch time, be ready to eat. There are so many amazing stops in the market, and vendors are more than happy to provide some samples. Even then, the food is reasonable and it makes for a great mid day stop||April 19, 2011
ChunkyAl||50||OMG - never believed my friends recommendations of this market. We went by tube - DON'T GET OFF AT BOROUGH TUBE - it's a LONG walk. Especially in the rain. We went on a cold and wet day but when we got there we soon warmed up with the spiced cider and the home made pastie. Then we shopped for food - great bread, meats, cheeses, speciality foods - get the organic filled pasta - wow! And the freshly cut salamis! We wish we lived closer as there was great veg and fish as well. We did spend quite a bit - well you do pay for quality ! But we had a great few hours there - very full, very tired, very laden down with shopping and wet through we returned home with our wonderful wares! You must go and take large shopping bags.||March 19, 2011
DressedInArt||40||The Borough Markets is truly an experience for a food lover or indulger. I was amazed at all that I saw and appreciated the open market feel and the personal touches of each stand. There is great variety - everything from German to Indian to organic even. It was my first time going to a market in England, let alone an open air market all together. I was starving, not having had lunch at 3 p.m. I decided to try the home range chicken burger for 3.50, which was just about the most right choice I could have made; I loved it and the bread/bun it was in it was something else. I continued to admire the cakes on display, buying myself a slice of cheesecake for 2.50 from a place that had such great variety! I even bought chocolates from the West Indies, which had caramel and was made of crepes according to the label; not the cheapest, but it was amazing what selection there was. It seems like this would be a great place to grab a quick bite to eat if you're passing by; but then again I'm not a local so maybe once you've goten used to the selection there then you aren't amazed. This place reminds me of the St. Lawrence Markets back home in Toronto. I definitely recommend you visit the Boroughs for yourself!||March 18, 2011
michelle1986||40||My sister and I visit Borough Market yesterday and really enjoyed it.It wasn't as busy as it exspected especially being half term. The food looks lovely, very high end and boutique cheeses and hams.Cakes looked good too!||February 24, 2011
NHORNurse||50||open Thurdays, Fridays & Saturdays this is the place to get any kind of fresh food I have found so far. from Meats, fish, vegatables, cheeses, pastries and more. Gets crowded with people looking for fresh foods. Many samples available to taste.||February 14, 2011
Joanne F||50||Incredible food market, unusual ingredients from all over the world, many local and organic vendors too, fun to wander through the windy paths to stumble upon Neil's Yard, maybe the best cheese purveyor in the world (apologies to Murray's). Pick up lunch at the wonderful curry stand - serving 3 types of curries (when we went, Thai seafood in green curry, Caribbean, and Vietnamese) out of huge vats, for 5 pounds over rice or 7 pounds for a large portion w/ rice (it's worth it!). Or stop at Maria's for English breakfast. Check out local cheesemakers, purveyors of ostrick and other exotic game, gorgeous breads, wine and beer shops. If I lived in London I would be here every day,||February 12, 2011
abreise||50||This charming market offers all kind of great, international food, from Spanish Chorizo Sandwich, fresh oysters, but also lots of cheese, fruit and vegetable. First time we came Friday afternoon - which was obviously too late for the market as most stalls closed already. Seems like the best time visiting the market is Saturday brunch/lunch and you should rather be hungry!||January 30, 2011
TobyandChewie||50||I was glad to have visit Borough Market. We went on a Friday and it was extremely crowded! I was happy to have found the legendary toasted cheese sandwich, which did not disappoint! Come with an empty stomach!||January 16, 2011
k1w1brad||50||Come one Come all.Foodie or not - you can't pass a visit to Borough Markets when you come to London.For those on a very tight budget then how about a free lunch with the freshest of ingredients? Simple, most stalls have samples for all to try. Try 1 or try 4 pieces from your favorite stall(s) and before you know it you'll be full. Just bring a bottle of water with you.For those of us that live there or visiting it's a great place to get your fresh produce, meat, dairy, juices or lunch on the run. Actually we've picked up alot for picnics.This will take at least half your day. Best to visit first thing in the morning otherwise it'll get very busy come lunchtime.Toasted sandwiches? Just have one. You'll see why.Here is my video of these guys: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yorf6BERSogFor a deeper insight on this Market here is a thread which will go through many of our favorites and what not to miss: http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g186338-i17-k3624244-Borough_Market-London_England.html||January 10, 2011
Mr0liveiraR0cha||50||Good food, looks like authentic...I strongly recommend the chorizo's sandwich. Go early or in the and of the evening, to avoit the gigantic queue.||January 4, 2011
girllexie74||50||We went early on a Thursday afternoon in late November. We had planned to stop for lunch as part of our stroll along the South Bank. The market was pretty busy at that time. In fact, lots of hustle and bustle in the area in general. It seemed like there were lots of tourists as well as local workers popping in for a quick lunch. LOVED the toasted cheese sandwich from Kappacasein (craving it daily since returning home). Lots of great things to look at at and taste, as well as some good people watching. We had hoped to stop by again before leaving London (for another toasted cheese!) but sadly did not make it. Borough Market is definitley on the top of our "to-do" for the next trip.||December 6, 2010
TexasLavenderLovers||40||I'm sad that we ate breakfast at the hotel before we came to the market. It was an absolutely freezing day in late November, but the place was very crowded. There was so much great food I wished we had a kitchen where we could prepare some of the stuff we saw. This is an award winning market and I can see why. Maybe a food market isn't for everyone, but if this is your thing then this is worth a visit. We went on a Saturday morning to see the maximum number of vendors.||December 5, 2010
mr_rushLondon||30||Borough Market has become hopelessly overcrowded. The produce remains interesting but it is a struggle to get around on the weekend.||November 27, 2010
JaySackwild||40||Great market with great food. I love the free samples of cheese, oils, brownies, etc. The food that you can buy is not too overpriced either. Only bad thing for me would be that sometimes it is too busy, which is fair enough because they want to sell products. But the free samples keep on being taken by others, I like to walk around about 5 times and get loads of free samples. Great place to go to.||November 1, 2010
emily2709||40||Huge food market with lots of choice and some unusual items to eat there or take home. The market is also surrounded by nice cafes where you can also eat. It is easily accessed from London Bridge tube station, is mostly under cover and is a nice place to go for lunch, especially if you are visiting nearby attractions such at the Tate Modern.||October 17, 2010
laurakevn||50||I love Borough Market! Our last visit to London we spent the good part of a day here, wandering the stalls, sampling amazing local foods, and stopping every so often back at the warm cider barrels to stand with a pint and people watch. We left with bags of goodies and hundreds of photos of... food! I dream about the barrels of olives and wheels of cheese the size of tractor tires. And mulled wine.... fresh shucked oysters.... chorizo sandwiches. Mmmm! Such a fun, vibrant place. Despite it being quite toursity, it feels authentic. And there are certainly loads of locals wandering around as well. So worh the visit. I think it's only open Friday and Saturday morning/early afternoon though?||October 4, 2010
travelgirls79||50||Borough market - even though advertised in many travel guides - is still one of London's great finds. Go there on a Saturday and Sunday to get the full bustle of Londoners doing their weekend's shopping and tourists having a look at a mideval market. It's a fantastic atmosphere and you can buy anything you heart desires. From specialty foods to grilled cheese sandwiches. It all smells fabulous and most of it is organic. Yes, the prices are a bit high, but after all this is London and it's a once in a lifetime experience.Go around and sample, it's a good way to experience the flavour of Borough Market and a nice chat with the merchants is also usually included. The have great stories of where their food comes from.||September 8, 2010
Gwelly||30||Not much to say about the market - plenty of these "farmers markets" accross the UK offering great local food - just don't bother with the fish and chips at UKP7.95 under the bridge. I should have realised at that price they were a rip off!! Not even good chips!||August 26, 2010
OGONTOUR||30||I was really looking forward to going to Borough Market. I was only in London for 2 days and this was on the top of my list to do. I had never been before and had heard great things about it. I visited on a Saturday in July and it was so crowded with people – this made it a little uncomfortable as it was really difficult sometimes just to wander around and look at the stalls at my leisure and have a bit of lunch like I was hoping to do. Instead I kept bumping into people everywhere and there were long queues for all the take away food stalls. Maybe I should have gone earlier in the day? Because of this I didn’t enjoy it as much as I though I would have and was disappointed because of it. I would go back again though but maybe at a different time of the year when it mightn’t be so overcrowded.||August 9, 2010
Selloy||30||Well, I must say I was disappointed on this one … ok, it’s a nice market but not that really great and the prices were strange, there was things really expensive…well…maybe for tourists? I don’t know but it deserves a visit if you are nearby.||July 28, 2010
andrewlwalsh||50||Visited Borough market on a Saturday morning to get some breakfast and have a look around. It is full of character and great fresh product. Lots of people. Lots of traffic moving through laneways delivering food. If I lived in London I would be here weekly to buy food for the weekend. Look forward to visiting again.||June 26, 2010
LondonChillie_man||10||20 years ago I lived in Borough and the market there was a fabulous working class market and each Saturday I would do my week's shopping there.Nowadays this place is a disgrace. Overpriced, stuffy, stalls selling yuppie foodstuffs at yuppie prices. I would guess this place has found it's way into tourist guides judging by the many tourists you encounter who think they are getting the British "real market" feel.Last visit I vowed would be my last as I took a bus to Brixton where 1 of the 8 fishmongers in Brixton market was selling exactly the same fresh prawns as in Borough, but at almost half the price.Avoid.||June 6, 2010

Jannerbloke||50||Every city or town should have a proportionate version of this. No hypermarket or precious deli can compare or compete. The very best of the produce of England and much of the world all fantastically displayed, sold by personable informed traders, competitively and reasonably priced and never disappointing.||April 24, 2010
SimplyAmerican||40||We visited after eating at Tapas Brindisa (close by) so we weren't hungry on the spot, which was good! We did buy some food to bring back to our flat, and are glad we did. The highlight was Chorizo sold at a stand right outside the Brindisa store, it was delicious. Also bought some meat pies to bring home for later, and a beautiful pan of brownies. If you've rented a flat for your visit I highly recommend stopping by so you can stock the larder with something unsual for late night snacking or a meal at home.||April 20, 2010
TokyoBob1975||50||Visited on 3 April 2010. A short walk from the London Bridge Tube Station.Ate a bacon sandwich, sausage butty (sandwich), and a grilled cheese sandwich. Each were unique Recommend you visit early because it got very crowded. Crowd spills over into the courtyard of an adjacent church.Most of the food items appeared to be consumed on site. There are a few shops that cater to people (not tourists) with a kitchen--meat, fish, vegetables, goumet wines, etc. Would be interesting to visit at different times of the year to see how the variety of goods change with the seasons.||April 11, 2010

My son is a fussy eater and going around this market he got the opportunity to try new foods which means he is willing to eat new foods such as olive oil and cheese etc... (which we bought as he liked them so much). A must if you are going to London as it is central and if you go to the website has events on too. Best market in the London!||November 28, 2009
cpgolf2||40||This is THE place to be in London any Friday from lunch through "happy hour". Arrive around 11 am, before the locals get there for lunch, when lines for the food booths get very long; however, the lines are also a very good indicator of where to find the best food! Spend the afternoon in the area (perhaps Vinopolis or Beer Warf) and then stop by the local pubs for a pint or two before getting on the Tube. The pubs start to get busy by 4:00 pm.||October 8, 2009
dannsing||40||I read about this market in one of my books, but we weren't going to stop by intentionally because it was not necessarily near any of the attractions we wanted to see. However, we ended up taking a good walk from the Tower Bridge to the Millennium Bridge and stumbled upon the market. We saw a lot of great foods from different cuisines and got to sample spices and cheeses. The only thing we were able to buy was some Turkish Delight which was tasty and sweet with different fruit flavors. If you're going to cook and need some ingredients, this would be a place to stop by.||September 26, 2009

bishffc||50||We went on a Friday and enjoyed it so much, we just had to return again on the Saturday and as we were staying in the nearby London Bridge Hotel and it was just two minutes from the front door, we just had to enjoy again. It is like the best farmers market you have ever been too and then some. It is so close to many of the local tourist attractions that this is a must do side show if you are in the area. It is only a few minutes from the London Dungeon and the tourist bus stops and is open Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Come and enjoy and whilst here, do pop in to the Market Porter to sample a real London "Boozer". Warm, friendly and welcoming and a plesant change from the tourist pubs that lack atmosphere and heart. This is a good way to spend a couple of hours. Not just the pub, the market as well!||July 26, 2009
bugbyte88||50||A great selection of all kinds of foods, with tons of samples! Great for lunch or picking up unique souvenirs of olive oil, jam or preserves. I will definitely be returning every time I visit London!||July 24, 2009
ArchitectAylesbury||50||Most times when i'm in London, I try to get down to The Boro' just for the visual and sensory pleasures. You can buy some very strange food there. Had ostrich steaks once. Interesting flavour and very fat free.There is also a good wine and beer stall which does an amazing variety of foreign beers. After you have indulged your senses, I would recommend you repair to The Market Porter for proper English beer in a real pub.||July 22, 2009
moac4||50||Fabulous, lively market. A great place to pick up lunch or snacks to take to a play at the Globe. Also just a great place to shop for produce, fish, bread and meat - a really wonderful selection of vendors- I highly recommend it just for the experience.||June 20, 2009
TomDelane||40||Really enjoyed the market. A great variety of foods and a charming atmosphere.||May 4, 2009
UTDBOY||50||Although it`s actually a while since I lasted visited the market I can still remember the day well. This place really will really stimulate your senses. Everything is brilliantly displayed with the quality of Produce in particular being outstanding. Most stallholders will also let you sample their wares. If you are into cooking going to one of the fish stalls is worthwhile as they give you some great hints and tips.Unlike many other places in London you can be sure of a great lunch Borough Market also attracts some slightly more unusual stalls. Utobeer, for example, have a stall here and sell a fantastic range of real ales and stouts. There is also a stall there that sells just olives.A trip to Borough Market can be easily combined with any number of other sightseeing opportunities - The River Thames is within striking distance.||February 23, 2009
metropolis57||50||The only thing that I didn't like about the famous Borough Market was the multitude of rude tourists taking pictures of everything. Everything else was perfect: the atmosphere, the smells, the colours and the wonderful food from all around the world. And don't forget to try the lamb burger, it's terrific!||February 4, 2009
Chino1||50||If you like food, you have to come here! Even if you don't want to buy anything, you can still try almost everything there is on offer from cheese to chocolates. Had the best creme caramel ever here and tried some fantastic parmesan. Stalls are varied and everything is delicious! Worth going early as it gets super busy on Saturdays around lunch time.||December 3, 2008
Seabird0037||50||The market opens at 9am on a Saturday so we were there for opening time and made straight for Maria's Market Cafe for a brilliant and very reasonable cooked breakfast. Suitably fortified we then strolled round the market for an hour or so. The traders were very happy to offer samples. Some of the speciality food was a bit pricey but there was plenty to snack on while we walked and the atmosphere was great. It did get busy later so it paid to get there early. Most of the market is under cover which helped as it was raining. One tip - download a map before you go from www.boroughmarket.org.uk. That way you won't miss anything.||November 20, 2008
SW19Traveller||50||This isn't so much of a travel tip because my office is actually next door to Borough Market so I get to visit it almost every day, but I wanted to say that if you are visiting London, it is well worth including on the itinerary for a Friday or Saturday (when it's open). The range of very high quality food, often sold by the producer is phenomenal. The buzz in the streets round the market just makes for a great atmosphere.Also, DO NOT miss Neal's Yard Dairy in a side street next the market. This is open every day and is quite simply the best cheese shop in London. It has a fabulous range of British and Irish cheeses that can rival anything the French can come up with. The staff are all quite or very knowledgeable about their produce and will insist you try before buying. A very enjoyable experience.||August 29, 2008
Chuck539||50||For those of us who appreciate a wide variety of foods, there is no better way to spend a few hours than strolling the Borough Market. The stunning arrays of fruits, vegetables and cheeses gets your mouth watering and then you are assaulting by the amazing aromas coming from the breads, quiches, soups and sandwiches many vendors have to offer. The market is open Thursday, Friday and Saturday and is easy to reach. It is adjacent to the London Bridge tube station and just a two minute walk from London Bridge itself. It is a worthwhile retreat from the sightseeing and museums. Although it can get quite crowded, I find a little shopping and then finding refuge on the lawn at Southwark Cathedral next door to enjoy your purchases to be a wonderful experience.||August 23, 2008
PhotosInaJar||40||After reading reviews of the market and being a huge fan of anything "market" I had to make this a stop. Mark and I headed out on a Thursday in the afternoon so we were able to catch a late lunch at the Market Porter (vegetarian options available). They also obtain most of their ingredients from the market.After lunch we browsed more of the market and had some gelato and truffles. Everything is so fresh from flowers to produce and meats. Great to catch and if your up to it walk a ways to the London and Tower bridges!||August 8, 2008
prc73||50||Possibly Borough Market is my favorite gourmet pick in London. The best ones are the olives and artichoke hearts, simply fantastic. Whatsmore, on many stands they´ll give you tasters of whatever they´re selling. Even though many are saying that it´s open only on Fridays and Sats, I´ve just returned from London and I went to the market 3 times: on Thu, Fri and Sat. Maybe a local can bring us more information on this.||July 1, 2008
chrischamb||50||Easy to find get off at London Bridge and go down steps by Southwalk Cathedral and its amazing find. Only small but packed to brim with different fresh produce, from variety of countries including home grown. We got there Saturday afternoon and packed. Lots of stalls offering hot foods and we decided to have our lunch there eating out side the cathedral. Great food and atmosphere.||May 26, 2008
Adele G||50||Each trip I take to London involves visiting Borough Markets whenever I can! I love my food and this is the place to go to if so.Fascinating array of food and enticingly laid out!Do not miss......- Chorizo Stand- Pork Pies- Hot Chocolate across the RoadMake a trip down, it is most certainly well worth a visit and I can't wait to go back there again!||January 14, 2008
CristinaO||50||I adore Borough Market. This was my first London experience..coming straight from the airport, we just got off the tube at "London Bridge" station, tired and having jet lag. We had no idea where we were..we just started walking into the market..and VOILA ! Refreshed, awed, shocked, amazed. It was Friday morning and there were sausages and pates and cheese everywhere! And people offered us sample after sample. The paradise for the gourmands, for food-lovers everywhere.The market is a rainbow of smells, sights and colors. We saw rabbit, deer, sushi, sea food...everything! So colorful!But the BEST part -the Market Porter Pub which is close to the market (or part of it?). Fri at noon, hundreds of people in business attire were standing in front of the pub (not inside) with pints of beer in hand. This was lunch hour at Borough Market. Who wouldn't fall in love with the place...We came back 2 more times, first on Fri night, just after closing time..watching huge Bristish boys take down the displays and then ending up in the pubs, on the streets (again hundreds of drunk people)...second on Sun morning (but there was nothing -the market was closed). If Zola described the French Les Halles in his books (as you know, they're not as in the books anymore)..I believe it;s Borough market that made me understand what he meant. This must have been the atmosphere. Go there..||November 8, 2007
cynbook||50||For a delightful change of pace from the museums and galleries of London, you must take time on a Saturday morning to make a visit to Borough Market. So much to see and sample. It is not easy to decide from among the many, wonderful choices, but do pick a few items to make up a tasty lunch. Or just wander through and enjoy the atmosphere. And then check out the next door Southwark Cathedral for a few minutes of real peace and serenity.||October 16, 2007
Carson10||50||I love Borough Market on a Saturday. True, it can get busy and the food is quite pricey, but it's a great way to while away a morning. There are lots of samples on offer (try the Green Market for this) and you can't beat eating a freshly made lunch on the grass outside of Southwark Cathedral. There are also a huge amount of other things to see in the area so you can easily spend the whole day wandering. For a more detailed review - check out [--].||August 29, 2007
TripBlazer||20||I spent an hour or two at the Borough Market, mostly searching for the main market itself -- before I realized that the few stalls and booths I saw were all that I was going to find. I couldn't believe how few vendors were present and how limited was the selection of foods and restaurants in the area. A small group of vendors clustered together under a bridge, with a few nearby, touristy restaurants. That's it. Not worth a special trip across the Thames.||June 5, 2007
Semiquaver||50||If you like top quality food and drink, and eating on the hoof then you must visit this place. It is absolutley fantastic. But don't eat before you go, make sure you are very hungry.Don't forget only open Fridays and Saturdays.||March 5, 2007
madauntykell||50||If you get to the Tower on a Friday and you have some time, walk acorss the Bridge to the South side (opposite from the Tower of London side) for lunch. On the right hand side of the road down a small side street you will find the most amazing food market which opens up with all sorts of cuisine. They cook their wares for you so that you can try them. It's Fabulous! If I'm planning a trip to London I will always do it on a Friday!! It's called Borough Market. Bon Apetit!||October 6, 2006
perthgal||30||I had a look around on a Saturday and it was very busy! It was a good seeing all the different stalls but the Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne is better (I think). Have a peek, but its pricy so go to M&S for your fruit and vegies||July 10, 2006
IowaLad||30||Open on Fridays and Saturdays. Wander down and get your fixins for a picnic lunch. Incorporate the other Southwark/Borough sites and you have a nice day.Two excellents pubs near the market - the Market Porter and the Wheatsheaf.||January 20, 2006
