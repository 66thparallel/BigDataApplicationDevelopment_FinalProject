Great open spaces and helps you escape away from the city rush. Good on London for protecting and providing these large greenscape areas in this fun city of London||August 7, 2019
Felipe7santana||50||I went there for a walk, it’s a really nice place to do picnic, walking, running, play football with friends. It has a cafe restaurant that calls serpentine bar & kitchen. They make amazing pizzas and serving really good coffee.||August 7, 2019
ayRicardo||50||The park was nice and well maintained. I wasn’t able to explore all of the park as it is large but the area I walked through was beautiful.||August 7, 2019
MuslehS||50||Hyde Park is fabulous park with nice green, gardens and lake. It is the best to walk, play, or just set down on grass and enjoy time. The lake has a lot of activities such as paddling boats, or feeding ducks. The children have fun and great playing time. There are many lay back chairs all around the park. Just be aware that when you set down a staff will approach you and ask you to pay £1.80 per chair. Just do not mess London parks if you like walking and green and Hyde Park in particular. ||August 7, 2019
ElisaMaza1994||40||Hyde Park is huge but they have maps everywhere. Rent a bike with your smart phone or a kayak for the lake. They have cafes. No free bathrooms you have to pay so be prepared. There are several monuments and statutes to see. It's close to some of the museums so maybe visit the park before they open (at 10:00 AM). ||August 7, 2019
GarnDeb||50||This is a large and beautiful park to spend time walking through or sitting and reflecting. It has a peaceful and serene feeling and is just a lovely setting right in the middle of London!||August 7, 2019

Nan K||50||Each summer a different, internationally important architect is invited to showcase their ideas of a covered, but open space, which interacts with the landscape. This year the roof shape looks like an eagles wing...aerial and dynamic...but surprisingly made of heavy slate slabs. Entry is free and refreshments are available||August 7, 2019
trishaclay_fox||40||Wonderful park to visit, have a walk, and relax. There are some concessions available, but in our brief walk, we did not find toilets. ||August 7, 2019
ByeByeMissAmericanPi||50||This is a popular place for locals too. We had a picnic under a big shady tree. The gardens are lovely too. A nice place to sit down and have a bit of a rest.||August 7, 2019
Waggy1610||50||We circumnavigated this park by foot, starting in Knightsbridge and ending on Oxford road. What an oasis in the middle of the bustling city. Plenty of opportunity to enjoy the greenery, catch up on sleep or enjoy a fantastic coffee in a green green paradise. A welcome respite from a busy city, allow a few hours to really enjoy it if the weather is good. ||August 7, 2019
MariaCon||50||If you are visiting London then you should go and walk in Hyde park. We visited the park during Christmas time and went to the Christmas wonderland as well. Definitely going back!||August 7, 2019
TonyB5263||50||Plenty to do and see. Open green space with excellent dedicated cycle track. There are a number of permanent venues throughout the park and it's used for numerous other events throughout the year. Very well maintained and clean||August 7, 2019
Heather B||50||Hadn't been here for many many years. Beautifully maintained with large areas left wild for grass to grow and areas planted with wildflowers. Busy in the summer but still able to feel the peace of a beautiful garden. Deck chairs laid out for hire and boats available. Had coffee by the lakeside and watched the birds. An amazing place to relax and unwind.||August 7, 2019
v k||40||This is a great place that can be visited any number of times and there is always something for everyone. It is especially nice to visit in the summer as the park, lake, boating, Diana memorial fountain and play area are loved by kids. The cafe offers a nice place to sit and relax with a lovely view. Alternatively bring a picnic and find your spot....even on a busy day there is enough space for everyone.||August 6, 2019
Jennifer R||50||A very pleasant morning walk across the park to Exhibition Road. Lots of locals and dogs taking the cool morning air before the heat built up during the recent heat wave.||August 6, 2019
Rambabu M||50||I recommend everyone to visit Hyde park and its attractions. It is huge, but well maintained. You can see flower gardens, ponds, ducks and statues of historical importance. Ideally you can spend 3 hours, if you wish to cover by walking.||August 6, 2019
LATraveller_12||50||We did not get to see the Speaker's Corner, but what we were able to see was enough to say "This is great! Finally, a relaxing place in London". During a 3 day stay in London, we have been here twice, we considered it was well worth to visit different parts of the park. We loved the shaded alleys, the lake and the cafes along it. Wonderful!||August 6, 2019
Jane G||50||Take a long, slow walk through Hyde Park and enjoy the scenery, the people, the gardens and the birds.||August 6, 2019

vgdor||40||It is an excellent place for a long walk, play with the kids and see some royal places of interest. The lake with swans, the birds, the beautiful garden of Kensington Palace||August 6, 2019
Richmondie||50||I love London's great parks. They can absorb crowds of people, who come there to picnic, stroll about or hang out with their kids. People of all sorts come. Nobody bothers anybody. Ignore those who tell you that central London is a "no-go zone". There are no no-go zones in London. Please visit! This is one of the most diverse cities in the world, and we all get along fine.||August 6, 2019
itslindaw||50||A lovely park to walk around. Love to see the wild animals around here. There is plenty of places to sit on and also places to get some fast food and ice cream!||August 6, 2019
HappyGirlNI||50||Wow Wow and Wow again. Amazing atmosphere, well organised and an event which I’ll remember for the rest of my life. Celine Dion, Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder & Barbra Streisand to name just a few artists. Feeling so privileged to have spent 3 wonderful days in this beautiful park.||August 5, 2019

misso838||50||Beautiful clean park. Visited the Diana memorial garden with water feature that kids and adults could walk through ( not officially, but everyone was). Everyone was having fun and helping each other around the feature. Great family day out.||August 5, 2019
Jonathan W||40||Busy!! I’ve never seen so many people in Hyde Park on a Saturday afternoon when there’s no concert/event on. We went for a leisurely stroll. Queue for the boats on The Serpentine was ridiculous. Restaurants & Kiosks all very busy.It’s a shame cyclists don’t stick to the clearing marked cycle lanes, rather than zooming in & out of the pedestrian pathways.||August 4, 2019
Rawia H||50||Took a soothing rowing boat ride in the lake. Weather was amazing. Lines were reasonable and there’s help and assistance everywhere. Wonderful experience with swans and ducks and other types of friendly birds makes it a memorable one. ||August 4, 2019
Brian W||50||Stayed in a hotel just outside of Hyde Park. Went for a run on almost daily basis in the park. Mornings before 8 is when the park is mainly populated by runners and the workers preparing the park for a new day. Later in the day when it is nice the park is very popular with everyone so it gets a bit crowded. Kensington Palace is located in the west end of the park. The Serpentine with a beach, fountain for the kids to play in, paddle boats, and a snack bar is located in the middle of the park.||August 4, 2019
alvaroacc||50||Well preserved, I went early morning as I am a jogger. Nice park within the city. Well preserved, different activities & thinks to do, see & visit. Then a must in your trip. A walk or a run through it give you peace. When in LOndon read about it to maximized your visitDont missit!!||August 4, 2019
stephjmc||50||We randomly wandered into Hyde Park during our week visiting London. This ended up being one of our favorite outings! It’s absolutely gorgeous, and a stroll through the park included a cute cafe, lovely flowers, and many friendly little animals (who were not people shy!) coming to visit us on our walk. ||August 4, 2019
ShelleyKulle||50||Nice place to take a walk, there was an outdoor concert series happening in July while we were there. There are lawn chairs you can rent by the half hour/hour to sit and take a rest. Lots of park benches as well near the water. Restaurant, ice cream shop are also near the water. Be careful of the bird poop - don't walk or sit under the trees! We saw a lot of people get hit with bird poop. Lots of gardens within Hyde Park and spots to walk around. It's about an hour's walk from Buckingham Palace, through Hyde Park to the other end of the Park.||August 3, 2019
Kelvin L||40||We spent a short time walking through the park, and really did not spend as much time as we probably should have in this iconic area. What we did see was great, with wildlife galore and plenty to see and do. A must do while in London. ||August 3, 2019
steph-a-r00||50||Gorgeous surroundings, lively atmosphere, birds, butterflies, and boating. A sublime oasis. Highly recommended.||August 3, 2019
Tori H||40||We enjoyed wandering through the park from Kensington Palace to the Hard Rock Cafe. It's lovely to have so many green spaces in the middle of such a busy city, passing so many iconic & historical monuments & buildings along the way. A lovely peaceful way to get some photos of must-see places.||August 3, 2019
Davistravels||50||It is a great way to relax and enjoy the walk, the swans, ducks and pigeons added to the atmosphere. It is so nice to have a green space in the middle of London. It seems like you're in the country. Great walk from Buckingham Palace to Kensington Palace.We enjoyed the rose garden which was in full bloom. ||August 2, 2019
l0ttiee1||50||Hired the TFL bikes and biked around the parks which was great in itself, but then decided to hire out one of the pedal boats on the serpentine. The boat was great fun and we thought it was quite reasonably priced for how long we got (approx £10 each an hour) but was a lot more tiring than anticipated! Great place to visit on a sunny day with lovely views of nature and things to do.||August 2, 2019
daryaalaska||40||Lots of sporting activities. Nice walks.Flora and fauna. Lovely meadow. Native plants with butterflies. Birds and water fowl. ||August 2, 2019

artdob||50||We walked quite a lot of this magnificent park. Plenty of walking paths to get in some good exercise or a simple stroll. We took cover at one point under a large tree which served as a natural umbrella as a moment of rain passed over the park. Coming through on the South Kensington side, we were awed by the magnificent Prince Albert statue. We explored other areas of the park including the Princess Diana fountain and walkway, Italian Garden and water side areas. A highly recommended visit during time in London.||July 31, 2019
Jnine N||50||A large park that is ideal for a stroll, picnic or rollerblade. I don't think they allow riding your bike inside but it's great around the parameter.||July 31, 2019

MyLittleVoyage||50||The whispers in the morning, and an early morning it was. Setting off at 7am, I eagerly headed to the capital for what was sure to be a fantastic show that evening. Celine Dion, in Hyde Park. How special! Performing as part of the British Summer Time event, Celine was the headline act of the day, following on from Claire Richards and Josh Groban. This really was going to be a good day.ArrivalBritish Summer Time takes place in Hyde Park each year, and is a brilliant location within the city of London. There is plenty of space, and great travel connections to anywhere in the UK, thanks to the TFL network, making this one of the most accessible events the capital hosts.Arriving at Marble Arch Tube Station, it was a short five minute walk across the top corner of Hyde Park to the entrance. There was no chance of getting lost, as there was plenty of signage along the route. With ticket in hand, I headed through the security and baggage check, which was handled thoroughly, something I appreciate in this current climate. They were checking each pocket within my bag, and being extra thorough – props to the security team for keeping on top of their game and taking things seriously. I breezed through the entrance, and into the festival site.The FestivalUnlike any other event I’ve attended in the past, Barclaycard Presents British Summer Time was a festival like no other. Taking place over a couple of weeks, this was a day festival in the sense that there is no camping or overnight provisions, and you pay per day you wish to attend. There is, however, everything else a traditional British festival has to offer – tasty street food, promotional stands, prizes, games, rides and merchandise, and much more. It was clear as you entered the park that this was a place to spend the afternoon before the headline act – something I planned to do.To the right of the entrance was a Tinder stand, that looked as though it was a touring bar(?). As I waited for my friends later in the evening, I observed a lot of people laugh and point when they spotted it immediately after entering the event. It really was an odd sight to behold, but alas, it looked as though it may have been fun for those that made their way over to it. Drinks in the sun are fun, after all.To the left, there was what at first glance looked like a permanent building housing a large and sprawling bar. As I got closer, I realized it wasn’t a real building, but a temporary event building, heavily themed! I was impressed at the levels of effort put into this event already – this was a welcome change from the standard festival experience where the bars are inside standard marquee tents.Lots of food stalls took residence in the central area, with back to back stalls running directly down the middle of the site. With a plethora of food options available, including Pizza, Kebabs, Burgers, Curry and more, I opted for something I’d seen online in previous event reviews – a Hot Scotch Egg – specifically the Chorizo variety. Priced reasonably (for a Central London event), I found a nice spot in front of the Old Oak (main) Stage, and dug in, whilst listening to Claire Richards – a brilliant performance by her, in which she sang some new and old stuff.The merchandise stall had a variety of Celine related merch, and also some BST additions too. I grabbed a Pin Badge and Lanyard and was impressed at the reasonable price for an event, as these make perfect mementos to remember the day! I also won a Coke tote bag in a recycling challenge – fun!I settled down and relaxed for a couple of hours whilst I waited for my friends to arrive, and took in the various different artists that put on a show during the afternoon. The sun was shining, the crowd was forming, and the artists were entertaining. What more could I ask for?The ShowWow. Just… Wow. I was expecting a performance and a half, but Celine blew all my expectations. Taking to the stage at 20:20 with one of her most powerful hits, The Power of Love, the crowd were instantly captivated by her aura and charm. Sounding exactly the same as her recorded music, she flowed into That’s the Way it Is and I’m Alive, giving one hell of a performance. Her power was astounding, and the way her voice connected with the crowd was something special that cannot be described. She interspersed her greatest hits with personality, charm and whit, cracking jokes and sharing some special memories and moments.Because You Loved Me, It’s All Coming Back to Me Now and (a personal highlight), Beauty and the Beast followed, in a nice reflective part of the show. The energy shifted slightly but the adoring fans went with it, and sang along, word for word. Nicely leading into The Reason and her all-French lyric hit Pour que tu m’aimes encore, of which a lot of the crowd knew all of the lyrics to and sang along in a powerful moment. This was a testament to the amazing success of Celine Dion and her loving fans – not many artists have such a fanbase that would be able to sing along to a non-native-tongue language track, but this crowd was full of people able to do just that. How wonderful!Celine spoke fondly of a story about when Ryan Reynolds made contact with her about the film Deadpool 2, which she performed the soundtrack for with Ashes. Hearing her stories and the way she made herself so relatable to all of us really made us feel like we were there not only to watch Celine, but to be there WITH Celine. Flying On my Own followed on nicely, keeping the same vibe, but the biggest surprise (for me) came in the next song. – Think Twice. I have never experienced such a moment at a concert before, and this really blew me away. This is getting serious….The song started as normal, in exactly the same way as you’d expect. The crowd were singing along, and as it’s not a particularly lively song for the first 50%, it was a nice singalong track. As the song picked up momentum, however, so did the fans. At roughly the 75% mark, the crowd LOST it, and absolutely BELTED out the lyrics. I was not prepared for the level and power of 60,000 singing fans all in absolute sync and unity for the most explosive part of the song. It really was a shocking and brilliant moment that I managed to capture a short snippet of – but the video does not do it justice. You had to be present to feel the absolute power of Think Twice.Taking the emotional route, Celine delivered a mellow but touching All By Myself, but similar to Think Twice, the power comes towards the end of the song, and once again the crowd had her back, belting out arguably one of her biggest and most well known hits. Everyone was singing along, and for those three short minutes we actually felt something special. It’s incredibly hard to articulate into words.Uptown Funk and Purple Rain were a surprise addition during the Interlude, which kept the crowd in high spirits. River Deep Mountain High and Love Can Move Mountains came afterwards, in a lovely and enjoyable segment of the show that can’t be forgotten. The best, however, was just around the corner, and we all knew what was coming.My Heart Will Go OnWe were all waiting for this moment. That song. That time. Everyone knew it was coming, and there was no other place for My Heart Will Go On but the finale of the show. I, however, was not quite prepared for what Celine gave to us.She entered the stage in the middle, and walked towards the crowd, stopping at the halfway point. In a dazzling Golden dress, she sang those famous opening lyrics and the crowd was instantly captivated. I was in absolute awe that I was lucky enough to see Celine Dion sing arguably her most famous and well known hits, right here in Hyde Park. As she made it to the chorus, absolutely EVERYONE was on their feet and singing every last word, in unison. I’ve never, ever experienced such a powerful thing in my entire life. We were all there, present for the same amazing moment, sharing something we will never share again. Celine delivered a simply divine and opulent performance, and the crowd were here for it. Throughout the entire song, she never missed a beat and we were all providing her backing vocals for every word.In a surprise move, Celine followed this powerful song with a short message about love and unity, leading perfectly into a really moving rendition of Imagine by John Lennon. As soon as those first notes were played, the entire atmosphere changed. If the crowd felt completely connected for her previous song, then we were now bonded like Super Glue. For those three minutes, I felt as though everything in the world was unified. Imagine all the people, living for today. I felt incredibly emotional from the moment I heard the song start, and was in tears throughout; this to me was incredibly moving, powerful and emotional. Hearing Celine perform this made me listen to every single word. With the crowd singing along, there was no screaming, no shouting, and no talking. It was such a mellow moment that really made me reflect on a lot of things. It reminded me of my father whom I lost at the beginning of the year, so the emotions and tears came flooding. It was an absolutely beautiful performance, and one I will never, ever forget.End of ShowCeline ended the show by declaring her love (again) for London, and the crowd cheered and whooped along. I turned to my friends and we all agreed how much of an amazing show it had been. I never expected to feel anything close to what I did throughout that night, and words cannot begin to describe just how I felt. Seeing Celine was a privilege, and an evening I will never forget.As we were leaving Hyde Park, the crowds were incredibly heavy as you’d expect. However, despite the show ending, we weren’t ready for bed just yet! Every so often someone would start singing one of Celine’s hits, and everyone’d join in the singing as we plodded on towards the Tube Stations. Once again, I was unprepared for such a brilliant spectacle, and this made me feel many happy things. It showed and proved just how much Celine is respected and loved worldwide. There are many videos online of fans singing as they entered the stations and even on the trains, and it really does show just how much of an impact her songs have on the world. Wonderful to see, and incredible to experience firsthand. When you bless the day, I just drift away, all my worries die, I’m glad that I’m Alive.||July 30, 2019

Paul P||50||The parks of London are superb and Hyde Park was no exception. A bit of it was closed off for their regular summer concert but the place is huge and there is so much area to enjoy. It was particularly special for me as I dropped my mobile phone and the finder a wonderful French lady tracked me down and returned it. The Serpentine is particularly a great place to laze and enjoy the sun - yes they do have some sometimes.||July 29, 2019

Brian G||50||A walk through Hyde Park is a must on a Sunday morning, You will never believe that you are in the centre of London. The quietness, other than a few joggers, and squirrels darting up the trees. London is so lucky to have such a wide expanse of greenery for every-one to enjoy.||July 29, 2019

M-1950-R||50||Nothing drains me more than just standing around, so I need a good walk to get going in the morning. Because we were staying across the street from the park, we got up several mornings and took off across the park just for fun. There is no bad way to go!||July 27, 2019
ste141||40||I wanted to do something that I'd never done before and I found Hyde Park had a lido and I could swim or not swim there all day for £4.80p. I took the tube to Hyde Park Corner and took a slow walk, as it was a very hot day. I found it to be very peaceful, as I walked along, and I could see people in their pedalo boats. When I arrived, there was a small queue, mainly people with their children. I went in, paid and then went to a changing room which had two changing room cubicles and three toilets (one being broken). I was then able to put my belongings into a locker, though I had to pay £1 for it and take the key out and put it around my wrist. I followed some people out and had to walk to a mat which was next to a silver plated thing to hold onto. There was a lifeguard there and he seemed to be very good at his job, as anyone who didn't use the mat, got told off straight away. Though it was a very hot day, there were hardly anyone swimming. I swam the length of the lido and found another lifeguard there. I thought the price was reasonable and would recommend anyone who is thinking of going for a swim on a hot day. I don't know how long I spent in the water, but there was plenty of space for me as its 30m width wise and 100m lengthwise. Also, I was able to swim near the swans which were on the other side of the barrier and they didn't at all fazed by anyone. There was a lot of seaweed below the water, but most of it was mainly sand and pebbles.||July 27, 2019
staceyjeen||50||This park is a tranquil oasis in a very busy city. The Serpentine is a lovely place to sit around & have lunch or take a boat ride. Families & couples were out in force on a very hot sunny day.Lots of places to eat & drink although on the day we visited there was a burst water main somewhere which meant we could not get a meal in the restaurants so had to settle for sandwiches. Not a problem as there were lots of seats & some shade from trees. The Princess Diana memorial was lovely, full of children enjoying the water. Perfect place to unwind when rushing around seeing the sights of London.||July 26, 2019

Nidgehammer||50||We went down to see Stevie Wonder at BST this year and took the opportunity to have a walk around this magnificent park both before and after the gig. It’s been years since we actually entered the park on foot although have driven through a few times.The trees are huge, the paths are wide and the Serpentine is lovely to walk around on a warm summer afternoon. We probably covered about 5% but still seemed to walk for miles, not to be missed if you’re spending a few days in London this summer. ||July 24, 2019
Momnipresent||40||We walked up to Hyde Park to visit Kensington Palace. After strolling through the gardens, we walked back through the park itself. The paths are large and very accessible. There are places to get drinks and ice cream, and even places to rent bikes. Much of the grounds have been naturalized and have very few formalized gardens.||July 24, 2019
Helen B||50||What a glorious park. All the very big trees, chestnuts all in bloom. Swans were enormous!! And excited to see the dead trees being replace all through the park. Must see! Cafe expensive, and underwhelming. However the park was superb!||July 24, 2019
Roger S||50||Usually we walk around the southern end of Hyde Park, but last week we visited the northern end of the Serpentine for the first time.Lovely cafe serving great coffee, and the views over the Italian Sunken Gardens were beautiful. 200-300 m east of there is the Allotment Garden Society - quite small but very well laid out and interesting||July 24, 2019
megmullineaux||50||We walked Hyde Park on a drizzly day and we still had a lovely time! There is lots of great things to see, playgrounds nearby for the kids, and concessions. We stopped at the Peter Pan statue, the Princess Diana memorial, and the Princess Diana playground with our kid and had a lovely day.||July 24, 2019
roo263||40||These parks are great for you to lose yourself in for a few hours and slow down a bit from the manic speed of life which London seems to have.There is also a lovely little cafe and bathroom facilities. Not sure how to describe it, but there is a place in the park where you can stand and see a stunning view over the bridge of iconic London buildings. Def worth a visit, even if its just to walk through on your way somewhere. ||July 24, 2019
CuteHugh||30||A great park, historical too but there need to be more food and toilet facilities. Then again, increasing these could result in more litter?||July 24, 2019
devilsdr||50||Hyde Park has a holy place in my heart. Whenever in London, I visit it as a ritual. The park has a personality of its own. Think of perfect atmosphere, serenity, peace, beauty, nature and fun, multiply it with infinity and you have London Hyde Park. I fell in eternal love with the park at first site and have a soulful attachment with the place.A huge park to take stroll or for biking, in rainy weather or sunshine, no moment in Hyde Park is dull. Be it feeding the ducks, geese and parrots or just sitting in the lush grass, its an intensely mesmerizing immersive experience. With so much people visiting Hyde Park daily, its still highly tidy and clean always. The free to enter park is open from 5am to 12am but the best time to visit is sunset when the beauty and gorgeousness of the park is at its prime. Access is very easy via tube through Knightsbridge Station or by buses. For those coming by car, there is paid Pay and Display parking for 2.40£/hour from Monday to Saturday and for 1.40£/hour on Sundays and Public Holidays but Parking spaces are quite limited, even the Royal Parks who manage the park don't recommend to visit the park via cars.It's recommended to bring something to eat, otherwise there are few cafes and stalls in the park. My favorite is the Lido Bar. Don't forget to visit the atmospheric Diana Memorial Fountain and Rose Garden.I loudly and energetically recommend this park to anyone visiting London even if you are not into Parks and such activities. It will surprise you with its beauty so much, you will fall in love instantly like I did with this magical place.||July 23, 2019
abigaill581||50||We spent part of an afternoon here and it was just lovely. It was late spring and the flowers were all on bloom and it was so fragrant and pretty. Our kids had fun running around and blowing off some steam. ||July 23, 2019
487leonk||50||Great open space to enjoy a social drink with friends on the grass and if your lucky you get to enjoy great music from the many concerts on over the summer so you get free entertainment outside the concert area :) lots of things to do if you want as it has a lake and many gardens and places to grab a coffee, it even has deck chairs to sit on however I think it £5 for an hour but overall great fun. ||July 23, 2019
LordAppetiser||50||What a treasure this park is, it is a place of life and soul, always busy with people and events and just as a place to relax and avoid the traffic and hustle bustle of the city. Always a pleasure and worth the effort every time. Looking forward to being back again in September.||July 23, 2019
Grecophile2019||50||I enjoyed a stroll across Hyde Park on a Saturday morning whilst I was on a day trip to London. Very nice to walk across whilst it was quiet on a Saturday morning. Well worth a visit. ||July 22, 2019
alhlstnam||40||I especially wanted to go to see Speakers Corner, with the possibility of being a brief heckler. Went during a weekday, and discovered there are only speakers on a weekend, The corner looked pretty overgrown suggesting that it's fallen into disuse. Maybe the internet has offered an easier forum. Many other locations in this huge and beautiful park; worth a stroll for anyone. Unfortunately, there was going to be a concert and much of the park was taken up with the stands and related structures, and took away from this peaceful park.||July 22, 2019
MGBGlobe||50||Take a morning or afternoon and allow yourself to stumble upon the various parts of this park- you won't regret it! I had no plans and walked through the park with a delight at every corner. The rest of my review has spoilers, but I highly recommend discovering it on your own. I thoroughly enjoyed walking through Hyde Park. It is clean and open, and I loved sitting by the water and watching the ducks, geese, swans and other various birds. There is a little cafe by the water that wasn't too crowded, so I grabbed a pizza and a cappuccino. I didn't get to do this, but I think riding a bike would be fairly easy (with one of those bike share stations on almost every corner) and enjoyable to do in the park. I allowed myself to wander through the park as I had a full day and I've seen most of the classic London highlights already. I stumbled upon the gorgeous rose garden, the lake with swans and other birds, the Diana Memorial Fountain was fun to stick my tired feed into the cold water, and Kensington Palace. It was so enjoyable to just discover the different aspects of this park without having a plan. ||July 22, 2019
Mobile293759||50||On a recent trip to London we came across Hyde Park and even though it was raining we decided to have a walk in this famous parkWe were not disappointed once into the park it was so peaceful the water gardens were a little over run with algae but still beautiful with lovely white water lilies just opening The amount of birds on the lake and in the park and the variety was pleasing and the facilities we saw ie cafes toilets and information posts was good To say the least we enjoyed our walk in the rain and intend to come back on a nice day and bring a picnic ||July 22, 2019

FayeInAmsterdam||40||So nice to see people running in the park and also schools use this park to do sports. It’s so big. Almost a “mini forest”. I love the small buildings. Private I suppose. ||July 22, 2019

Frank7777777||50||I’ve been there many times, this beautiful park has many potential to every aspect.Especially for painters what’s to creat a lovely picture and moments.People are walking around and have some foods around lake area, you could also hire canoe or pedals boat while you are there.||July 21, 2019

StevenT1602||50||Hyde park seems to have it all, but just to walk through the park in peace and quiet has to be the best way to enjoy. Although there are lakes and on many occasions entertainment, just take a stroll and take it all in.||July 21, 2019
Hongkongboy55||40||Yes, a park but a famous one. Well worth to pay a visit to this park. We entered the park from one end and then walked thru it before leaving at other end under excellent weather. Taken some pictures when walking along.||July 21, 2019

Shod47||50||We visited London on a hot, humid day, and Hyde Park provided much needed shade and sensory relief. It is a great place to get your bearings before heading back to the tourist attractions.||July 20, 2019
Moetbubbles||50||We stayed just across the road from this wonderful park so it was easily accessible, on finding our way to the area for the BST concert we walked through various areas ranging from woodlands to lakes and a lido, to the speakers corner and Diana's Memorial, i never realized just how huge this park is, its a fabulous area for anyone seeking a little peace and tranquility from the hustle and bustle of London, we didn't have time to see it all unfortunately but i'm sure we will one day, however they do host a magnificent Concert.....||July 20, 2019

Trip776515||50||I always try to visit Hyde Park when I am in London. Great place for your daily exercise (running, walking, biking, yoga). Peaceful environment for a picnic under the trees or there are restaurants and outdoor cafes overlooking the Serpentine. There is even a swimming pool.||July 18, 2019
Z2391UTjamess||50||Wandering through this green & pleasant space in the centre of the bustling city, it is easy to forget for a moment the hubub, chaos & noise that are only yards away. It is a place that one never gets tired of visiting, even for a few short monents, truely, an oasis of tranquility.||July 18, 2019

Jencheltenham||50||The best park in London by far. Just beautiful for walking, running exploring and just finding that space for yourself in the middle of London. Don't visit London and not give it a visit ||July 17, 2019
AA9391||40||Firstly you can hear the concert in the main Hyde park no need to buy a ticket! Lots of people chose to pre drink outside in Hyde park then go into the concert later on. Security was the best and I forgot to take off my jewellery watch and bracelet etc and I set the alarms off it was laughed off and I wasn’t searched. We went to the Barclaycard arena for Barclaycard holders. My aunt showed her Barclaycard and we went into the roped off area and we’re given WiFi passes. There were free ice creams which had unfortunately run out. Alcoholic Drinks were between £4&£8 dependant on choice. Most drinks were premixed or bottled. The sound system was playing up during the black eyed peas set which will.i.am apologise for, not great for a concert of this size. The areas were fenced off platinum at the front, then gold circle which you can upgrade to on the day and then general admission. By this point the front of general admission is quite far back. There were also to vip towers which blocks the view along with the speaker masts. Most general admission customers were watching on tv and sitting on picnic blankets. Large variety of food. 2 sets of toilets and the queue went rather fast but take your own toilet roll! Left just before the last song and beat some of the crowd. Very very busy. Would recommend but would probably upgrade as the general admission area is over crowded||July 17, 2019

Mislav7||50||Hyde Park was the last place we visited during our London trip and was one of the highlights for me. It's very big and very nice, perfect place to relax after visiting other attractions.Plan enough time for visit (I would recommend at least 1-2 hours) and don't hurry.||July 16, 2019
bthani||40||Lovely park but there's always food on the ground I can never take my dog off leash. Plenty to do though and it connects up to Green Park which is smaller but nicer.||July 16, 2019
927victor||50||A great place for a few hour walk. The right combination of manicured gardens and wilder spaces. And... You are never more than a few thousand yards form a cafe. ||July 16, 2019
noracassandra||50||I have heard of how big it is, but I never pictured it this huge! I loved it, every corner and every path reviles a new historical surprise. On my first visit to the Park we visited Diana's play ground. Our 4 year-old son spent over 3 hours playing without getting bored. I mean I literally had to drag him crying and bribe him with ice-cream to get out of there. I have to admit I enjoyed playing with him too. We went after to Diana's memorial and had some lovely pizzas and salads at one of the restaurant-cafes by the lake. We hand fed the squirrels with organic non-salty walnuts we were carrying as snack for ourselves. I don't usually agree with feeding wild animals because of what human food can do to them, but this time I couldn't resist the cuteness. Then the men and kids went on the peddling boat trip on the lake.For the next 5 days I visited the Park and took each day different direction, and still didn't manage to find all secrets of that huge Park. I would love to stay close to Hyde Park in every future visit to London. Oh and one more thing; my husband and daughter are Pokémon Go players and Wizards Unite players. As they explained that Hyde Park was a heaven for them. ||July 15, 2019
Ryunami||30||My schedule during my recent trip to London was packed but i managed to squeeze a few visits.The first day i arrived in London i visited the park in the very late afternoon. It was winter and almost dark but the park was full with people doing activities from jogging, walking, meeting friends and family with children. People walking their pet dogs.The next morning i came as early as 5.00am (because my official schedule started at 8.00am) but to my horror the park was too dark inside. I think i can see some male joggers along the dark paths but i decided not to enter ( i know London is safe but) and jogged along the pedestrian outside the park. It was cold and the pedestrian wasnt a nice option to my feet but at least the red double decker buses and the cars passing by give me a reassurance. The winter cold was bearable and i decided to run until i reached my hotel in Prince's Square because the streets were too quiet except for some early general workers and homeless. The next few days i still ended up running along the pedestrian.||July 15, 2019

royston33||50||We attended Hyde Park for the British summertime festival 2019 with Robbie Williams what a gig it was my 38th time of seeing Robbie and he was definitely on form. The show was very well organised the toilets were clean the cues went down very quickly lots of different bars and food areas and lots of different entertainment while waiting between the acts. However if you were in the gold circle he couldn’t really see there was two massive VIP areas down in the gold circle which blocks the view of many many fans this is a little unfair this stage didn’t seem too high so we couldn’t really see Robbie apart from on the screens. There was two main screens but that was it And as we were actually stood slightly in front of them we didn’t see hardly anything. All in all the concert was good however not sure about the venue.On entering the park we had decided we would like to do the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain it was about a mile walk into the park it was a beautiful day so we didn’t mind when we got there it’s like a lazy river myself and my friend commented on we were both a little disappointed however on reflection it was very fitting, lots of children having fun in the water and parents watching on. Lots of families were having picnics and it was just beautiful. This memorial is open at certain times on certain days very very beautiful.||July 15, 2019
RichardC19||20||Went to see Robbie Williams at Hyde Park on Sunday 14th July 2019. We'd been to many stadiums in the past but this was our first festival, so I have a few recommendations to anyone else who is going to one of these for the first time. Firstly you are limited on what you can take in, but there is one ESSENTIAL piece of equipment you need, and that is a picnic blanket. Next you need to get in as early as possible, and RUN to the Great Oak Stage. Find the nearest spot to the stage you can, avoiding the completely pointless VIP boxes, lay your blanket on the grass and stay there. Make sure someone in your party guards that spot at all times, That is your personal space. Ignore the acts at the two other stands. Then simply lay down on your blanket and wait there until the final show, at which point you roll up your blanket, and move as far as you can to the fence which borders your area from the wealthy people in front and the VIP boxes, and of course the even wealthier people in front of them. The reason why you have to do this is because everyone else will. The only other option is to stand at the back and have your view blocked by a load of waving hands and mobile phones. There are screens but they are very small. I don't understand why the VIPs need two boxes in the Gold area, they restrict everyone else's view, besides they already have a large terrace with a perfect view of the stage. Better still, wait until the performers are touring and watch them in a decent stadium, although avoid Wembley at all costs as the place is a nightmare to drive to.||July 15, 2019
Ola B||40||We went to the Stevie Wonder Song Party with Lionel Ritchie and special guests Leanne La Havanas and Corinne Bailey-Rae. what a fabulous event and a beautiful park to hold it in. The awesome really old trees in Hyde Park makes it really special place to be anyway. If you want to see some of the oldest trees in London Hyde Park is really a lovely park to go to. I just love the stature of this park. It is well tended for and cared. Visitors are getting better at cleaning up after themselves - not necessarily at a festival event, but things are getting better. There are lots of quiet spots to head towards, like the 7'7 memorial area. Lots of good conditioned benches to make use of throughout the park. My one bug bear with all our parks- is the wish that dog owners would consistently pick up after their dog fouling the parking - not all dog owners obviously, but there is a large section of the dog owning community that refuse to obey the bye-laws of our wonderful city. Luckily I never stepped in dog mess, but Hyde Park does have its typical share||July 15, 2019
Davros64||30||Firstly let me say how superb Robbie was. Amazing showman, great voice, set and stories. Loved it! Now to BST. Bought standard tickets, closest we could get to the stage was about 400 metres ( I wish I was exaggerating!). Obscene money making venture. Behind gold circle was meant to be free of blankets but was not and no one seemed that bothered about enforcing it. As a music fan I was outraged. This is a picnic area with bars and the music seemed to be a side issue. If you really want to see the bands you came for you must purchase at least gold circle to get anywhere near. Won’t be going again ||July 15, 2019

305leannea||30||Attended the Robbie Williams concert third time I’ve attended a concert here in the past couple of years . Sunday was possibly the worst one hard to walk one end of the park to the other as the walkways were blocked with people and you were literally walking over peoples picnic blankets looking for a gap or route to walk through !! The toilet situation was terrible the que was just ridiculous not enough toilets spending 20 minutes queuing, puts you off drinking. Love coming here too ||July 15, 2019
eur0traveller50||50||This enormous park has a most wonderful cosmopolitan atmosphere with several choices of eateries.A great place to relax and people watch.||July 15, 2019

SAB5859||50||While visiting London we had a walk through the park a few times and it’s a truly fabulous park to visit. The park is well maintained, has lots to see & do, has cafes & restaurants.We also went to see Robbie Williams and other performers at BST 2019 which was a fantastic event and really well run.Can’t fault Hyde Park in any way.||July 15, 2019
catd12||30||We were here recently for the Stevie Wonder gig. Stevie was fantastic but I wouldn't return to Hyde park for another gig. The grass is well worn and bare. (Do they give the area a break from concerts to let the grass regrow) The majority of people had picnic blankets with them which took up a lot of room and at a concert that had 60k plus attending there was a lot of foot traffic and navigating around the blankets was awkward and the glares from people when thousands were crossing over their blankets was not necessary as there was nothing else that could be done. The facilities were fantastic and clean. There were also lots of food and drink available but any packaging that people had from the food and drink was just thrown on the grass as there were no bins available to put the rubbish in. You randomly saw staff walking through the crowd pulling a bin bag behind them to pick up the rubbish left by the crowd but with the volumes of rubbish on the grass it didn't make any difference. We didn't go anywhere else in Hyde park so this is just a review of the area we were in. Great gig though||July 15, 2019
FourLs||20||Went to Neil Young and Bob Dylan here, great show and well organised until it came to leaving. Having been to several concerts here I had no worries until I realised we were being herded through about an 8 foot gap. As there were 65,000 people in the park it was horrendous. We were squashed, people were pushing and shoving and had it got an worse there could have been a complete disaster. I will not be going to anymore concerts here unless this issue is addressed, it was so frightening and unnecessary. Once out of the boarded area you could not get out of the park without walking a long way to again very narrow exit gates. My hotel was half a mile away at most and it took an hour to get there.||July 15, 2019
Tracey L||40||The largest park in the heart of London. Plenty to do and see for everyone. Such a lovely and historic area of the city. Plenty of pathways for pedestrians and a cycle route around the perimeter. Plenty of people enjoying walking, running, fitness classes and even roller skating lessons. Deck chairs for hire to enjoy the flora and fauna. Plenty of wildlife including birds, ducks, swans and squirrels. Princess Diana’s memorial fountains and walk is a poignant area for reflection or just to dabble toes in the water. There is a boating lake in the middle of the serpentine where you can hire a paddle boat. The famous speakers corner near Marble Arch is always a popular sight for freedom of speech. Music concerts have also taken place here for many years. ||July 15, 2019

Saija M||50||Coming to London as a tourist with small children can be quite overwhelming. Hyde Park is a fantastic haven to go to recharge. It gives you so many options for walking and still avoiding heavy traffic and a huge crowd. Walk from Marble Arch through the park to get to Notting Hill, Victoria or Kensington Stop at the fantastic Princess Diana’s Memorial Playground and let your children run freeGo for squirrel hunt throughout the park, grab some picnic food in Tesco at Queens way and enjoy it on the greensWalk along the Serpentine, watch the ducks and paddling boats, listen to a concert outside the closed off area, go to the funfair or visit Winter Wonderland.Hyde park has so many options anytime of the year and is absolute favourite spot in London for me||July 14, 2019
Tetta14||50||We were lucky, it was a beautiful warm and sunny day. London is filled with so many beautiful parks in the middle of such a congested city. I enjoy parks and taking the time to walk through them. ||July 14, 2019
devondumpling3||50||Dylan and Neil Young concert, excellent, Lucky enough to have Diamond Circle ticket which gave access to excellent VIP garden, with food and drinks at reasonable prices. Probably needed more seating in that area. Toilets were very clean and tidy even at end of evening. Only downside was immense queue for merchandise stall? By the time I reached counter I felt compelled to buy T shirt (Pricey) but Dylans about 76/77 Neil Youngs 73 and I'm approaching 70 so let's "Keep on Rocking in the Free World" and as for ticket price, you can't take it with you. So enjoy.||July 14, 2019
RazzyBthefirst||50||We were staying just off the Bayswater Road and were able to use the park as a walkway on several occasions. The paths were all well maintained and there are lanes for pedestrians, bikers etc.As there were events going on, there were barriers around but it was all well organised.It's so important to have these green spaces in big cities and we walked to Marble Arch in idyllic surroundings and a warm breeze.Just sorry we didn't start our trip on the Sunday and take in the Barbara Streisand and Bryan Ferry concert.||July 14, 2019
Hatfield_visitor||50||Lovely walk through Hyde Park. Sun out, peaceful and quiet, trees for shade, Serpentine to enjoy, deck-chairs to sit and relax in, cafes to buy drinks and snacks. Enjoy the sun, or a brisk walk in colder weather...great way to spend time.||July 13, 2019
Jannerbloke||50||Perfect weather and setting for a sell out great concert yesterday evening. In a large area close to the Serpentine we were lucky enough to have tickets for the gold area. Excellent catering and facilities. Not as grand as the corporate area but an ideal setting for hospitality and the performance itself. Predictably the vast majority of concert goers were our age or over, so nearly pensioners and above. Dylan is obviously aging and he seemed to given a slight jazz lilt to his voice which is not as gravelly as it once was but impressive nonetheless and he sang most of the songs we had hoped for and more besides. Plenty of stamina still. Neil Young was superb. Couldn’t have been better. Hyde Park’s summer season of concerts are unrivalled. Well worth the effort and expense.||July 13, 2019
Diana K||40||A very big city park. See the ducks on the water and walk around this vast park. A nust do while in London. Don't miss it.||July 12, 2019
Andrea-Washington||50||I attended a concert in the park last weekend and it was absolutely brilliant. From getting in to the venue, queuing for food and drinks, even using the toilets, everything was so well organised. We were no where near the stage but screens were available, sound was spot on and atmosphere was just AMAZING! Great artists this year so looking forward to seeing what next year brings ||July 12, 2019
Grandview301||50||We walked through Hyde Park and thoroughly enjoyed it. There is something for everyone here. Enjoying refreshments at various locations throughout, on the water in pedal or rowing boats along the Serpentine, swimming at the Lido, horse riding, relaxing in deck chairs, admiring statues and tributes (Princess Diana) and in particular the friendly fauna. Great place to escape the heat too.||July 12, 2019
814debic||50||We went here this morning with a picnic lunch. My family and I had a lovely time. We played cards, ate our lunches, and played frisbee on the lawn. It is a huge park with lots of people and lots of beauty around. The water is beautiful with opportunities to ride paddle boats. They were preparing for a concert in the park so there were many things going on. We loved it and unfortunately had to leave earlier than we wanted to to go to a Shakespearean play. We would highly recommend a visit to Hyde Park.||July 12, 2019
bdtrip17||50||What a beautiful park in the heart of London. The grounds are very well kept, we had a nice walk. Their walking tails are well maintained and there are amazing flowers throughout. Boating experience was a plus too!||July 11, 2019
digebara||50||The British summer time events are a must!! The idea is to book tickets early as there is great damn for them. I went to see Celine Dion this year and apart from the location been easy to travel to, it’s always so well organised with lots of choice of food and drinks. The location is the best of British!! Always lots going on and things to do||July 11, 2019
Rachgen||50||attended a concert there, the organisation was superb, no queing, plenty of food and drink available , civilised and it helped that the weather was super||July 11, 2019
janla2019||50||London does an incredible job of providing and maintaining beautiful common areas. Take a day, a book, a friend and a bottle to Hyde park and enjoy!||July 10, 2019
LondonLonso||50||Great place for a picnic. Lots of greens to lay your mat on; or benches under shade if you want to sit nicely. There are small cafes and snack bars if you don’t have time to pack food. Prepare for long walks if you want to see all areas of the park - it is a really vast area and you can actually take a bus around the perimeter if you want to go from one end to the other. Public restrooms are a available. Best part is the Round Pond - literally a pond where swans peacefully glide on - and the area near Serpentine Cafe where you can lazily sip coffee (and have some good hot food) while watching boat riders across the pond. If you get tired of nature, there’s the South Kensington museums on one side of the perimeter or Kensington Palace on the other side; or Harrods and shopping on the other||July 10, 2019
91HarrietWood||40||Fantastic experience on Sunday night seeing the wonderful Barbra Streisand. Site was well thought out with plenty of food & drink vendors alongside drinking water points and toilets which were well managed and regularly cleaned. Only downside was drinks prices were as always a rip off, £6.50 for a can of Pimms is madness! Will definitely look out for tickets for next year. ||July 10, 2019

yorkshirelasses2018||40||Just spent another week end at this years British Summertime Festival which was excellent, even the toilet queues were better organised. The headline acts were fantastic and support acts very good too. Plenty of food and drink variety and reasonably priced for London. Well done||July 9, 2019

IanH4022||50||A wonderful day in and about Hyde Park. Not as busy as I thought it would be. Hired some bikes to peddle around. These worked with ease and made the whole experience full. I’d recommend this park to anybody who just wanted to chill and get their head around life! Beautiful!||July 9, 2019
manin_9||50||Came here on Sunday to see the phenomenal Barbara Streisand she came on in the evening.Hyde park had fantastic people in costumes dancing to music.Places to eat where set like a saloon,so many varieties of different foods.Bottle of wine was pricey at £25 a bottle.Large screens scattered around in order to see. Great venue||July 9, 2019
JK888Travel||40||Usually tourist will not visit park when in London, especially many attractions in the city. But if you are a travellers, and love to enjoy like the locals, then you should visit the Hyde Park. This park was really big area in the middle of the city, and slightly away from main shopping district, but Harrods shopping mall is nearby, you may visit the supermarket and buy some nice bread and drinks for a interesting picnic experience in the park. It was a really clean, spacious, beautiful and many resting area, and you will be surprise to meet squirrels in the middle of the park, they always hiding in the trees, so be patience, they will come out to meet you when someone feeding feeding the birds, and you will be real surprise how fun playing with them. Anyway, the park is huge, so just spend few hours walking around and enjoy the life like a local.||July 9, 2019
Andrew G||50||A fantastic venue. Well organized. Artists great and Barbra headlining. Amazing. Will visit again soon||July 9, 2019
SilentHolidays||50||We went here for the Stevie Wonder concert, and it is a very pleasant park, large, and clean. Outside the park is a little worse, as Marble Arch is full is homeless, and non-nationals which look very dodgy indeed, but Hyde Park itself is nice.||July 9, 2019
janee882||50||One off the bucket list. Venue was set out well - lots of bars etc.She was amazing!Great atmosphere even the weather held out||July 9, 2019

Beverley O||50||Got last minutes tickets for Sunday where I saw Barbra Streisand and guests it was amazing, the event was really well organised the food was amazing plenty of stalls selling food and alcohol and a variety of different stall, great atmosphere plenty of room to sit down and enjoy the day. My first experience of an event in Hyde park but would definately would go again.||July 8, 2019
skollath||50||This part is huge....plan accordingly. We took the tube to get from one side to the other. Kensington Palace on one side with people riding bikes, walking dogs, enjoying the day. They have a place to purchase food and ice cream. The other side of the park has a place called Speakers Corner. People literally up on soap boxes speaking their opinions about very controversial issues. You can pick and choose what or who to listen to....very interesting conversations. It was enlightening for our 16 year old...but also keep your eyes open as they sometimes have problems with the crowds and heated discussions. Police had to be called in later that night after we left. ||July 8, 2019
barrule||40||Visited Hyde Park on really nice sunny day particularly yo see Peter Pan. The park is a huge green open space where you can just wander aimlessly or swim, spend time on the boats or just sit and relax. Just wish we had more time to enjoy..........one day!!||July 8, 2019
Kathryn F||50||We really enjoyed Hyde Park, as we attended the Celine Dion Concert and had a fantastic time. We walked the Park every day and enjoyed the flowers, birds and the cafe - they do a mean scrambled egg on toast (recommend).||July 8, 2019
clairekeating6||50||On our recent trip to London myself and my friend had the luck of great weather and being situated very close to Hyde park. It’s a great place with a wide range of things you can enjoy. ||July 8, 2019
hasker||50||As part of a meandering walk from the Natural HIstory museum to Buckingham Palace we wandered along the Serpentine in Hyde Park.The kids had fun watching the ducks and other waterfowl, the ex and me had fun drinking beer right on the lake/river. There were strategically located playgrounds at appropriate points, and the kids only complained about how much they were walking every hundred meters or so. A fine time was had by all. ||July 8, 2019
Michael W||50||A lovely park where you can escape the crowds and the hustle and bustle that is London. Many paths to choose from and all offer something different to see.||July 7, 2019

cgmk551||50||Hyde Park we walked from one end to another very clean park had a beach you can rent beach chairs for about 8 dollars it also had horse trails.||July 7, 2019
nickys378||20||£85 + £10 admin charge for ‘general admission’ which gets you nowhere near the stage at all. Have to watch a screen so you may as well watch a concert at home. Everything very expensive and the drink / food prices are equally extortionate with a ridiculous lack of choice as you are not permitted to take anything’s in at all. No drink no food. Wine £25 bottle, beer £6.50, small cans of G &T, vodka & cranberry or dark rum and coke all £6.50!!! That was it. All serve warm. No other choices. Absolute rip off!!! I work in London so thought I was used to London prices but this was exceptionally bad. Loaded up the app - no internet Got the Barclaycard WiFi code - still no connection You’d think with such large corporate sponsors this would be sorted but no!! Found the support acts depressing and never really got the crowd going at all. Lots of waiting around between acts. Expensively disappointing rubbish day!! Never again.||July 7, 2019
KirkyLou89||50||I just love how there is such a serene place to sit either on the grass or on a bench in the centre of London. It's so lovely to walk around and there's actually a lot of wildlife. We had a picnic here the other day and it was so lovely to just be able to sit and relax in such a busy city. We also didn't see any rubbish, which was certainly nice to see nowadays!||July 6, 2019

HA12014||50||A big park in the middle of London. Nice place to be to walk to cool yourself from the heat and to see the lake and other monuments. The park is really green and it was really amazing to watch yesterday also celine dion live concert there. They will have also several other concerts during the music festival of London. I recommend the visit ||July 5, 2019

I_of_Texas||50||Enjoyed a walk through this well kept and well attended park in Central London. The memorial fountain to Princess Diana is a unique piece of design work and worth a visit to the park just to see the memorial.||July 5, 2019
Judejourneywoman||40||Take a stroll through this lovely, green and wide garden. Hyde Park has many nooks and crannies and walking paths, meaning that you can (almost) feel a million miles from nowhere whilst being in the centre of glorious London Town. ||July 4, 2019
rockobello||50||Beautiful big park, plenty of flowers, trees, paths, lake and birds. There is a swimmable part but I wouldn't do it. (Lake is full of bird feces). Great place to unwind and relac after visiting many of London's landmarks.||July 4, 2019
Dieter_Sch_13||40||The park is a fantastic green space that is well used. The Italian garden is pretty. The biggest problem is the shortage of toilets. There was a sign to some underground toilets but they were locked up and looked like they hadn’t been used in a long time. It was a very long walk to find the next one. ||July 4, 2019
scarfy37||50||Loved walking from one end to the other. So much to see. Walked through many times and still see something new. This time was the Albert memorial.||July 3, 2019
James F||40||Hyde Park is deceptively huge. It's history is job-dropping (Henry the VIII used it to hunt). It's a pretty park, but not spectacular until (and if) you get to the lake, which is incredible.||July 3, 2019

sukest||40||I chose to walk through Hyde Park on my way from the train station to my hotel, rather than taking the tube. I'm so glad I did. It was late Sunday afternoon, about 5pm, lots of squirrels in the park. Then when got to the Serpentine lake there were lot of families walking through, children watching the ducks and swans. A really well worth walk through the park, which is centrally located in London.||June 30, 2019

caz0610||40||First visit to Hyde Park and spent the best part of the day here.You wouldn’t think you were in the middle of a capital city as it’s so quiet. You hear the birds, insects and there are plenty areas to sit and watch the world go by and take some time for yourself.Loads to see and do - Italian gardens, Serpentine boating lake, Peter Pan statue, Serpentine Gallery, Albert Memorial, Diana Memorial (where you can paddle your feet on a hot day), Kensington Palace and loads of walking areas through the park.||June 29, 2019

Beth M||50||Hyde Park is a lovely park in the middle of London. Walking through the park gives you peace and quiet in the midst of the busy city.

NWC07||10||I wanted to visit this well known park but was quickly turned off by the large group of homeless men and women camped out fighting, spitting and generally causing chaos. The shopping in the adjacent area is quite good. We took the tube to Marble Arch- many great shops to be seen. Pass on Hyde Park!||June 28, 2019
Stephen B||40||This is one of London's beautiful, well-laid out parks and a great spot for a stroll. The Serpentine Lake in the center is pretty. I am stunned, though, that people actually swim in this lake given the number of ducks, swans, and other birds in the water, which looks pretty foul. It would be the last place in the world I would swim.||June 28, 2019
theeagle10||40||Walked around Hyde Park one afternoon after arriving in London. Was cold and raining but all you need is warm clothes and a hotel umbrella. Beautiful trees, gardens, lakes, statues and other points of interest. Has several gates and in summer the gates are open until dusk, which is June is around 9:30 pm.||June 27, 2019

Only a stones throw from the Albert Hall too. Go there you will enjoy it.||June 26, 2019

Rick G||30||We were two families from Texas spending 2 weeks on a European vacation, visiting London, Paris and Barcelona European 14 Day trip from Texas. We had spent months planning this trip, to get the best bang for our bucks and see as many sites as possible.This is a large,active, scenic park with a lot of walkers, joggers, bicyclist and people enjoying them selves on sports or picnics. We experienced the park and sought out the Princess Di memorial. The memorial was kind of disappointing and can see it slowly going unnoticed down the road. Since we only had a few days to spend in London, we probably could have passed on the Parks, (Hyde, St James and Green) and spend a little more time on the other sites. But if you have the time or desire to really enjoy a park , then this would be ideal||June 25, 2019
HeleneG||50||My hotel was close to Hyde Park, so I've walked through the park several times. Very lovely, clean and peaceful -- a great escape from the crowds.I have to add a bit about the dogs. I am not a dog lover, but I must say that the dogs in London are the most well-behaved creatures I've ever witnessed (better than humans). Most walk with their owners through the park leash-less. They don't bother other walkers and stay close by their owners. Many like to play fetch-and-catch with a ball. Americans need to send their dogs to London to be well trained.||June 25, 2019
FarAway547784||50||The perfect place for a nice picnic or for playing all kinds of ball games. I was told that if you are eating something squirrels will find you and steal your food. Did not really happen to us. :) He was curious what did we eat but once he smelled it was not interested anymore. The enormous trees are a really good shelter against the rain. We were caught by it but did not get wet under them at all.||June 25, 2019
Ben L||50||very good location to visit Princess Diana's Memorial Fountain, Kensington Palace.best to visit during summer where there is sun.lots of different types of birds for viewing||June 24, 2019
BiGloGoh||50||There are more amenities in the park now then before. This is a trip down memory lane for me therefore it’s extremely enjoyable. It was a bright and sunny day when I’d visited. I personally find the park nearer the serpentine river more enjoyable than other parts. Buy your favorite coffee and a good book to seat by Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. As the fountain is constructed with different terrain to create different water movements, there are lots of photo moments. The Serpentine Sackler Gallery is a fine piece of architecture work; new modern extension on old conservation. The restaurant next to the art gallery seems to be serving fine food. Or, you may take a stroll along the Serpentine. Take a rest on one of the benches to watch people and the world goes by. The benches are so close to the water edges that you feel part of the scene. They are very popular too as they are free and limited. The foldable sun chairs charge at a small fee. It’s a large urban park that most people, including tourist visit and it can be connect via various undergrounds. A must visit if u have spare time. ||June 24, 2019

FIREtraveler4730||40||One of the best things about London is the amount of green space they have in the city. Hyde Park is a nice place to go for a walk and unwind from the bustling city life. The park is enormous and you could easily spend a few hours here just wandering around.||June 24, 2019

You are able to rent paddle boats and there is a restaurant next to the lake. There is also a memorial to Princess Diana that consist of a circular shallow wadding area. There were a lot of kids walking around this water feature. There are a lot of beautiful photo spots including their gardens. Great place to visit on a sunny day. From here we walked to Buckingham Palace and St. James Park.||June 23, 2019

Susan S||40||The park is very big. Better visit it in summer. It's so cold in England in early spring. There were many birds in the water. They are so beautiful.||June 20, 2019

FionaMacF||40||We enjoyed a walk people watching on a sunny Sunday. It is glorious to see people, young and old, enjoying the peace and tranquillity so close to the centre of London.||June 20, 2019
m_stanford_texas||50||I didn't think I'd care much to visit a park after traveling all the way to London... but I was wrong! Hyde Park is beautiful and a lot of fun. The Princess Di fountain is neat, and the lake is a great experience. Rent the paddle boats and buy a box of duck food from the rental store :) It's just a short walk to end of Hyde Park to visit Kensington Palace.||June 19, 2019
Cheryl B||50||Our guide brought us here to see Kensington Palace and the sunken gardens -- gorgeous! Walking through the park was quite pleasant.||June 19, 2019
Adrian B||40||This is one of London's great parks and well worth a visit if you want to quiet and soothing to stretch your legs||June 19, 2019
Nkhrayef||50||Always have to visit even if its only one night in London. I just love it, kids have fun lots of stuff going on ||June 18, 2019
JazzyButtons||40||Take time to visit this piece of tranquility in the big city. We spent a few hours wandering around the park. Took time to walk through the rose garden, visit Diana’s memorial fountain, stopped for hot chocolate at the cafe and Royal Albert’s memorial. So much to see.....make sure you take some time to wander through Hyde Park. ||June 18, 2019
Joanne K||40||We ended up in Hyde park as the only place we could find for our younger son to safely try one of the Lime Bikes that can be rented around the city. They don't seem to be allowed in most parks but here it was okay. We also sat by the water and ate really good burgers (I'm sorry I don't remember the name of the place). It's not as pretty a park as some of the others, but still a good spot for a rest. Speakers Corner in the Northeast corner of the park is well worth a visit normally, though it was quiet when we were there.||June 18, 2019
CamillaD915||50||An oasis in the middle of a big city, what more can I say. Loved that part of the park was a bit wild looking, not so perfect.||June 18, 2019
Gabigabs||50||Hyde Park offers a refuge from the hustle of the city. It’s so calming you will indeed forget you are still in the center of London. ||June 18, 2019
MissChann||40||When you come here, you’d forget that you’re right in Central London, West End. A great place to chill and unwind. In the summer, it does get full of teens just being stupid and it being a bait motive spot. ||June 18, 2019
Poolegirly||40||Went for a wander around before going out in the evening. The park is beautiful, we went past the Diana memorial play ground and walked to the pond. It was lovey and so many people enjoying the open space on a sunny afternoon. It is a real oasis I. The centre of London away from the hustle and bustle.Many thanks||June 18, 2019
katmacrone||50||Really enjoyed London's parks. The city knows how to do a park it was perfect for relaxing and a early morning run.||June 18, 2019
RCIT||30||Lovely for a stroll in a green space in the city. Can't say I was too excited about it, but I've been highly spoiled by other parks.||June 17, 2019
ejcrowe||50||If you’re not from an urban area yourself, spending ten days in London like we did could be draining were it not for lush, beautiful green spaces like Hyde Park. We enjoyed our stroll across the park, pausing on the various benches to sit and take it all in. I recommend doing what we did: go to Harrod’s to pick up an amazing lunch to eat in the park.||June 17, 2019
rmeade88||50||Stopped into Hyde Park with some treats and drinks to take a break on a busy sightseeing day in London. Great time sitting around feeding the ducks and just relaxing. The trees and gardens are so beautiful. Definitely will have to spend more time in the future. We did sit in the city provided chairs for about an hour and were not charged at all. Apparently, they charge a few bucks to use the chairs if you sit there long enough. Great fun and good crowd on the day we visited. ||June 17, 2019
JoeBlack1972||50||During a stay in London it is great to walk trough the park to rest. We met there a man who fed pigeons, squirrels and parrots, who live there. If you have birdseed the birds will land on your Hand and take the seed out of your Hand, Great!Our children and also we where fascinated!||June 17, 2019
SamuelBooth1997||50||Looking for a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of the city? you're looking at the right place! Every time I visit London I HAVE to go to Hyde Park, it's just stunning! stop reading this and go and see for yourself :D||June 17, 2019
KengH||50||Huge park..plenty to do for kids as well as adults. We loved every single moment spent here - feeding the ducks, boating in the Serpentine, pizza in the cafe, awesome pirate playground for the little ones, ice cream on the grass, frisbee with the dogs and kids, climbing the big tree by Hyde Park Corner, admiring the Albert memorial, smelling the flowers in the flower walk, taking photos of the wildlife, making daisy chains, I can simply go on forever. Definitely not to be missed. ||June 17, 2019

VetsWife W||40||Kensington Palace (home of Prince William and Kate) is at the edge of this park. Beautiful, well groomed park. Lots of walking to arrive at the Palace. Sometimes very steep inclines. The public restrooms were locked. One of the guards(security, police??) told us they were closed due to budget cuts.||June 16, 2019
321bradleyr||50||I fit in a morning 5k run through Hyde Park, and it was a great way to see the park and meet Londoners. ||June 16, 2019
aaronw58||40||If you get a little weary of all the hustle and bustle of walking and riding around trying to see all of the great sites in London, I recommend taking a stroll through this place for some down time. Or if you still want to get your daily run accomplished while on vacation, do it here. The Park is well-maintained and pretty. There is a big pond/lake in the middle where many people were paddle-boarding or kayaking. There are cycling lanes and running lanes. People were on blankets having picnics, and all sorts of other activities. I suggest starting at the Wellington Arch and walk all the way through the park until you get to Kensington Palace and walk through the Palace gardens. You can also pay to go in and see the Palace if you choose.||June 15, 2019
CleopatraBunny||40||The park was near our hotel so we planned our stroll for the end of a busy day of touring (and all the crowds!). There is plenty to see, from the Princess Diana memorial to Speaker’ Corner and fountains. Check the orientation map at the entrance to plan your walk and see the highlights. ||June 15, 2019

Been to the serpentine element, but so much more to see and enjoy.Very nice formal garden elements, with plenty of well run cafes and lots of room with plenty of space for dogs as well.We actually had over 5 hours walking around and I am sure plenty else to see and greatly enjoyed the visit.||June 15, 2019
Ron G||50||Spent a few hours walking through Hyde Park. Wonderful outdoor space. The grounds are very well maintained and there were many people enjoying the park that day. Too bad we do not use our parks in this way in the US.||June 15, 2019

bookworm8||50||We loved the gardens blooming this time of year! Wow! The nearby Marble Arch and Speaker's corner were fun, but the flowers were my favorite. We also caught a parade of locals and the horse guard returning from Buckingham palace.||June 13, 2019
toemiss||50||Beautiful park, clean and fun to explore. People can easily get lost in time here. We planned to stay in Hyde Park for max 1hr, but then we realised we've been there for 2.5hr. Love the greens, water ways, swans, ducks, squirrels, birds etc etc. Oh there is also a beautiful rose garden! ||June 12, 2019
baxterleanne||40||One of my favorite things to do is walk through Hyde park. So many birds and wildlife. I love all the swans and now in spring they have babies. The flowers are in full bloom in a wray of colors. Loads of things to see. Must stop at Princess Diana’s fountain.||June 12, 2019
iluvsydney||50||What a beautiful park! We spend over 3 hours here and there was so much to do for the kids and adults as well. The squirrels posed for us (which was hilarious). Very picturesque and soothing to be a part of a city as large as this. Wonderful experience - wishing for an opportunity to go back one day again!||June 12, 2019
billid181||40||Vast park in middle of such big city and clean and safe, good for biking which we did not do but if we go back it will be a must for us.||June 10, 2019
CraigJCalhoun||50||One of London's several great parks, Hype Park offers nice walks and views. It's peace in the city, but also with interesting people watching and occasionally still people on a literal soap box at Speaker's corner. Not so much a destination as simply a pleasant place in a ritzy neighborhood.||June 10, 2019
Betsymh||50||Lovely park, with a spectacular rose garden in full bloom in early June. Sections of the park are left as meadows for the bees and butterflies, other parts are more mown and formal.||June 10, 2019

siobhaindoyle||50||I went here with my husband and my 2 kids which was a very enjoyable experience. It is a big park so it doesn't feel completely overcrowded and it is a nice place to have a nice picnic. It was definitely an enjoyable stroll and my family and I enjoyed some of the delicious ice cream as well!||June 10, 2019
jeanb1876||40||Being from Chicago, we love city parks. Hyde Park is one of the best. It is a great break from the hectic pace of sightseeing in London. Any direction you walk in Hyde Park will be a pleasant, beautiful experience. It's never terribly crowded, probably because it is large enough, you just aren't overrun with people.We were there in May with many things beginning to bloom but I would suspect it is pretty most of the year. Definitely an enjoyable stroll on a pretty day.||June 9, 2019
cliff3232016||50||A nice green area close to Central London. Many pleasant and varied areas for example Alarge lake, boating pool, gardens and miles of walks.||June 9, 2019

M2841VHcarlam||50||A place to go in london Beautiful balance nature and urban life..My favourite place to run away from the city building forest. I Love the contact with the animals, squirrels the ducks and swans; lay down on the grass and enjoy a bath of sun rays; drink a coffee and walk for hours. ||June 8, 2019

2Travel2all||40||Took a long stroll through! It was peaceful! Landscaping was nice, interesting water fowl, people and stops. Met a few nice people on park benches.If your looking for a stroll and less hectic, this is the place to be! You can sit and people watch, or bird watch! Roller skaters dancing was fun to watch! Few places to grave a bite to eat or drink around as well. It’s a big place!||June 7, 2019

FoodCloudie||50||Beautiful - a great way to spend the morning and have a nice walk. The Italian gardens are especially beautiful with a cafe just near by.A tip is to go on Sunday morning where local artists sell their paintings along the gate of the park in the side where the Italian gardens are.Definitely worth a visit||June 6, 2019

Joan C||40||We did a short side trip in to Hyde Park on our way to another place. The gardens are very pretty and the lake area was busy with animals and people. We will need to go back to see a few other highlights the next time we are in London. Beautiful!||June 5, 2019

ChiYogirunner||40||So special to have Park’s in the middle of an urban city. Although it brought on some allergies it was nice to see green grass and water. ||June 5, 2019
Wandering_Tortoise||50||I visited Hyde Park with my partner for an evening stroll.When in Hyde Park it certainly seems like you are in a bubble away from the bustling city. The Eastern side of the park has beautiful flowers and fields to relax, especially in lovely weather. The Serpentine is quite peaceful with the Swans and other wildlife that make it and the rest of the park their home. The only real disruption to all this nature is the West Carriage Driveway the runs through the park dividing it into the East and West sections.The Albert Memorial and Kensington Palace stand boldly in the Western part of the Park and are sights to behold.I highly recommend a visit to Hyde Park on a lovely day. You can easily spend half a day exploring the park.||June 5, 2019
Funinstore||50||Beautiful fantastic place to enjoy the hustle and bustle of LondonAlways good for all ages at all times of day and evening ||June 5, 2019
Angela M||40||We had a spare day and spent it casually exploring the parks. We walked around most of the park and were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful gardens, the variety of birds and the monuments that we came across, plenty of benches dotted around and lovely picnic areas. Lots of squirrels to keep you amused. A lovely day full of fresh air and lovely surroundings.||June 5, 2019
HannahJ1967||40||lovely... i can say that London is not a city anymore its a country inside the country all i can say is that i love this country.||June 5, 2019
boheme6||50||The title really says it all. Lots of space here to wander, explore, and relax. I also really enjoyed all the dogs running around and saying hi, but that's me. Lucked out and saw a mamma goose with all her baby geese too which was cute.||June 4, 2019
Robert P||40||It would be almost impossible to see all of Hyde Park in one visit. It covers a vast area which comprises woodlands, grasslands and waterways, the main one called the Serpentine. It is easy to see why Hyde Park is popular with joggers, dog walkers and others. You might get lucky and see the occasional guardsmen on horses practising their stuff. Well worth a walk through.||June 4, 2019
jsilverman83||40||This park is pretty huge with a ton of big green open spaces, at least one large restaurant, many kinds of birds, a big lake, and a whole bunch of statues, gardens, and memorials. Great for just relaxing, or taking a walk, or biking/skating, or sightseeing the art and memorials and gardens!||June 4, 2019
roxywads||50||I have lived near heathrow for the past 30 years but as luck would have it never got time to ever go and explore the park.. A friend came from abroad so decided to meet up in London, he got delayed so went for a walk in the park and got tranquilized in the surrounding nature where Wildlife,statues, cyclists, trees, lakes and where one can comfort his soul while strolling in the park all made it a day to remember. Its simply spectacular. A TRULY GOD'S BACK YARD||June 4, 2019
Naga64||40||Walked through Hyde Park twice last weekend and It is beautiful and lush with the foliage and flowers in bloom. The rose garden was a particular highlight. It gets busy around the lakes but you can always find a quiet corner to just dream the day away or picnic under some shade. ||June 4, 2019
Abriluz||50||We went on December and all the Xmas market was amazing, we found a lot of stuff to do. The food over there was really nice! Don´t take water with you or sharp object, they will take that from you at the entrance. Security stuff. ||June 4, 2019
Paul M||50||First time I tried the cafe. Lovely location right on the serpentine. A bit pricey but that is to be expected. Fantastic coffee. ||June 4, 2019
Stephenstanley||50||I visited this beautiful park in the middle of our capital city and found the peace and tranquillity outstanding. The views were good and both the Albert Hall and Kensington Palace looked stunning||June 4, 2019
shaross||30||We visited the park twice and was disappointed with how dirty it was. The memorial fountain was nice, but they were allowing children/adults to walk in it which was I thought disgraceful.||June 4, 2019
Maria V||50||We were so lucky to experience this park on a beautiful sunny London day. We had a picnic enjoying fresh take out from Pret a Manger. A beautiful experience! A lovely vibe in the park too with everyone chilled and enjoying the sun and nature.||June 4, 2019
Smileychick1985||50||Had a lovely wonder round the park and sat and enjoyed a coffee. Well kept and beautiful! Could spend hours here relaxing and its very easy to get to. ||June 4, 2019
B G||50||There are so many facets to this green space it is hard to name them all, even harder to believe it is in the middle of Londdon. My advice is just to walk around slowly and experience it all. And if you get tired, go down along the Serpentine and you'll find a lovely cafe to relax and revive yourself.||June 3, 2019
cskmck||50||Only spent a little while here looked at the lake and the ducks and swans. My wife just wanted to see it because she read about in so many books.||June 3, 2019

Jacqueline W||50||Every time I visit London I try and get to Hyde Park for a stroll and a coffee just to get out of the business of the city... it’s enormous so it never feels too busy. There’s space for every one. Enjoy whatever the weather.||June 2, 2019
Rachel B||50||Worht a visit!! The swams are super close and are apparently all owned by the Queen. Love this park and a good area to walk around. Make sure you go as you won't regret it!||June 2, 2019

momto52018||50||This park is so amazing. Be sure and rent a bike near the entrance. So many wonderful paths to bike along. Our teens loved it. Made for a nice, relaxing family day.||June 1, 2019
Kimberly A||50||Kensington Gardens is just at Hyde Park’s boundary, so it’s easy to confuse which park you’re in at a given time if you aren’t carrying a map: if you’re unfamiliar with the space... HP is lively by day (restaurants, ice cream booths, boat rentals) and tranquil by early morning (runners, bikers, dog-walkers, bird feeders, and swimmers in the ice cold serpentine!!!!). A lovely place to exercise or think or get one’s creative juices flowing. People-traffic increases as the day moves ahead, but the scene is just as lovely. Large bit of land, very worth walking through if you have the time— and really take enough time to breath it all in. It may take a day or two.||June 1, 2019
Samiya7||30||This is a very large park that requires lots of walking. It was beautiful and green in May. There is a serpentine lake in the middle with a memorial to Princess Diana. ||May 31, 2019

My2cents-adviser||50||Got some Santander bikes and rode them around the park. Great fun, lots to see, good exercise and good value. Easy to operate with a holder on the front for your bag. Really fun way to see another part of London and a change from museums. I was with 3 teenagers and they loved it! Got the app before hand to check locations and easy to then purchase others at the actual rank.||May 31, 2019

charlespd1985||50||Gardens , lakes and woodland. The countryside in the city. A great place for families, couples and lone runners. Take your pick of the all weather paths or head off onto the grass. Play areas for kids including trees you can climb and trees to hide in. The Serpentine has opportunities to boat, bird warch or even swim.There are also coffee shops where you can just sit and watch the world go by.||May 30, 2019
laureltreb||40||Lovely to walk around and stretch the legs after a long flight. Good way to get to Buckingham Palace. Really enjoyed watching people walk their dogs before work and loved that there are cafe’s and bathrooms available. ||May 30, 2019

michaelsZ9233FB||50||No doubt in my mind that this is one of the best parl i visited in London. A lot of people, of course, but demonstrates that we are all the same in our attempt to enjoy nature and rest...||May 29, 2019
fceteacher||50||We spent the afternoon here just walking the paths and looking at the ducks and birds. There are signs to help you identify them if you desire but its so beautiful either way. ||May 29, 2019

gman174||40||I like nothing better than a stroll from one end to the other when in London. It’s really peaceful and relaxing sitting by the lake or watching the squirrels run about. Good to get away from the hustle of London. I use it as a rest day when visiting London to revitalise. ||May 28, 2019
506stellaf||50||Hyde Park is easily accessible by public transport, and given the size, it’s easy to find your own space, even on a busy spring evening. Always a great place for a a walk, keeping an eye out for squirrels, and seeing the swans, geese and ducks on the Serpentine. ||May 28, 2019
samanthajean7||50||When you're in London, always take a walk through Hyde Park! Whether it's snowing or sunny, it's always so picturesque.||May 28, 2019

VadimF7||50||Although we are still not sure about Brexit I will refer to it as Central Park of Europe. Amazing place, especially in the summer, very central and quite vast, although not as big as the park in Manhattan. Summertime offers some music festivals while Christmas time has a winter wonderland every year||May 27, 2019
tracy123579||40||Lovely place to wonder through, sit by the lake or feed the squirrels. We were fortunate to see a marching band go through and visit Kensington palace, Princess Diana’s memorial fountain and admire the colourful gardens. Easy to walk around and add adjacent Kensington gardens as well.||May 27, 2019
carmism||50||I walked from my hotel to Hyde Park which in itself offered so much to see. What a wonderful space! The weather was wonderful and the park offered lots to explore. There were people out and about with their families and pets, the flowers were blooming, and it was a very relaxing place to be. ||May 27, 2019
I8327KXamandab||50||We stayed directly across the street from the park and it was absolutely lovely! We walked through it nearly every day to get to our destination, or just to simply enjoy the beauty of the park. ||May 27, 2019
ToonPatriot||50||One of the few places in London you can just get away from it all for an hour or two. Nice to see the ducks and the birds and grab an ice cream if that's your thing.||May 27, 2019
Cheryl T||50||We decided to walk around Hyde Park early in the morning and have breakfast on the lake. It was really lovely. The park is huge and amazingly beautiful. Kids would love it, especially when there are people riding their horses through. We then continued our walk from Hyde Park Corner down to Buckingham Palace then Bird Cage Road down to Westminster Pier to catch the ferry up the river. I recommend this walk as it was really lovely.||May 26, 2019
KenObvious||50||Close to my office. Lunchtime runs round the perimeter - approx 4 miles or round the serpentine - approx 2 miles. ||May 26, 2019
Stephen D||50||Take some time out on the tourist trail to rest .. grab a snack & sit in this quiet relaxing park central to major attraction , green & relaxing .,. Back on track||May 26, 2019
bcheong||40||Staying at park lane and this park is just a 5 minute walk away. It’s large and very nice if there is sunshine. We were lucky for a few hours and as we left, the london drizzle started. Avoid the serpentine restaurant by the lake, it’s awful||May 26, 2019
JenLin3||50||Hyde park is a must if you are in London! It’s like coming to a different place all together. Every time I come here I forget that I am in a big city. Walking in Hyde park you can see a whole lot of birds and flowers. I just love it here!||May 25, 2019
Kerry C||50||Outstanding public park. Don't miss the Italian Garden there. It's a well used park with lots of visitors.||May 25, 2019
Katwhite39||50||After arriving in London after an all night flight, we got checked into our hotel which was quite close to the Park. It was a perfect activity to go for a stroll through the park and relax. It is so peaceful when wandering through some of the paths. We actually got back again during our visit to walk some more. Much easier to enjoy a long walk without fighting the crowds on the sidewalks. It’s good to see that it’s so well enjoyed by so many people. Always see many running, walking and cycling throughout. Must be great in the summer months.||May 25, 2019
linda A||50||Hyde park is right next to Kensington park it is so beautiful. Visiting the park is so magical. Must see.||May 24, 2019
dimitra p||50||It is so big, that you can have your space to relax almost everywhere. I always visit Hyde Park when I travel to London.||May 23, 2019
michellem311||50||An absolutely fantastic park for all to visit, in my opinion one, of the best in the world. So many places to see and visit. ||May 23, 2019
carmenh9393||50||This park is giant, so know that it will take you a day if you want to see it all, or more. Take a stroll and relax. You'll see a lot of great birds, beautiful fountains and lakes.||May 23, 2019
MIupperpeninsula||50||We took a leisurely walk from Kensington Palace to Marble Arch, stopping at the Diana Memorial Fountain, enjoying a delicious lunch at an outdoor café. Beautiful rose garden. Be sure to visit Hyde Park!||May 23, 2019
SanneK786||40||Hyde Park is bigger than Monaco but ever so tranquile. It was a pleasure walking there. People were swimming and birds were singing and it was so peaceful smack right in the middle of London. Well worth a visit.||May 23, 2019
hpnyctravelR||50||A stroll through Hyde Park's Kensington Gardens a must. Just what we needed after shopping, dinners and Theatre going. Such an Oasis. ||May 22, 2019
michaelrp2018||50||Large, one of the few parks with several waterways - amazing how London has kept such open green space protected in central london||May 22, 2019
JULES4GEORGE||50||We visited here recently. A beautiful park, nice to sit and watch the world go by.It's hard to imagine that you are in a big city whilst in this park.Lots of birds and squirrels. Spotlessly clean, a must do whilst visiting London.||May 22, 2019
ElizabethLilly||50||I lucked out with a May trip when apparently the weather JUST started to be nice in London. My friend who lives there insisted that we go to the park and eat ice cream because the weather was TOO nice not to. Obviously, we had to pull my arm to get me there. We entered at what I believe is by the Lancaster Gate tube stop where they set out striped deck chairs on the lawn that look like they're straight out of Mary Poppins. Granted, hardly anything in this life is free and you have to pay a guy in a neon yellow vest to sit in the chairs by the hour but they're so worth it. Yet if you don't want to pay to sit, you can always just sit on the grass or bring your own seating. And when you're ready to head to another touristy hot spot, you can walk through the park to Buckingham Palace for all sorts of photo ops!||May 21, 2019
maya_prelst||50||When you go ther take nuts for squirells and bread for birds. They are very social there.There are a lot of to see in the park||May 21, 2019
giorgia s||50||Always coming here for walk. Park is so huge, always clean and always full but anyway is the best place to rest if you live around or even if you come just for walk. Me and my daughter we love to admire the swans, ducks and the squirrel. So amazing this park||May 21, 2019
Natesmith1016||50||When it's warm and sunny in the capital, which it rarely is, lol, this is a great spot to go and relax. It's just like Central Park in NYC, in fact I believe it was designed by the same person. So, if you want a nice escape from the city and want to enjoy some nature and quiet, try visiting Hyde Park. Bring walking shoes.||May 20, 2019
Primestop||40||Hyde Park is a breath of fresh air (literally) that rejuvenates you from the congestion of London. However, they appear to be growing much of the grass into meadowland, which might be good for the wildlife but when I visited it looked unkempt and scruffy.||May 20, 2019
callmegemm||50||I have the worst sense of direction and I got lost inside Hyde park trying to reach Harrods. My best friend laughed, but it was good one cause it gave me time to explore one of London's most beautiful parks. I loved the Speaker's Corner near Marble's Arch a place where so many important people (like Karl Marx or George Orwell) spoke. A place where freedom of speech is for everyone.||May 20, 2019
ashes94||50||Great area to take a relaxing stroll through and great opportunities for pictures! Very easy to navigate and central to many of the main attractions in London. We decided to walk through to our AirBnB instead of around which made the long walk we had very enjoyable. There are many different types of birds that are so interesting to watch we stopped a few times to take pictures. The people walking through the park were friendly and many people were walking their dogs. I would highly recommend checking this out if you need a break from walking around on your feet or the hustle and bustle of the city. ||May 19, 2019
bdio28||50||Walked through this park carrying our luggage to get to our accommodation in Paddington, I don’t advise carrying your luggage through the park because the park is HUGE, however, glad we did because the park was beautiful, gave us many excuses to put our luggage down and enjoy the park. It was so enjoyable we came back the next day too to further explore it. There were animals (the good kind) everywhere, nature blocks out the city and it feels like you have teleported to a new place altogether, all in the heart of London||May 19, 2019
MarkSheen||50||My kid had a day in the park and forgot we were in a big city. Wildlife, trees, lakes and people all made it a day to remember.||May 19, 2019
Jen H||50||Absolutely beautiful park, plenty to see, great walk and cycle paths, clean (no litter) stunning statues. ||May 19, 2019
OwenJE64||50||Although it was extremely busy it was nice to walk though the park. It’s very nice well kept park. I would come back to it. ||May 19, 2019
HarrowGal||50||A lovely park to take a stroll, run or cycle. The park is a good size with play areas and a large lake to go rowing on.||May 18, 2019
fishinwater||50||This is a great park with plenty of dedicated trails for cyclists and walkers. Plenty to see and doI did it on bike but you can travel through here any way you like. Lots of others doing the same and it was a really good experience. ||May 18, 2019
fameboy67||40||The sun was shining and the air was till so a walk around Hyde Park was a lovely bit of nature surrounded by the capital city. The restaurant next to the Serpintine was lovely and a relaxing meal was had||May 18, 2019
Simplyko||40||We had a nice quiet evening walk. Was enjoyable and enjoyed the clean air unlike the rest of London.||May 17, 2019

384ellec||50||I always find great comfort and calmness in Hyde park London. During my stay I considered London as my second home for the past 10 years, and everyday of my life that I get a chance either to walk, hand around, read my book, running, I always find myself anywhere in Hyde park London. It was an amazing place for me specially during spring and autumn. I love it.||May 16, 2019
myrleg2019||50||This park is huge, nice to sit and watch people, bike rentals and pay toilets but clean. These people were very fit!!||May 16, 2019
irishupfl||50||Hyde Park is a London gem! We were able to spend almost 2 hours strolling through the park to get to our various destinations. We loved it! It is massive and the walk ways are nice a wide to accommodate runners, walkers, and bikers. There are lawn chairs for people to sit, areas for sports and picnics. A great treasure for locals and visitors.||May 16, 2019
Linda F||50||Lovely wandering around Hyde Park on a Sunday morning. Lots of families around when we were there. Hyde Park is a huge green space in the centre of a wonderful city. ||May 16, 2019
Rich G||50||Decided to take a jog around Hyde Park starting at my hotel in Leicester Square. The 7.5 mile route was a mix between city sidewalks and finally the beauty of Hyde Park. I ran around it, not through it, but did take the trails that flanked the streets (so I was in the park as much as possible). There is nothing like Hyde Park on a sunny day in London. If I had more time, I would just sit and relax here. It's huge and plenty of nice walking trails, gardens, fountains, and people enjoying themselves. I did have to stop and snap a few photos (attached here) about three-fourths around the thing. Definitely add this park (and the other parks) to your list when visiting Central London (e.g. St James, Green Park, and Regents).||May 15, 2019
227sash||50||Could not spend much time here but the place was beautiful. Worth a visit. I went there with my mom and we loved the flowers and the birds. ||May 15, 2019
SFNica||50||Hyde Park is just beautiful. It's an excellent place to go for a stroll, run, or just to sit and enjoy the quiet in the middle of a busy busy metropolis. The park houses Kensington Palace, Prncess Diana's Fountain, the Italian Gardens, and if you have children, Princess Diana's Children's Playground. There is also a very nice long lake to take a leisurely stroll, and many benches to just watch the time pass by. ||May 14, 2019
Russ Julie T||50||Such a beautiful space, very large and so many interesting places to discover! Wide open fields, little garden nooks, and of course the lovely Serpentine.||May 14, 2019
SSJJG||50||Amazing park right in the middle of the city. We had great long walk, lots of people Roller skating and skateboarding. Lots of picnics and people generally very happy. Enjoyed boating 6 people can fit on 1 pedal boat. Choose from 30-60 mins with life jackets for children. Nice cafe over looking the Serpentine which has ducks and gooses. Ice creams stalls and public toilets around the park. Playground was great for the children under 10. A must visit if you are in central London.||May 14, 2019
TravelNotDone||50||Great place for either a shirt, medium length or long run (provided you do at least 2 1/2 laps!) Mostly flat, lots to see and not so crowded that the pedestrians slow you down. If you are a runner visiting London, Hyde Park is your running route.||May 14, 2019
WeLikeToTravel03||40||We took a stroll as soon as we arrived in London. Great for walking and relaxing. The coffee shop in the middle of the park by the swimming area was very slow, but coffee was OK.||May 14, 2019
456shirleyw||50||It is my 3rd trip to London. I visited the Hyde park every time. Trees, lake, birds, goose and animals. Green and fresh air. Peace and silence in London. I love it. ||May 13, 2019
WorldTravla7||50||I stayed in Lancaster Gate for my holiday which was easy walking distance to both Hyde Park & Kensington Gardens. The Park is acres of green in Central London and my cousin explained to me that half of it is actually Kensington Gardens which is separated from Hyde Park by the Serpentine lake (apparently Queen Caroline ordered they be separated centuries ago). There is plenty to see including the Diana Memorial Fountain, Speakers Corner, the Pan Statue, Holocaust Memorial, Albert Memorial , Reformers Tree & the Wellington Arch (to name just a few).We came just after Anzac Day and a highlight was heading Hyde Park Corner and visiting The Australian War Memorial (dedicated to the 102,000 Australian ms who died in the First and Second World Wars). My cousin is a New Zealander and The New Zealand Memorial is close by so it was great to be able to pay our respects. It was nice seeing the handwritten note from Prince Harry too.||May 13, 2019
LizaKLondon||50||My latest trip was for 420, which even if you don't smoke is worth it just for the atmosphere. Whenever it is if it's hot, it is the place to be. Everyone doing their thing, it's a small escape from the buzz of London. Just buy drinks and snack before as central is expensive. Also, toilets are usually 30p a go so bring change!||May 13, 2019
Alexandrionis||50||I'm in love with nature and animals and this park doesn't dissapoints. Worth taking a walk there and feed the birds.||May 12, 2019
BethM920||50||we walked around the park. great place to spend park of a sunny day. open grassy areas, lake, Kensington gardens and palace. if we had to do it over again, we would have rented bikes and ridden around the park so we could have covered more ground in a shorter period of time.||May 12, 2019
geogk17||50||Not to lie, i 've known Hyde Park from live concerts. However, the only thing that didn't matter when i visited, were the concerts! It was a wonderful experience!A great, great park. We spent about four hours there and still didn't manage to explore it in its entirety. I was amazed of the amount of flora and fauna one can find here, especially when you think that it is placed in London, one of the great cities of our world. It is a blessing to have such a park among the city, it is a great shelter for any lover of the natural environment.||May 12, 2019
604adik||50||Anyone can speak to anything plus an enormous park that is chill to relax. Very green and very open. Great place to have a picnic||May 11, 2019
Kegyman89||50||Big beautiful well kept park in the middle of London, to me the greatest park of all the big parks in the world. Love it.||May 11, 2019
KathleenTO||50||A walk through Hyde Park at dusk was a wonderful and peaceful way to spend an evening. It is easy to forget that this park is in the middle of a bustling capital city. It is quiet and beautiful and there are so many different species of birds to admire. The walk along the waterside is lovely but there are many gnats in the evening hours so that could be uncomfortable for some. The tribute to Diana Princess of Wales is lovely and the entire experience was very nice.||May 10, 2019
Phyllis D||50||Our hotel was across the street from the park, and we went several times. Just beautiful, even in April. Loose dogs are well behaved. Really calming place, so much nicer than Central Park in NY. Beautiful memorials, Kensington Palace, Princess Diana's memorial (as unique and modern as her, especially compared to Prince Albert's ornate memorial), and so on. However, be aware that they lock the gates at some unspecified time related to sunset. We got locked in once. There are apparently two exit-only gates so you can get out.||May 9, 2019
Andygreenfield||40||We took a leisurely stroll with friends along the serpentine. The view was fab! The horse guards were patrolling on horseback, very impressive and traditions harking back through the centuries. We got to Princess Diana’s memorial fountain and took in the peace and beauty of the water. Birds a-plenty, swans geese, goslings in numbers. I’ll be making this visit again next time we’re in London. ||May 9, 2019
Bychkovae||50||Nice, beautiful, full of swans, ducks and other birds, ponds, nice flowers and trees, cafes and sidewalks... Just be careful about the weather - it must be warm and , even better, sunny. ||May 9, 2019

Lilyland||50||I went to Hyde Park with my family... It is a really beautiful park... It is a grade I listed park in central London...There was a lot of people there when we went but it is a very large park with lots of lovely flowers, trees and well kept lawns...Hyde Park is free and is open all year round and is accessible by public transport.||May 8, 2019

Young P||50||I was visited Hyde Park in one of the sunny day in April, this is my first time visit and found there was a peaceful place for staying, good for couple, students or even family with kids. Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain was built inside of the Hyde Park. I love that area and bring back many memories of Princess Diana. We miss her..Recommend to visit this nice park if you visit London. Don't miss!!||May 7, 2019
SVar11||50||Last time I was in London, I didn't get to fully enjoy Hyde Park and all it has to offer -- just passed through. This time, I wandered the full length of the park, from the corner by the Wellington Arch, around the Serpentine to the Italian Gardens and back. I didn't realize there are parrots in the park, and they were beautiful to watch. My timing was perfect for ducklings and goslings too! Perfect way to spend a gorgous, sunny day. ||May 7, 2019
strategic2020||40||I went on a beautiful spring day - with sun after some rainy days and it was as if the entire park was exploding with people, flowers, green and a fresh look at the year. I walked from one end to the other - and ate here too. Very lovely park. Flowers are well tended.||May 7, 2019

kellyc0llins||50||A must see if your visiting London really nice park with lots to do and see with the kids, a nice chill away from the hustle and bustle of the city.||May 7, 2019
mobydick-tc||40||Last week the weather was just great in London, sun shining in glory and temperature moderate cool to warm with light breeze. A perfect setup to visit this royal park.A walk in Hyde Park is a different experience to that which visitors to the capital expect in London. I started from the Marble Arch end and finished by the Lady Diana memorial. Usually I am not much of a walker who enjoy city walk, but this was not a city walk at all and I made the very most of the lush greens all around me with birds singing down the tall trees and the ducks and swans in the Serpent and clear blue sky above. I was in a different world...so peaceful and welcoming. It was a long walk but I was in awe of this nature's gift to Londoners.Highly recommend visitors to make sure to spare couple of hours for this beautiful park at leisure without the rushing. At the end of the visit you will feel totally rejuvenated.||May 7, 2019

zeina348||50||This park is wonderful with many things to do. There is the Diana memorial for children to play and slash around the stream in. You can picnic on the vast green grass. You can cycle, roller skate or skate board along the lake. Dining is offered at the surpentine cafe with a great view of the boating lake. You can hire boats for either half an hour or an hour long duration. There are both peddling or rowing boats. There is also another cafe across the lake on the other side of the surpentine cafe. Hyde park is always enjoyable both for kids and adults alike.||May 7, 2019

Erik_T_Viking68||50||Take time in any visit to London to switch off and return to nature and quiet. Hyde park and big and you can lose yourself by the serpentine on a deckchair or on the many paths, watching the wide range of people and life go by.There are many things to see. The historical - Albert memorial, statues, rose gardens, rotten row and speakers and Hyde park corners. But also the stunning Diana memorial fountain, serpentine, Diana playground and royal palaces.This is a place to savour the beauty of nature and of history. Take time to stop and watch in a busy day.||May 6, 2019

Nikhil G||50||Hyde park big water pond in front of Kesington Palace is known as Grand Basin has an amazing history which can only be heard if you make your visit to Kesington palace. Hyde Park has never a deserted view and you will always find people around, cycling, skating, kids runnning around, and loads of tourists clicking multiple photos which will be later sorted and the best ones will make way to social media portals.The Hyde park also provide a space for yourself if you are a sole traveller to this place.I loved this space in the heart of the city.||May 6, 2019
LennartW66||50||Best thing to do is feeding the squirrels. They are careful and grab the nuts right out of the hand. They really liked almonds, saltfree of course. you find them in any saintsbury local. make shure the are natural.We found the squirrels just south of the Diana memorial parkinglot.||May 5, 2019
Lilstarz91||50||Been here many times but first time with our 2 year old.We came in from the south Kensington part. As we entered you have an Albert memorial.The part we walked was heading to Hyde park corner. It was a nice walk with a cafe as you walk in. There is a path for horses and we were fortunate enough to see two coming along which our son loved.He enjoyed the wide spaces and collecting sticks and seeing others play football.As we got near the lake there was a small playground and a place to grab some food and a drink.Loads of benches along the lake with ducks and people on the peddle boats. There is another larger cafe area with loads of seating again serving food and drinks. You need a whole day to actually go the whole way round the park and see other features of it.||May 5, 2019
Martyn C||50||This place is so peaceful considering its in the middle of London, couple that with the good weather we had over Easter and a great way to spend an hour or two.||May 5, 2019

Paradise374790||40||Went through Hyde Park on a wonderful clear day, from Mable Arch right through to Kensington Palace end. Really enjoyed the walk and surrounds, but the food on offer in the park was ridiculously expense - pathetic icecream scoop that filled only half the cup for 6 pounds! joke. And the beggers were very very persistent and off putting, not much fun for tourists.||May 4, 2019
Canada2see||50||The gardens were a feast for the eyes and your nose was treated to all the fragrances' from the flowers. The buds on the trees were opening up. So glad we strolled through the park. ||May 3, 2019
sfc1969||50||Visited Hyde park and took the rowing boats out for 30 minutes life jackets suppliedFriendly staff who gave good tips on rowing techniques Didn’t take long to get going Lake is perfect and there is ample space for everyone even on a busy day when the sun shines Well worth taking the boats out ||May 3, 2019
Phantasy||50||We walked into the park in the early morniny at the NW end and viewed Kensington Palace. We then walked through this magnificent park, past the round pond and on to the Serpentine and then the Diana Fountain which was beautiful. We exited across Rotten Row and into Knightsbrige. A lovely experience on a bright sunny morning.||May 3, 2019
Lexibees||50||I'm rating Hyde Park 5/5 - because it's beautiful!I'm rating Ultimate Bar Tickets at BST 1/5. Here's what their marketing materials SHOULD read (wish I'd known before I parted with the cash): Entrance to The Ultimate Bar for the day to relax in style (relax if sitting on the grass is your type of thing – in fact, bring your own rug) Only get a seat if you are the first 40 people to arrive, otherwise you really are on the grass we’re afraid (I mean, don’t tell us you actually expected somewhere to sit down for £500 a pop!?) Arrive to a Welcome Glass of Champagne (oh no sorry, it looks and sounds like champagne, but we are not expecting any of our guests to have a high enough IQ to actually notice, oh and we do have a margin to stick to you know) Complimentary Bar serving a range (this would usually mean a variety of choices, but not here we’re afraid) of quality (dubious –that margin thing again) warm wine (but only if you if you like 1 type of wine), warm beer and limited warm spirits. We don’t anticipate a British summer to ever actually be warm, so cut costs on the fridges and ice(when would you expect either in a bar after all, especially The ULTIMATE Bar) Commemorative VIP Laminate and Lanyard/Wristband, worth approximately 3 quid Access to VIP Summer Garden (an exclusive area offering VIP bars that you’ll never go to because why would you pay again, premium food outlets with long queues, additional comfortable seating which you WILL NEED as seats in the Ultimate bar will likely already be bagsy’d by the same tourists who put down towels by the pool at your recent budget European hotel break, separate restroom facilities –these WILL come in especially handy) Enjoy a complimentary choice of Premium Food Offerings VIP Garden (activated by a voucher that will cover the cost of a burger, but you’ll be digging into to your pocket again if you actually want the fries to go with it) Complimentary British Summer Time T-Shirt (if you prefer one that’s actually cheaper on the day, tough luck you get the gold one–looks especially ‘disco’ on grown men) Dedicated Entrance -With Entry to the event up to 1 hour before the main gates open (manned by jobsworth security staff, who will send you to the ‘correct queue’ 1 step away, even if there is absolutely nobody else waiting just to make a point –now there’s a first impression for you!) Commemorative Ticket Wallet (actually included in the 3 quid lanyard/wristband package above, but we’ll list more things to make it feel like you’re getting loads thrown in) Itinerary and tickets in advance (as you would hope –something has to save this) We won’t ask you for feedback afterwards, because we don’t actually care what you think. We also know that the next unsuspecting person who wants to treat their friend or loved one to a special day or evening out, will be sucked in by our false promises and ultimately underwhelmed by their experience too, but so what, and so it goes on…You may think I sound bitter for the experience, but above is an accurate reflection on the day sadly reiterated by everyone we spoke to. There was disappointment all round.I did try to contact the owner of the Ultimate Bar with my comments after the event, but they refused to respond. As such, I thought my full review here might help some others out.By all means get the summertime garden tickets, but don't bother with the Ultimate Bar until they up their game.||May 2, 2019
Cancan2418||50||We love going to Hyde park as a family. There is plenty to do with the children like the fountains, Princess Diana playground as well as the peddlo's. It's even great for an evening stroll||May 1, 2019
Micky270566||50||Never realized how big Hyde Park was. Started at Speakers Corner in lovely warm sunshine and enjoyed the lovely flowers and bird life.||May 1, 2019
S17London||40||On my last walk through Hyde Park (often used as a route from A-B rather than a destination itself) I enjoyed the people watching as much as the wildlife! It's always amusing to wander through and stroll down Rotten Row. The park attracts everyone from serious exercisers to families with kids on tricycles and strolling couples. ||May 1, 2019
Luisa170||50||We visited here on the Easter Monday for a day out in London. We walked around Hyde park taking in the lovely views and fresh air and walked down to the peddle boats. We got tickets and got straight into the boat. The weather was brilliant and it was so nice just peddling around the lake. At midday they did the gun salute and we listened to it whilst we were on the boat. The whole place was silent and the cannons fired echoed for miles. When we got off of the boats there was a very long queue to get tickets for the boats so we went at the right time! We then got an ice cream and continued to walk around Hyde park. It was a lovely morning walking through and experiencing Hyde park and it’s lovely even to just sit on the grass and relax ||April 29, 2019
daniela1234224||50||Just a beautiful place to walk around. From the geese to the swans, the trees to the flowers, the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain to the friendly squirrels - so much to see & enjoy! ||April 29, 2019
YJ A||50||You can do just about anything here - whether you want to relax or play games on the grass, have a nice walk or a run, exercise a dog, ride a horse, ride a bike, hire a boat, see some art, see a variety of birds - all of this is possible! There are also plenty of great places to get a coffee, a pizza or an ice cream!||April 29, 2019
Nabiihah||40||We went there for Easter bank holiday. The park is huge with lots of places to discover and few activities to do. However the fresh blooms is a must see at this time of year!||April 29, 2019
ATBrighton||50||Hyde Park doesn’t disappoint what a wonderful London Park. It was very busy on bank holiday but absolutely beautiful place to people watch, take a stroll, hire a boat, take a paddle in Diana’s fountain area.||April 28, 2019
BrianB32931||50||I love everything about Hyde Park. I start my days with a 7k run round the park.. I will typically use the park for a walk or to cut thru to other parts of the area.||April 28, 2019
ntalabany||50||There is something for everybody in Hyde Park. I never tire of walking, cycling or jogging through it. Early mornings in Spring are my absolute favourite time but icy clear winter days and hot Summer nights have their own beauty here. At this time of the year you have a chance to watch Horseguards practicing their parade skills on Rotten Row in full dress uniform for the upcoming Trooping the Colours.Or you could listen to the rants and ravings of one of those courageous people taking their views to the public at Speakers Corner between 2pm and 5pm on a Sunday. Or pop into one of the two art galleries to add a bit of extra culture to the experience of strolling through what used to be a hunting ground of kings and is now dotted with various pieces of art ranging from centuries old sculptures to contemporary installations (Christo’s Mastaba on the Serpentine was amazing!). It is also worthwhile checking out the annually changing Pavillion. Or you could just stroll through the Rose garden and enjoy the antics of the hundreds of grey squirrels and green parakeets, both species immigrants to the United Kingdom but now firm local favourites with all visitors. Herons, ducks, geese and swans also make a lively natural distraction while walking around the Serpentine.You can spend a morning or a day in Hyde Park and there will always be something new to discover. I have not even mentioned the growing number of park events, challenges and runs which can attract huge crowds (10k charity runs seem to sprout like mushrooms) and actually tend to spoil my experience of Hyde Parks.For your personal needs there are quite a few food and drink refreshment points dotted around the park. Be prepared for overpriced hot and cold beverages though as well as having to pay 20 pennies when you need to ‘spent a penny’. This is a Royal Park after all.||April 27, 2019
masndas||50||Brilliant to let 6 kids aged 4-12 to run steam of in open space to relax and recharge from the bustle of the city ||April 27, 2019
mgscubadivers2||50||Great walking trails, water area's with birds, very clean and the flowers were just starting to bloom. Very peaceful.||April 26, 2019
pumpkinj2017||50||Everyone knows about Hyde Park, but very few take the time on a short London trip to stroll slowly and absorb its beauty and elegance. You see water, trees, flowers from a different perspective when you are in person and not reading about it in a book. Reflect and enjoy what Victorian London was like when people met for secret assignations in Hyde Park, sat and gossiped and the nannies watched their children play in clean air.||April 26, 2019
Lisa J||50||Visited London on a weekend coach break and spent 3 hours wandering the park before we went to the hotel. SO much to see - the Serpentine, different statues and memorials, plenty of space to just sit & chill out. Even in 3 hours we only managed to walk around a small portion of the park. A great place to lose yourself for a day or two!||April 26, 2019
Carolswe||50||Nothing more than a Good spot of nature in London.Just be careful cause in every where there are scammers trying to steal your money with games.||April 26, 2019
NY_Guy_Traveling||50||I had some time before meeting up with my family, so I took a walk through the eastern half of Hyde Park. It was beautiful. I walked by the lake for a while before heading over to one of the paths. The park is huge, so even though there were a ton of people, I never felt crowded. There is so much to see in London, I tend to rush around from place to place. It's great to tone it down for an hour or two and walk through a beautiful space. ||April 25, 2019
vladhotshot||50||Hyde Park has a lot to offer during Spring. The lake is beautiful and the children can run around and use their energy. I find that the park is well organised and there are plenty of things to do for all ages.||April 25, 2019
MaKai M||50||We couldn't sleep being so jet lagged, so at 5 AM we headed out to Hyde Park. We had an early morning photo shoot and it was amazing. There was no one there. I find if I do things first thing in the morning I stand a better chance of their not being a big crowd. It's a great walk and the park itself is beautiful. ||April 25, 2019
michaeltC2091IE||50||Walking, biking, picnic, boating, feeding the birds, go for a run, take in the scenery. It’s a big park, which must be a god send to the locals. Paddington station to Knightsbridge can be walked with no problem to take in the view. Just a lovely place to relax. Mike||April 25, 2019
S6046UUsteves||40||We got up early to walk in Hyde Park which is beautiful and deceptively large (Americans think NYCs Central Park). Beautiful gardens and lots of people out early walking, running , biking and riding horses ( pleasant surprise). ||April 24, 2019
sea2la007||50||We stayed at Royal Lancaster Hotel and we enjoyed our walks through the park. Highly recommend check out the ringed-neck parkeets at Kensington Garden area ( just south of Lancaster Gate). My daughter enjoyed feeding the parkeets. Also there is Peter Pan statue and QRC and you can hear a story. Very lovely park and safe to walk around.||April 24, 2019
Linda S||50||Spent a gorgeous Saturday afternoon with my granddaughter in the Princess Diana Memorial Playground in a corner of Hyde Park. What an absolutely delightful place! Plenty of seating and shade, and all sorts of room for kids to enjoy themselves.||April 24, 2019
jules3817||40||A large park with plenty of wildlife including the parrots, who are all happy to eat from your hand.Clean and tidy.||April 24, 2019
LisaRooney9||50||Hyde park is a great day if its nice outside. You have the pedal boats, restaurants, or take your own food and drink and enjoy the park.||April 24, 2019
MeChasingDreams||50||Beautiful and really amazing park. I will recommend that you visit the Diana memorial, the Vittoria Garden, a place next to Peter Pan statue where you can feed the birds!!!||April 24, 2019
kliskp||50||Beautiful big park that takes hours to walk through. A lot of people during hot days. Sit in the grass and enjoy the weather. A few shops selling ice cream and waffles. ||April 23, 2019
hiltoncharlie||50||Under one fabulous big roof. One of the best stores in the world for luxury goods, plus a very wide range of exceptional quality everyday items. Think sheets, towels, white goods, home alliances - fantastic selection at reasonable prices. Expect to pay between 300-3,000 for a duvet. 400-2000 for a set of sheets. They are excellent and we sleep peacefully everyday.||April 23, 2019
kwocka||40||Lovely to drive through and walk through, quite large and extensive and plenty to see. So much to do and see in Hyde Park, and drive around it and through it, quite an experience||April 23, 2019
myaplatt1||40||Huge park walked to Kensington, great place when weather is good even saw the gun Salute excellent show, peaceful place despite loads of people||April 23, 2019
Clrntrbl||50||Hyde Park is gorgeous in the spring, everything is blooming and there are so many great places to sit and watch people, birds, and plants. There are Santander bicycles available for rent around the edges and a sprinkling of Lime bikes as well. We rented Lime bikes because we’ve never tried them before and they were a total blast to ride around the park!There is also a lovely long pond with boat rentals, both row boats and peddle boats, with ducks and swans swimming all around. Don’t miss this gorgeous green space in the heart of London. ||April 22, 2019
bellyeats||40||Visited on Easter Weekend- super sunny weather which meant one thing- long queues and lots of people everywhere. We wanted to go on the boating lake but the queues were so long. Fortunately we wanted the rowing boats which meant a shorter wait than the pedalos. Short walk over to Harvey Nichols or Harrods for some post strolling drinks.||April 22, 2019
vvpvlasic||50||Impressed with the park. Recommend to enter in front of the Kennington palace, walk thru the garden, have snack/drink in front of it, walk thru the park and get to princess Di memorial fountain. Amazing stroll. Allow 1.5hr. Enjoy!||April 21, 2019
Pakre59||50||Hired a punch bike and cycled around London to many places... Hyde Park is fabulous - take a picnic.||April 21, 2019
Champions N||40||Too many people in this park, and i can understand why: beautiful and spatious, with a big lake and boats for fun... the down side of it is the huge queues for everything, including ice creams||April 21, 2019
roseemcd||40||Was such an awesome park and to see Kensington Palace was awesome, its a beautiful park in the city so relaxing watching all the Queens swans||April 21, 2019
Sailesh D||50||Huge park to go to meet friends,play and rest. Excellent Serpentine lake to sit and watch. Skaters,cyclyist love it. Early morning walkers a dream. Summer concerts, winter Wonderland, beautifully done. Can never get bore in this place. Easy place to find it.||April 21, 2019
christophermO3624HZ||50||This park was very near our Airbnb for a one week stay and ended up serving us many times. While technically Kensington Gardens, the Princess Diana playground was an amazing place for the kids to play. Bike rental was available within the park as well as paddle boats. The Princess Diana Memorial Fountain is filled with life as kids were in running through it in all levels of clothing. Biking through the park using Fat Tire Bike Tours was beautiful. People congregated on the grassy areas or were seen walking the many paths. A great place to go to after a long day of being a tourist in the busy city.||April 20, 2019
Stefan T||40||Good walk on a nice weather day to visit Princess' Diana memorial. This is a good connection between the Buckingham Palace and Marble Arch (20-30 min. walk) ||April 20, 2019
327gemmap||50||Great walk with family and friends. Been to London a few times and never walked around parks. This was a welcome break from the city noise. Shame about the protesters!||April 20, 2019
unalomew||50||The best place to top up your positive energy. We love kids playground (pirate ship theme), the lake and the ducks!.||April 19, 2019
carlm729||50||Lovely park in Central London, beautifully landscaped and very varied. Great place to ride a bike, go for a walk, row a boat or just sit and enjoy some peace and life in what is such a hectic place like London||April 19, 2019
C L||50||One of London's greatest assets is its parks. Once inside, you feel like you are far from the city. Yet, all the people walking around are from everywhere in the world. Step in once and you will keep returning. Great for a pedalo on the water with friends or family in the summer. And there's art at the Serpentine's Gallery.||April 19, 2019
egmum||50||Just perfect ❤️... interesting and variable areas, great facilities although remember your 50p if you are likely to need the loo.. full of Londoners and visitors and used well all year round. The gardeners do a splendid job of keeping it looking gorgeous all year round. Lots of dogs, occasional horses & loads of swans on the Serpentine. Love this park .. you see something different every time you walk in it. ||April 18, 2019
Dreamer710304||50||The park is perfect for leisure and relaxation. It is very nice. You can ride a bike and boat trip there.||April 18, 2019
anawriting||50||By far, one of the best thing to see in London. The lake, the landscape, the quiet... It is all amazing, especially on a sunny day.||April 18, 2019
LeeAnn58||50||We walked through Hyde Park for several hours. There is so much to see and it is free. There are many monuments and statues and Speakers corner with significant historical value. The Queens gate just outside the park and Marble Arch are incorporated in your wandering. Lady Diana’s walk was truly spectacular with garden beds full of flowers and tulips. The Rose Garden impeccable kept. There are quaint houses and an old building housing the Metropolitan Police. The Serpentine Lake is beautiful with water activities and lots of people watching can be done. Have an ice cream or coffee, hire a sun lounge and watch the wildlife. There are bicycle to hire as well. The park was busy as the weather was warm. A tranquil place amidst a very busy city. AND IT IS FREE. ||April 17, 2019
just r||40||Loved the energy and peaceful protests. Hoping the R family steps up to the plate and contributes everything, selflessly, for this real cause.||April 17, 2019
Stacyreviews||50||I was here before on a solo trip and it was a wonderful place to go and relax with a picnic. Everything is pretty expensive in london so taking a day to brin your own lunch and people watch was a nice break. We passed by in march but the rain kept us from spending much time||April 17, 2019
Dan L||50||A beauriful park to walk around and people watch. The grounds are kept up and easy to navigate. Spend 30 minutes there, you will not be sorry.||April 17, 2019
farruquino||50||Perfect oasis in the middle of London to exercise with the feeling of being immersed in some of the best nature has to offer.||April 16, 2019
Herb_Silverman||50||It is a very pretty park to walk through and spend some time in. On the Kensington side is Kensington Palace which is really worhtwhile to take a tour through.||April 15, 2019
olivierengelaere||20||This wednesday 10th april 2019 I've been robbed in Hyde park. I rented a Santander bike and 5 minutes later I was surrounder by a group of young people who stole my iphone and my ear pods. I called the Police who can't do anything for me. Then I learned the park is not covered by CCTV.||April 15, 2019
alrth||50||Nice place to have a walk through, considering how many people were there, it was very calm and peaceful. Just be wary of cyclists and joggers. ||April 15, 2019
yaseengani||50||A beautiful park to chill out after a walk to the palace and also a worth visiting Princess Diana memorial. Highly recommended if you are with a group of friends or family for afternoon snacks, games and chat.||April 15, 2019
Mr_Eastwoods||50||Beautiful, quite place in the heart of London. Very nice place to take a walk in a good weather day. Have to sit down on the lake side and have a cup of coffee, or afternoon British tea! ||April 15, 2019
vodkatrain_1001Trips||50||Hyde Park is for sure one of London’s most beautiful parks and tourist attraction at the same time.Nice for a break and lovely to watch everything going on there!||April 15, 2019
John C||50||We stayed quite close to Hyde park, great to walk around and look at all the birds, some of them are nearly tame especially the Parakeets which you can hand feed.||April 15, 2019
Awesomeworld2see||50||This is a beautiful park,leading in different directions and well signposted.Its huge and while walking I encountered squirrels which were absolutely gorgeous.I really wish I had taken food to feed them.You have to pay to use the toilets in the park so make sure you take some small coins.||April 15, 2019
RoamingBrenda||50||There are so many wonderful areas in Hyde Park from the Italian Gardens to the Serpentine, to the wild grass lands and meadow. ||April 14, 2019
GentlemanJonny||50||Through recommend for the pedal boats or a run around the perimeter which is beautiful in the summertime. Essential for locals and worth a stop as a tourist too!||April 14, 2019
Lois S||50||In the center of the city you forget that you are in London. Nature, clean air, calm, all you need to have a break!||April 14, 2019
VikkiK91||50||We love to visit Hyde Park and ride the bicycles around the park. It is the only royal park which has more than one large cycling lane and it is relaxing to cycle past the Serpentine on a sunny day. ||April 14, 2019
RossHendersonDJ||50||great walk or cycle and lots to see, there are also a few places to grab a drink or pizza along the way! the lake has a few activies for families too so a nice day out ||April 14, 2019
762elisabethj||40||Had a morning run around the park, was approximately 8 km. Lots of things to see: cherry blossom trees, different birds, some squirrels, even met two people riding horses. Nice and tidy.||April 14, 2019
953jatina||50||The Hyde Park is such a peaceful walk in the middle of lush greenery that’s its so refreshing and one never gets tired of being here again and again. I prefer Hyde Park over St James Park or the other side facing Buckingham Palace as it’s never so crowded and truly a peaceful walking experience. ||April 13, 2019
Barbara B||50||Very quiet when we walked around after walking around central London gardeners doing a very good job of keeping it tidy||April 13, 2019
Caroline R||50||If you can get into a guided tour on fot (walks are available in groups) and someone can take you to the interesting parts of the park, it would be much better. Walking on your own or with friends or family is also quite fun. From time to time, there is a fair in the summer and it is a lovely opportunity to mingle with people and have some healthy fun. Kids love it. I like to go on long walks and then back. Bus stops are available eary couple of blocks so if you get tired you can hop on and/or hop off a local bus to get to your hotel or B&B or wherever you are staying with family or friends. It is nicer in May as it tends to rain a lot in April. Even in the rain though it is beautiful and one all of a sudden starts singing 'I am dancing in the rain...' Hope you love it as much as did and still do. Thanks.||April 13, 2019
Marie H||50||Beautiful park ...lovely large lake with many swans .geese and ducks ...Princess Diana's memorial and Princess Diana's children's play area ..a beautiful walk to Kensington Palace with a gorgeous tea room. ||April 13, 2019
parisusan||50||I took a detour through the south side of Hyde park on my way to the theatre. The park is beautifully planted with many varieties of plants and flowers. I walked by the unique Princess Diana Memorial Fountain which is a large circle of moving water. I was delighted by the variety of water fowl and their chicks.I was pressed for time but you could easily spend more time enjoying the various areas this park has to offer.||April 13, 2019
B8645YLdavida||50||Kensington Palace and Gardens, The Serpentine, Diana Memorials, The Albert Memorial, The Serpentine...What more could you wish for on a sunny day in London...||April 13, 2019
AnastasiaP_travel||50||There are so many places to explore - Italian gardens, the round pond, Albert's memorial, Diana's memorial, the Rose garden. The Serpentine cafes get crowded, especially in the summer months, but it's lovely to walk along during sunset hours. There are Sunday yoga classes during the summer, in the Kensington Gardens part. I used to live 10 mins walk from Hyde Park, and it will always be one of my favourite places in London!||April 13, 2019
Catherine J||50||One of the best parks I have visited globally. On a sunny day or even during autumn, a very chillaxing place ||April 13, 2019
bordercollie10||50||Lovely clean park. Plenty of wildlife to see and feed. Open space. Ample toilets including disabled facilities. Downside is the price of food and drinks. Advisable to take your own. Easy reach of Kensington Gardens and the Princess Diana Fountain is well worth a visit.||April 13, 2019
MrsV_00||50||If the sun is shining in London, you want to be outside enjoying it, and you can easily do that at Hyde Park (and all the royal parks for that matter). It doesn't matter if you are young / old, travelling solo, with friends / family, have young children or teens ... there's something everyone will enjoy. Whats even better is it is free! They say you can't leave your front door without spending money in London, so who wouldn't want to be able to enjoy a free day out (note: not everything in the park is free). Some things you can check out include:* The Rose Garden* Speaker's Corner* Princess Diana Memorial fountain* Hyde park playground* Boat on the Serpentine* Check out the wildlife* Enjoy the bars and cafes there* Or you can enjoy some sport (take a ball, your roller blades ... whatever you fancy), or visit the tennis and sport centre. Tips:* Always try to use the parks as a walk through to your destination. Why sit on a bus or tube when you can walk through this beautiful park on your way somewhere?* If it is a beautiful day, try to visit a load of the places listed above. You really can make a day of it. * There are some great events run at Hyde park from concerts to Winter wonderland giving you other reasons to visit.||April 13, 2019
nadia516||50||What a wonderful place in the heart of the city. You can eat there, go boating on the serpentine & take the little ones to the Princess playground. A great day out.||April 13, 2019
KonaBear81||50||We were here for spring. The Parks were full of beautiful tulips and swan, Canadian geese, and the beautiful waterfall in honor of Lady Di. Perfect place to work out, or stroll and take in the beauty.||April 13, 2019
jordanf792||50||We went for a morning run from our hotel and it was amazing. As far as running goes, we didn't even scratch the surface with all the trails winding through. I could see spending the whole afternoon here looking at Kensington, walk around the pond/lake and having a picnic lunch, looking at landscaping, etc.||April 13, 2019
Pinkertonx||50||We walked from Leicester Square through St. James' Park, through Green Park and into Hyde Park up to the cafe by the lake. Here we stopped for a coffee and to wait for the rain to ease. Then, we were off again, only to be caught in a hailstorm, so we diverted across the bridge to the Albert Hall. Even though we were wet, we thoroughly enjoyed our time.||April 12, 2019
stud m||50||everytime i come with my family in london, we have to walk every morning in hyde park. Absolutely the gem of london! cannot live without it here!!||April 11, 2019
CSItraveller||50||If you're transiting from the top of Oxford street and it's noisy shopping area to Knightsbridge or Kensington, don't take the bus or Underground - instead walk across Hyde Park. The fresh air, relative quiet and open paths will refresh your system. North to south, or vice versa, stop off at the Serpentine to chat to a swan, and let your mind slow. Look out for the riders that use the bridle paths, if you're on foot. If you're driving through the park - there is no stopping on the road that intersects Hyde Park, this is a through road. Park up in a designated car park and look, don't hold up the traffic. ||April 11, 2019
S4512OQdonnae||50||Lovely park for walking around in - it was very close to my hotel, and the weather was beautiful while I was in London, so I walked through and around the paths/trails as much as I could.||April 11, 2019
katiemarie1042||40||Took the hop on hop off bus to Hyde Park. It is HUGE. Rental bikes were available and we rode them all over the park. Be sure to see the Albert Memorial, and if you go on a Sunday go up to the northeast corner to Speakers corner where you will find all kinds of people talking about- well anything. There is also a memorial to Princess Diana which is quite lovely. Beautiful tranquil park right in the middle of London We loved it||April 11, 2019
Stephen S||40||We didn't have but about an hour to visit the park and it is absolutely huge so we only saw a small portion of this historic park. We will go back one day walk through the whole park. I can see how they hold the massive crowds for concerts, etc.||April 11, 2019
Jamojam55||50||This is still an Iconic Park with attractions for all the family. Always enjoy exploring the magnitude of space right in good proximity to the amazing historical sites of London Quite close to the Palace and The IconicWar Memorials. Keep exploring and dreaming and meeting people. ||April 11, 2019
Deee01||40||Great location to chill, ride bikes, ride boats (a little expensive but worth it), and explore the area. only thing is food and snacks around here are TOURIST PRICE!!! ||April 10, 2019

Somewhere_in_Spain||50||Just been walking across Hyde Park, absolutely lovely today with clear blue skies some spring warmth. The Serpentine is looking especially reflective of the blue sky, Perfect day for it. Lovely park right in the middle of London. You could forget you were in a big city. There's been a park on this sight since 1637.||April 10, 2019

Takingeachroad||50||We happened upon Hyde Park as we were walking. We had such a fantastic time feeding the birds and the squirrels. It was hard to leave this beautiful park. I wish we would have had more time to just sit and enjoy it all.||April 4, 2019

892terries||50||We arranged to take the children 12 and 10 to winter wonderland for the day ..the whole set up was totally amazing 10 stars.. We booked Peter pan experience..was great to watch and good value for money.. we also booked and played for the snowman experience.. what a total let down.. the biggest waste of money I've spent in 4 years .. it's totally awful and really falsely advertised... DONT BOOK THIS ||April 4, 2019

ada2001||50||With s few hours time, it’s a pleasant break from the busy city life. Strolling into Hyde Park without a specific destination, I found the Serpentine and surrounding areas as the immediate attraction.The stretch of waters with its water birds, plants, picturesque scenery gave me pleasant memories, despite wet and chilly weather in the absence of sunshine!||April 4, 2019

Chance N||50||This place is beautiful and grand with boat rentals, walking paths, and ball parks. But the Swans in love, and the little duckling following thier mother are priceless. Check out the gallery in the park and the extravagent memorial that Queen Victoria had built for her consort Prince Albert.||April 2, 2019
Nicholas F||40||Went Saturday 30th March 2019 on our way to the Albert Hall.This is a very nice park with the Serpentine in it, a nice gallery and plenty of flowers, trees and shrubs to keep you occupied if you like that sort of thing.Worth a visit if you get the chance, ideal if you fancy a walk to or from the Albert Hall.||April 2, 2019

ppjkis||50||Hyde Park is a huge park in the middle of London which has a lake, various sculptures, a palace, ie Kensington Palace, various cafes. Once you step in to the park from the hustle & bustle of the city, it’s almost if your in another world. You can take your own picnic or snack & it’s also open until late. The greatest thing about it, is that it’s totally free. You can arrive when you want to & stay for the whole day & it hasn’t cost you a bean, apart from drinks & snacks etc. It’s a must if you are in the London & have some hours to spare.||March 27, 2019
ManxmikeH||50||A very pleasant walk or stroll through Hyde Park where there are statues, sculptures and of course Kensington Palace to see, with a walk along the Serpentine to one of the cafe's is a must.||March 27, 2019

flaneur40||50||This park has a elongated, river-like pond called The Serpentine and along it are sculptures as varied as Henry Moore and Peter Pan. There is also a Gallery called The Serpentine (2 of them actually) and tons of green grass. To the south is the Albert Memorial and exit to Kensington South and the Victoria & Albert Museum, to the west is Kensington Palace and NW is exit to Notting Hill. Not sure where Hyde Park becomes Kensington Gardens, but they are technically the same mass of land split sort of by the Serpentine. To the NE is Marble Arch and Speakers' Corner leading to Oxford High Street and Selfridge's ||March 25, 2019
PHE22||40||The centre piece of Hyde park is this beautiful lake. It offers such a variety of entertainment from boating to just being peaceful. ||March 25, 2019

834davee||50||Sitting in the middle of London, this park is a great diversion from the hustle and bustle of London. Many trails throughout the park to explore the gardens, wildlife, and lakes. Stop by and see the Diana Memorial Fountain. Several places to stop and take a break with food and drink throughout the park. Well worth an hour or two for a quiet afternoon walk.||March 23, 2019
opossumd||40||Together with Kensington Gardens - from which it is separated by West Carriage Drive, Hyde Park sits in the middle of London, a large green lung always busy with people seeking relaxation and practising their favourite activities - walking, jogging, rowing, cycling, horse riding, ball games, and so on. Always pleasant to spend time in.||March 23, 2019
Hugh J||50||This new species have set up a colony in Hyde Park & Kensington Palace Gardens.They are very bold & feed from your hand.Boris bikes are also good to hire in this area.||March 20, 2019
Scottie96||40||We drive through the park on our way to our destination. I know I is a large park but I did not feel the relaxed feeling I usually would at a large green space. I would recommend that you do some research on what it has to offer before you plan a visit as there may be a lot more to it that what we saw. One positive is that it is very easy to access from The Marble Arch subway station. ||March 20, 2019
LISAMIA66||50||Spent a couple of hours wandering this beautiful park. Gardens kept to perfection, clean and a great spot to sit.||March 20, 2019

823milend||40||The second best park (after the St. James's), but this one is not so Romantic and serene. Nevertheless, a good walk, a good Serpentine lake and nice flower beds at places. Amazing entrance from the Green Park corner.||March 20, 2019
Mark W||50||You are able to escape the normal hustle and bustle of London in Hyde Park. When the suns out it's a perfect place to go and be at one with nature.||March 20, 2019
James J||40||I enjoy walking in parks but the main reason I return here in December is for the Winter Festical just off speakers cornor. Kenington Place is located at the west end and it should be seen. Regretfully most of the park is non-discrept.||March 19, 2019
James C||30||Love the serpentine and amazing walk from Kensington High Street to Park Lane although the cafes are a little expensive so better to take a picnic etc.||March 19, 2019
Deb J||40||This is probably the busiest of London’s parks but still worth a visit, the Serpentine is the focal point but there are other walks and sights to see, even though it is busy, some quiet spots can still be found. A lovely way to spend a sunny afternoon.||March 19, 2019
EmB1111||50||One of the greatest inner cities park. It is big (round trip is 7.5 kms including kensington gardens and you can inner loops to double it), it has plenty to do (wildlife, water activities at the serpentine, kids playgrounds including lady diana’s, kids swimming pool and you can even swim in the Serpentine throughput the year .... i run there at least once a week and never get bored of it. Anyone coming to london should visit it.||March 19, 2019
Markku K||40||beautiful park with lots of birds and for example Diana monument (as well as play park). The park is big and there is a lot to walk, the land is flat so everyone can move well. At the edge of the park you will find the Kensigton Palace as well as the Technical Museum and, of course, the Royal Palace from the other end.||March 19, 2019

GuyFromTheSix||40||The park is huge with lots of trees. There are lots of wildlife at the waterfront. A walk in this quiet park in a busy city is both peaceful and refreshing.||March 17, 2019
macedonboy||50||One of the best parks in London as you'd expect given that it's in a very wealthy area of the city and it's proximity to Buckingham Palace. The park is pretty big with lots of paved walkways. Inside and around the park are lots of memorials and monuments, and if you're ever around the park on a Sunday, then definitely go to Speaker's jCorner just to hear some crazy person talking, and talking about ... stuff.||March 16, 2019
ojw89||30||Take a bus if you plan on going quickly trough the park. It’s not super beautifull but the part with the small river is nice.||March 15, 2019
martakin||50||We were there in January. Kensington Palace is at one end, and the Wellington Arch is at the other. We walked from one end to the other, which was quite pleasant. There's a lake with lots of birds Plenty of trails for walking, running, or biking. Also great for kids||March 15, 2019
Sara_Frazier||50||Hyde Park is one of the best places to spend a sunny afternoon in London. Sit and people (or dog) watch, have a picnic or stroll by Kensington Palace.||March 14, 2019
hwhy30||50||nice walk with the dogs would be better in the summer but thats just because id like to stop and have a picnic||March 14, 2019

PeterHa1||40||Different from Central Park in NYC. relatively flat and surrouned by history. Cut through there to get to Churchill War Museum. Plenty to see and appreciate.||March 13, 2019
ShaunyToms||50||Came here with my family to watch Bruno Mars Last year as he was the main act one of the nights. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised at how it had all been put together and was even more surprised when I went to the bathroom as it makes such a difference to actually be able to go to a proper toilet in a festival instead of a portaloo. The queue for drinks was long as you would expect but I found the prices to be fairly reasonable and I met some really nice people that day . would highly recommend and will definitely be returning.||March 13, 2019
MrsShariP||40||This park is an absolutely beautiful feature for a city to have, even if you only ever get to experience it en route to another location. Here you can escape the hustle and bustle of the city and have a lovely picnic, walk your dog or visit one of the many monuments and features the park has to offer... even visit Kensington Palace. Highly worth a visit.||March 13, 2019
Jacquie J||50||For tourists and residents alike, Hyde Park offers some quiet time from Knightsbridge and Oxford Street! Sit by the Serpentine or take a walk towards Kensington Palace and walk out to find yourself in High Street Kensington. So put on your walking shoes and enjoy a day out and you will be surprised how much you can enjoy being in the fresh air yet still being able to visit the shops etc., whichever route you decide to take....||March 12, 2019
Maria R||50||Incredible experience! There are a lot of squirrels and green parrots that come to your hand if you have some food like fruits, and eat them on your hand. Beautiful nature and wildlife.||March 12, 2019
906mettea||50||Whenever i am in London , i try too make time for a walk in this park. It is a pub near Lancaster Gate, the Swan which is nice to make a stop after walking. ||March 11, 2019
_jjkledwards||50||Plenty of paths to walk down, and things to see. Italian Gardens were very good. If you cannot walk far choose a spot to visit, and plan your dropping off point be it by bus, tube, or taxi. Kensington Palace, and Cafe worth a visit.||March 11, 2019
mohzan||40||A must visit when you are in london. Also the kensinton gardens beside it. Plus the kensinton palace & princess diana memorial park. A 5 km jogging/ running/ cycling track. A large pond with swans, ducks n pigeons, a few squirels around too. The eastern side has a track for the Royal horse calvary to practice.||March 11, 2019
SmartDamo||40||This park is vast, my favourite part being Berties gift to Queen Vic, of the Italian Gardens, I haven't actually been in the Diana Memorial section, although this looks impressive.||March 11, 2019
KP11347||40||We walked through several parks on a sunny Saturday morning. Hyde Park was decently busy, but we had a lovely walk around the Serpentine. Some nice places to have coffee and there was already some colour in the gardens by the Hyde Park Corner entrance. The only negative was that at one point we were almost mown down by a cyclist travelling far too fast and without appreciation for pedestrians. It’s a park not a racetrack!||March 9, 2019
nhiltz||50||It was a beautiful day for shopping and walking about in Hyde Park!! Amazing monuments, bird life and greenery. I love that they have a sand trail for horseback riding!!!||March 8, 2019

StephenCr0ss||50||Crisp and cold but clear sky. Runners, walkers and horse riding. flowers in bloom. Monuments and places to sit and watch. Absolutely wonderful at 7am! Try it.||March 7, 2019
MiamariaV||50||Hyde Park is a must for when you're in London. Walking or cycling around the park is lovely, and they also have pedal and row boats for the lake in the middle of the park. There are some cafes/restaurants, but they're a little overpriced and always packed with people, so bringing a picnic and sitting down somewhere in the park might be nicer. ||March 7, 2019
ClaudioY8||50||Huge, beautiful and peaceful park located in the center area of London, you can see people jogging, dog walking, doing picnic, horse riding, and young couples sit on the bench chatting, very interesting place. There is a lake inside of the park, you can see many ducks, geese and swans around the lake shore.||March 7, 2019
Allsort7||50||A brilliant place to see and walk round, lots you can do and lots to see people doing, let alone having abit eto eat in the park or nearby cafe's, then you just walk out to see more of london, brilliant.||March 6, 2019

264judib||30||This area of London is beautiful and filled with nature. There are many types of wild ducks and birds. The Trumpet swans are gorgeous and quite friendly. They are not afraid of the masses of people who feed them. One down fall is the public washrooms are not free. There is a charge with a coin gate not sure what this tax is called. But most things have a tax in the city.||March 6, 2019
RebeccaSam1991||50||Great park for a Sunday walk. Many cafes around the park. Lots of bird and other cute animal. worth a visit||March 5, 2019

Andrewscotts||40||Random trip with the family lovely greenery nice clean park and the kids loved it was a bonus.Will surely return in the summer with the little ones again and hope swany the swan follows us around again for his bread||March 3, 2019
Ranu M||30||Sunday afternoon, We entered from Hyde Park Corner.Could not find a bench to sit on. Some of the grass area had been roped off for grass to grow back. Around the Serpentine, some parts were fenced off, maybe renovations going on. Roller Skaters were using all the walkways, so we had to be alert all the time as they skated past you. We decided to walk towards Speakers Corner at the top end as we hadn't been there for years. 2 groups were arguing about religion, which I am least interested in. Someone was filming the crowds, and I said I hadn't given them permission to film me, Videoman said this is the one part in whole country where Consent is not required.||March 3, 2019
AKARRR||50||As always we loved to visit Hyde Park when we visited London. It is good for everyone. It nice greenery park in the middle of the busy city. It is recommended to visit it in Weekdays and in the morning or in the afternoon. There are some cafes to have a cup of coffee if the weather os warm in Winter. ||March 3, 2019
MrPiky||40||This is an enormous park in central London. It has some very large flat open spaces which is fine for a walk or for hanging out on a hot summer day. But otherwise not that interesting to explore.But it does have some fit parts. There is Speakers Corner at the end by Marble Arch. There is a fun road strip that runs East to West through the middle where people to learn to roller skate and just hang out. There is The Serpentine Gallery in the centre and the Serpentine itself (a lake) in the centre also. There is Kensington Palace at the north-east corner. So plenty to see if you're going to this park anyway.||March 3, 2019
markhas||50||We were blessed with lovely sunshine and amazed at the array of birds and ducks, the flowers are just about to bloom||March 3, 2019

kaywhite90||40||It was awesome. So relaxing and calm. We did a great walk before breakfast, had porridge and tea at the little restaurant on the lake. A lot of very sporty people running and cycling and swimming. Many dogs. Ducks and swans in and on the lake.Definitely would do that again to get a little rest from the busy city around.||February 27, 2019
c_hill9982||50||One of the most attractive parks in Britain. A stunning walk whether it be a sunny day or crisp winter day. Immaculately maintained and plenty of space for kids to run around, enjoy a game of football or for anyone to relax and read a book. Also very popular with runners and there is room to ride a hire bike through too. There are watered areas too with various activities.Does have various attractions throughout the year; festivals, Winter Wonderland to name a couple. Not much beats getting an ice cream and taking a stroll through Hyde Park on a sunny summers day to escape the hustle and bustle of the city for a couple of hours.||February 26, 2019
Marietta T||50||Lovely Park to stroll around weather permitted when in London! Ideal place to ride a bike, walk aside the lake and enjoy some peace away from the bustle and hustle of the city!||February 26, 2019
Witbiz||50||Really nice park to go to, especially on a sunny day!Nice little cafes dotted around and some interesting points( princess Diana memorial, lido, Italian fountains).....but the best thing about this park was the lovely tame parakeets that you can feed out of your hands!:) ||February 26, 2019
Phloxylady2||50||Very busy on a sunny Sunday afternoon! The LIDO was packed with people so we could not find a place to sit...so we walked and walked...always fun!||February 26, 2019
Ealianora||40||Seemed like all of London was enjoying the sun in Hyde park. Still there was plenty of room and benches to sit on. The public restrooms were clean. Lots of people on the water in the bike boats. But also sitting on the grass, picknicking. The wonderful Diana memorial fountain was working, and there were even children and adults walking barefoot in the water. Lots of flowers were blooming. It all looked like a summers day. Only give away that it was not were the still leafless trees. What a wonderful place to spend the day.||February 25, 2019

726vickih||40||We had an hour to kill. The main gardens are fenced off for maintenance but we gave up trying to find a wheelchair accessible toilet that was accessible near the fountains. Very pretty a space to stop for a bit in an unusually warm February day. ||February 25, 2019
395ally||40||Such a good place to walk and relax even if it is cold. Plenty of others doing it as well so some diversions watching the other visitors! Plenty of ducks and geese to amuse small kids as well as places to have coffee. Speakers Corner (on Hyde Park corner) is something different and an example of the eccentricity of the English! Kensington Palace is worth the visit.||February 25, 2019
161Kaz63||50||My husband & 1 spent 2 hours wandering around. Lovely sunny Sunday, lots of different things to see, just a nice place to visit and stroll around at your leisure.||February 24, 2019

Ray M||40||you can from four different sidesqueensway, marble arch, hyde park corner, royal albert hall.go down by the lake and maybe take out a boat.only downside is drinks and snacks expensive in their cafe.||February 23, 2019
Paul G||30||We walked through here after a show at the Royal Albert Hall. Been to this park many times before. There’s a good selection of wildlife and cafes to sit and take it in. However the Princess Diana. Memorial which we went in to see was dry and not working, very disappointing. Some nice statues, a bronze Ibis and the Horses head (still water) were really good. As dusk approaches it gets really busy with cyclists and runners etc all going home, very surprising. Good to stretch your legs but overall nothing outstanding.||February 22, 2019

Juliana L||50||It was a perfect cold and sunny day when I went for a walk. It wasn't too full and I managed to enjoy the scenery really peacefully. I didn't have much time, there is so much to see there, many walks to do. I would have spent a whole day if I could.||February 19, 2019

S T||50||It's a pretty big park, there is a large pond, where ducks and other water birds will get really close to you, I guess expecting for food. There is a Carnival set up at one section. We were there in the afternoon, close to sun set, and it was beautiful. The lighting inside the park is also very pretty. Many pretty flower and trees, you can enjoy a really nice walk in this park, and afterwards, you can visit Victoria and Albert museum or Natural Museum around the corner, too.||February 18, 2019
ΔΕΣΠΟΙΝΑ Ζ||50||Its a wonderful place. Its so big that you cant see it all. There is lake, animals,birds. Also there are place to rest for a while....||February 17, 2019
marvellousmoment||50||Hyde Park is somewhere that you can spend you whole day! Especially if the weather is sunny and warm. There are many swans and ducks and you can feed them if you want to :) This place is beautiful if you are nature lover and want to have some walk, it will be good decision to spend day there :) ||February 17, 2019
U167TSrobertg||50||you can watch the horses going for their exercise and also watch the swans on the serpentine if you go at the the right you will see the swimmers||February 17, 2019
jerichov2018||50||Had a good afternoon walk last year before autumn-- its vast enough to go through for hours-- and its connected to the kensington gardens which is a bonus.We had a nice time walking around the lake (river? Stream?) not sure but i think it was a small lake. There is a small spot for people to take a swim--but perhaps id rather not.The park is clean, ideal for families and group activities and cycling.We wanted to cycle around the park but we couldnt find the cycle rental kiosk (spot)--- we hope to find one next time.During winter-- the hyde park is home to the Winter Wonderland theme park-- which surprisingly was fit for any age group-- did not expect it to have more than just food and rides--- trying to get into the park is a challenge due to influx of visitors--but its worth it.||February 17, 2019
ma6r||50||Get your bag and travel don’t ever think how will it goes, thank me then :) For pp that even cant just get little journey ||February 16, 2019
LightFighter||40||The park was originally used by Henry VIII as a hunting ground and today is full of couples and families looking for a quiet retreat for urban London. Beautiful walking paths criss-cross the park and we thoroughly enjoyed the long stroll through several of the royal parks from Kensington Palace to Buckingham Palace.||February 16, 2019
Abofahad1435||50||The place that you would like to walk every day during your stay at London and have your breakfast and coffee on lakeside ||February 16, 2019
hisbell0||50||Walking around Hide Park is something everybody who is visiting London should do. The Serpentine lake, feeding the swans, visiting Apsley Gate, Holocaust Memmorial Garden are places to be seen||February 16, 2019
LCPUSA||50||It is a great park to visit in London, with interesting areas like Kensington Gardens, the Italian gardens, etc. If you are into royalty, the Albert memorial and princess Diana's fountain are there. the best way way to visit is as passage from the Albert and Victoria museum to Oxford Street. Then, you will get out of the park through the Speaker's corner, where there is always somebody giving a discourse against something. Brexit is a preferred subject right now. There are beautiful street sculptures in that area.||February 15, 2019
Cheetah2712||50||Lots is always happening in there. If it's a concert or organised park run or roller skating. Always full of ideas, massive space for everyone to do something different. Has a lovely cafe by the pond, very well kept areas for picnic. Fantastic day for days out or event a date!||February 15, 2019
Krapivnitski G||50||I really enjoyed it, when I went there with my friend. It was nice and quiet, the weather was absolutely amazing. A great walk in the park.||February 14, 2019
LeeG905||40||Nice serene green area in London, great for a stroll. Clean and well kept. Nice amount of birds and unusually brave squirrels wondering around too, if you like swans you will love it here, they are everywhere. ||February 14, 2019
GoatasticUK||50||We went on the Wednesday in the daytime and it wasn't too crowded at all. Really friendly and we loved it. Roller coaster was scary!!!Would book some tickets ahead of time.||February 13, 2019
LeonieFischer||50||As one of eight Royal Parks in London, this playground of Henry the VIII which was a hunting ground for herd of deer, still attracts visitors from all the corners of the world. Londoners love to visit the park either for leisure or sporting events. So much to see in this beautiful area in London, you have so many options, from viewing the Rose Garden to visit Princess Diana's Memorial Fountain, it is an absolute must in London. We enjoyed walking through the gardens from our hotel to Kensigton.||February 13, 2019
intlkitty||50||I've spent many afternoons with friends in Hyde Park. It's a huge park and you can enter from different sides. Enter across from the Royal Albert Hall and see the Albert memorial. Enter near Kensington High St and walk to Kensington Gardens and Palace. You can roller blades in the park, walk, jog, and have picnics. Enter by Lancaster gate or Queensway and walk in toward the Italian Gardens. These are very pretty and you can buy an ice cream near here in summer. Public bathrooms are located closer to Lancaster gate. There is a lovely lido in the park where you can swim in the summer. It's a bit murky, lots of algae and I probably wouldn't swim there again but it was a hot day! Bring a blanket, book and relax here on a Sunday when the weather is nice. It's a huge park so make sure you arrange a meeting point!||February 13, 2019
Fluffybunny1973||50||This park is gorgeous getaway in the centre of a busy city. The scenery is absolutely beautiful and it offers an opportunity to escape from the buzz of city life. There are stall where you can grab a hot chocolate while you explore. A particular highlight of mine was the boats you can rent on the lake. They cost €10 per person for 30 minutes. You can choose a peddle or a row boat and you’re guaranteed good fun and exercise!||February 13, 2019
rodrigoeugeniog||50||Hyde Park is a must-go park in London, although you would need a few couple of hours to really enjoy it. The sunset from this park was awesome. Oh, it also has the Winter Wonderland in Winter, and many concerts throughout the year.||February 13, 2019
HCT1962||40||We were in London arriving at Paddington and heading for Kensington area so to include a walk through Hyde Park even on a winters day makes for a reasonable plan as if time permits we always do our best in London to walk away from the main streets whilst also avoiding using the tube.We didn’t know the direction for sure to take and pretty much stumbled across the Italian Water Gardens area which we’d not seen before.From there skirting around the Serpentine we headed past the Peter Pan bronze statue and came across an area where people were feeding the ring-necked parakeets with nuts etc.There were plenty of them and they were landing on people’s outstretched arms and shoulders in their clamour to be fed, so even though we see these regularly at a distance nearer our home in Berkshire it was quite a sight.This is just a snippet of things you can see in the park even on a grey overcast winters day so just get out there and see what you can see for yourself.||February 13, 2019
trapioan||30||Indeed it is a big oasis of green + lake + animals in the heart of London....when you say Hyde Park ...sounds like UAU...but in the end it is a very big park with a big lake and nice wildlife animals for children especially...prepare to walk miles if you want to go across...it is quite silent, clean, well maintained but nothing spectacular they way it is designed.||February 13, 2019
WHISPAS||50||All can say is wow. What a parade.. Every one who was on the parade deserves a big pat on the back. Well done everyone.. ||February 12, 2019
Kaz D||50||Ideal for anyone. Lots of wildlife roaming around the park, the squirrels will come up to you for food. Wide paths, although watch out for the cyclists.||February 12, 2019
Francoise-S-11b||50||London is a city with many large parks, and hundreds of small parks in community squares. This park, with its lakes, swans and many greens where one can lounge, is a beloved destination in the summer for Londoners wishing to picnic out of doors. One of its corners "Hide Park Corner" is a well known place for people to address the crowds.||February 12, 2019
dianabV4585NC||50||Love this place. It is awesome. Google it. Whether you are a family with young or older children, a couple, a group of friends, or goung solo, there is a place for everyone! Lots of tea houses/cafes, Diana Walk/memorial gardens, fabulous playground for the young family, the serpentine, the lido, gallery to mention a few... Great location too - close to the Royal Albert Hall, Science museum, Natural History museum, Victoria and Albert museum. And is you like shopping, you have Knightsbridge, Marble Arch/ Oxford Street, High Street Kensington near by (short bus journeys or between 15 - 30 min walk depending where in the park you are). And of course a few lovely pubs dotted around the circumference.||February 12, 2019
rdavies15||50||A huge open space in the middle London and full of History. Speakers corner,the statues and of course Serpentine. Fond memories for me, boating and swimming surrounded by the Horse guards and their horses and great Hotels etc. All on top of Knightsbridge and it’s shops. WONDERFUL.||February 12, 2019
LOOKUPBettabusDotCom||50||If you want to experience the weird and whacky side of people, turn up at Speakers Corner on a Sunday morning. Not to be confused with Hyde Park corner which is at the other end of the park. Speakers Corner next to Marble Arch is an area protected by English Law where anyone may get up and speak about almost anything. You'll find people wanting to make a point about any of the various things that bothers or impresses them.Politics always plays a part in some speeches while the environment will be the content of others. If you have message to deliver and want to air out your lungs, bring long a little wooden box to stand on and start shouting. You might even attract a crowd if you are good! Enjoy it!||February 12, 2019
russelgillian335||50||Walked the park on multiple days saw something new every time. Fed the parrots which are very friendly.||February 12, 2019
danielfN4142ES||50||Lots to do all year round. Wildlife to watch, squirrels and birds mostly, beautiful trees, manicured garden areas and well maintained walking trails. Felt safe walking through the park at all hours.||February 12, 2019
davidgD5846IV||50||Because it is just such a nice place to be. Leave Oxford Street at Marble Arch, walk across the junction, into the park, and take a right and walk along the northern edge, all the way to the beautiful Italian Gardens. If you stand in the right place, and like symmetry in your photos, you'll get a great photo. There are also public toilets near here as well.From the Italian gardens, you can go south towards the Serpentine Lake, or continue west to the Diana Memorial playground, the Orangery and Kensington Palace.The Orangery is a lovely place to have a little wander. Nearby is the Round Pond, which is full of swans and ducks, and sometimes people playing with remote control boats. Again, another great photo opportunityGo to the southwest corner, and then walk through the flower walk. It's really pretty, and has a different vibe to the rest of the park. You'll emerge right by the Albert memorial, close to the Albert Hall, and 10 minutes away from the science and natural history museumsLittle tip. From the Albert Memorial, go north past the Serpentine Gallery, heading back to the bridge that crosses the Serpentine, but don't cross it. Go left of it and walk away from it back towards the Italian Gardens. About 50 metres before you get to the Peter Pan statue, you will probably see a group of people under the trees. You'll see they are feeding parakeets by hand, as well as pigeons. I'll let you check out the urban legend of how the parakeets came to be in London!Go back to the bridge, underneath it and you'll walk past the Princess Diana memorial Fountain. It's worth a little wander around here. Keep going east with the lake to your left, and just take in the views. It's a nice place and will help you relax. Keep walking and let the lake fade away to your left and continue east, through the Rose Garden, past the Huntress Fountain, and towards Green Park and Buckingham PalaceYou'll do this walk, and hear Ferrari's on the nearby roads. Wander past horses at play. See swans, and if you have an apple or a little birdseed, provide for a parakeet. London life is different here. Definitely take some time in London to spend some time here||February 12, 2019
Quantumlondon1||50||If you want some relief from the noise and pollution of central London, this is a perfect place for a long walk around the Serpentine lake or to the memorial pool for Princess Diana. There are a few places for a coffee, light lunch and a post-work drink (ideal in the summer when the days are longer). Or just bring a picnic and find a quiet spot. ||February 12, 2019
Kay P||50||Hyde Park is one of my favourite parks in the world! I’m a Londoner and I’ve travelled the world, but Hyde Park is still my favourite park! You can go on row boats in the Serpentine, or take a quick bite in the café, or simply walk around the park. It is almost always busy, but still remains peaceful. The location is great too : a stone’s throw away from the world-famous Harrods and Harvey Nichols on one side, the Royal Albert Hall and wonderful Museums on the other. You have to visit Hyde Park when in London!||February 12, 2019
martin b||50||Londons premier park, Hyde Park is best in the winter during Winter Wonderland, Europes largest Winter event. Many great things to do, great food to eat and of course the MegaDome which house Cirque Berserk, Britains best loved "made for theatres" thrill circus.||February 12, 2019
Lillie M||50||I love going to Hyde Park on a nice day. Great place to go for a walk, and when it is warm it is fun to rent a peddle boat to go around the pond. The birds are kind of all over near the Serpentine, so if you dislike birds, I'd recommend not going near the pond.||February 12, 2019
bnghanem||30||The biggest park in london Maybe there is bigger but I didn't see Nice but do not suits for this time Freezing and rain ||February 11, 2019
mijagr||50||It is the biggest park in London. There is really nice. I really recomend visit at summer and winter. ||February 11, 2019
Jdread2000ad||40||Its a place where we used to go for a relaxing walk when we used to live in London. And during the recent trip, a stroll in the park still have that calming and relaxing effect on us. Although in winter it is cold, but that doesn't bother us. Appreciate that the park is being kept clean by the relevant parties. ||February 10, 2019
EODUK||50||Hyde Park is a lovely open space to take a stroll around, plenty of things to look at and many different routes, popular with tourists and locals a like and great to visit at anytime of the year.||February 10, 2019
terryannep||50||I can spend hours walking around Hyde Park and not get tired. The footpaths are wonderful photography trails. Sometimes just sitting and reading a good book for a couple of hours on a bench and watching the world go by is the best therapy!||February 10, 2019
Sofie A||50||It s big and pleasant to visit. Its in the heart of the city,many joggers around. It has his own charakter.||February 10, 2019
Judith E||50||We walked through Kensington Gardens to Hyde Park. It was so cold the Serpentine was frozen in the middle.The fountain was beautiful and well worth a visit||February 9, 2019

AdamBurt||40||The Park remind me of my hometown, Leeds' park Roundhay Park. It a nice place to hang out and walk about. Also Speakers' corner sadly no one about and speaking want to know what going on but seem not that time. Also Park big you can fit festvial and fun fair.||February 9, 2019
Scott G||50||This park is right next to Kensington Palace and has a memorial to Princess Diana and Queen Victoria's husband, Albert. There is also a statues of Queen Victoria right outside of Kensington Palace. We walked from Kensington Palace through the park to catch a bus. It's a great park with lots of walking paths. ||February 8, 2019
camin-travel||40||I went on a typical winter London's day, cloudy and bit rainy, but the path for walking and the different type of birds to see as well trees and roses is something beautiful.||February 7, 2019
Marie B||40||So pleasant, quiet, a far cry from the hectic centre of the city. Even in early February there are primulas and some other early flowers and flowering shrubs, and the fountains in the Serpentine are on (unlike in other big cities).||February 7, 2019
Rayling C||50||This is another park I have walked through during my stay at London, and I loved it. I have been there during winter and summer and it was both a nice walk and had a good sightseeing inside the park, even though it was less greener during winter but it was still worth visiting it. ||February 7, 2019
dmatesic||50||If you like for a walk around here you can see a lot of small animals, especially squirrels. Pretty nice!||February 7, 2019

johnsM1642BJ||50||Ran a lap in the park in the evening, I did not get raped nor mugged which was really good. Some rats running around though! I would recommend it to a friend.. :)||February 6, 2019
BridgetJ712||50||You can get away from the hustle and bustle of London traffic and escape to the lake in Hyde park, pretty much any time. But on a warm spring/sunny or indeed autumn day it is extra special. Sitting on a grass and reading is very relaxing. I mentioned grass, because sun loungers come at a cost - sadly....||February 6, 2019

PotomacJim||50||Hyde park is one of the largest parks in central London and leads to Kensington Palace at one end. It’s a great place to run a few miles and avoid the London traffic. But it’s also a wonderful walk to chill for a while as well as the preferred path to Kensington Palace. If spent hours here and it’s easy to forget you are in a city when you are deep in Hyde Park. There are Tube stations all along the periphery, so it’s easy to pop up and plunge yourself into the greenery ||February 3, 2019
MikeAins||50||Weve not had the pleasure of visiting Hyde Park before.It's simply a lovely place to wander through, and a nice distraction from the hustle & bustle of London ||February 3, 2019
oebep||40||A great place to kill time especially in summer, plenty of people jogging or simply walking and if it's warm sit by the serpentine and read your paper while watching the ducks and swans being fed.||February 3, 2019

danandbeckyfowler||50||What a lovely park in the middle of a capital city - the parks are what make London stand out from other cities.Im a country girl so love greenery because it makes me feel at home||January 31, 2019
leonard696||50||I spent at least one day a week lying around in Hyde Park with my girlfriend, just talking and watching the day go by. I have never had such a good time in my life. You might assume that it is just a big park and that there is not much to do. However this is so wrong: There is so much to do. We walked around the park for hours, and it was just nice to be somewhere where people will give you your own space and you can just be with someone you love. I know that sounds really cheesy but it is true. I recommend it for young couples who just want to be together but don't necessarily have that much money. It is also a change to the other carp that you have to do over and over again, for example the cinema.||January 30, 2019
lisa w||50||Great walk around this park however was very cold on the day we visited. Lots to look at and very family friendly.||January 29, 2019
sarawaldner||50||If you enjoy an afternoon walk, this is a place I would highly recommend for you. The Serpentine Pond provides a variety of wildlife to take in as you enjoy conversation with a friend and a peaceful stroll. With the big city so near, you still feel a part of London while also feeling very far from the city. Kensington Palace/Kensington Gardens is also near to the area, so you can enjoy the views of the royal castle or pay a small fee to enter. This adds to the culture of London by showing just how much the citizens like to enjoy a quick getaway from the city. So many people come here on their breaks at work to enjoy the nature and feel a sense of peace. I very much enjoyed the ability to getaway while still being in the city. Would HIGHLY recommend a day time visit because it is not very well-lit at night.||January 29, 2019
Carter W||50||Dogs are kept on leads and the whole atmosphere is relaxing just perfect for the whole family when you need exercise and want to clear your head from the busy city. Fantastic place to visit!||January 29, 2019
linhcheskyn||50||In contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city, Hyde Park is where you can find your inner peace. It is such a great place to wind down after a hectic day in the office or simply burn off all the calories with a stroll in the park||January 29, 2019
McAnnie1||40||What an amazing Christmas wonderland takes place in December. Loads of fair activities & lots of eating & drinking venues. It's packed out late afternoon & at night time. Best to visit late morning if taking young children.||January 28, 2019
Ann Marie E||50||If you're in Hyde Park in late November up to Christmas, don't miss the Christmas Fair in the park. It's like no other: huge, colorful, fun and free. ||January 28, 2019

Suff0102||50||I spent a good couple of hours aimlessly walking through and exploring the park (and adjacent Kensington Gardens) looking for subjects for a photo assignment. Lovely open spaces, places to sit and reflect or watch the bird life. Could easily take a picnic and spend a day here.||January 24, 2019
1039||30||Massive area and a bit hard to navigate. Wish we had more time to scope it out and rent bikes, etc. Unfortunately, we were there during last summer's heat wave, so a lot of walking was not in the cards. ||January 24, 2019
rabby_Sh00||50||Nice for a good stroll around, get away from a day's hectic sight seeing, really tranquil late in the evening for resting in.||January 24, 2019
mateo130||50||We stayed near the park and it was great to start the day with a walk in there. It is amazing how the British kept these huge green areas within a city like London. Great to go there and see ho people use this in their daily routine.||January 23, 2019
AdelaideTraveller888||50||A huge park that sits nicely near Buckingham and Kensington Palaces, offering relaxing and peaceful spots to play with the kids or to have a picnic. The water was teeming with birdlife, such as white swans and peach-coloured pelicans; the trees and lawns with birds and squirrels. Fantastic place for leisurely walks. During December when we visited, Winter Wonderland was in place with all its Christmas wondrousness. Loved it.||January 23, 2019
JJBlondie||50||As we were staying in West London near Kensington palace we often wandered through Hyde Park to get to various locations.It is a very large and beautiful park with lots to see and little cafes sprinkled throughout in case you need a coffee or a water during your travels.There are lots of little ponds, statues, and memorials located within the park.There are also lots of locals out walking their dogs and/or feeding the birds.||January 23, 2019
Adroso360||50||Hyde Park is huge and a great place to walk around, Even in Winter. Its full of things to see, random animals and a good place to exercise. I would recommend splitting your visit over a couple of days. On one day visit Kensington palace and the surrounding area of the park, and on another visit the other side of the park. During winter visit Hyde Park Winter Wonderland.||January 23, 2019
mdsmith0911||40||Stunning and beautiful park, close to all the sights and sounds that London can offer. Always enjoy and visit here when in London. It has some beautiful gardens to explore. Lovely park to relax in. ||January 22, 2019
D4717KAmarkm||50||Hyde park was a lovely place to take a morning or evening stroll. It is well laid out and is a little piece of heaven when tryint to clear that oh so sore head from the night before. ||January 21, 2019
MartynHC||50||well, what can you say about a park?! It's a wonderful green space in central London and I never tyre of walking round/ through it. The Diana Memorial Fountain is a bit naff but hey, it doesn't matter.||January 21, 2019
jackinbox99||50||I have been to London litterally thousands of times, but never ventured through Hyde Park before. I had some spare time, so I did on my last trip. What an amazinig place. Its massive. You can wander about, trees, grass, lakes, squirrels and loads to see. You can cut through it and get to the Albert Statue & then onto the museums. Great place to take time out from all the hussle & bussle of daily London life. It was like being in another county.||January 21, 2019
lyndona65||50||The park has a lake and loads of wildlife... Good to sunbathe in the summer, one of the best parks in London||January 20, 2019
Ninu N||50||Must visit place in London. Its huge and has something for every age. My personal favourite is Diana memorial. Kids would definitely love it.And if you are around here during Christmas, visit the Winter Wonderland too||January 20, 2019
rmh222||50||We went to the Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park, which was festive and fun. We were so pleasantly surprised on our walk down to the park the next morning to find a beautiful, huge park to wander around. The memorials are all so interesting, and there's something to look at around every corner or across every green space. We wish we had more time to explore, linger, and take it all in!Would recommend 1-2 hours at Winter Wonderland (without rides or ticketed activities), and 1-3 hours just in the park itself, depending on how much you like to walk, the season and weather, and whether or not you're planning a picnic!||January 20, 2019
tracymQ1765RZ||50||Such a lovely park for walking my little dog. Loves a cheeky ride on the seasonal carousel on Kensington side. Princess Diana water feature is so peaceful even when busy if that makes sense. Love a deckchair with an ice cream after a pedal boat. Treasured memories. ||January 20, 2019

thr2506||50||Super lucky to have Greenland so big in the middle of London. After walking 5 minutes into it, you don’t feel like you’re in London anymore. Great for a walk to get some fresh air or to run round. Winter wonderland is also worth a visit at Christmas. ||January 17, 2019
Irenaeus d||50||Have been in Hyde Park many times in my life, A good place to go to "Switch off".The sound is swithed off from the hussle and bussle of the city and you may as well be on the farm and its tranquility. thhe ||January 17, 2019

jennifervancliff||40||So many entrances into the park .Go as early as you can ,and enjoy watching the early morning swimmers both human and the swans/and ducks .The memorial to Diana is ok but the walk all around the lake is fabulous . There is a great cafe at the Hyde park end .||January 15, 2019
allisonharmon||50||When visiting London with friends in August the weather was so good we decided to take a walk through Hyde Park. It was just glorious. We even ventured onto the Serpentine in a paddle boat! After that we sat in deck chairs under the shade of the trees. Really is a wonderful amenity. Worth a stroll. Don’t hurry through it. ||January 15, 2019

Charles M||30||If like me, you are not a London resident and is on a visit to this wonderful city, Hyde Park is a must. TYhe lake is full of swans and the park is mostly full of trees with squirrels coming out to eat from your hands. ||January 15, 2019
MCourtemanche||50||Side by side with Kensington Garden and linked to the green park you can do great run days and nights!Each time I am in London for business in paddington area where my company has an office.I am always looking forward to free time for a run either morning or evening. It close and easy to reach. Once there you can do a long run 10 to 12 Kms without passing by the same place Finally yo will see Buckingham palace in unique as running around I love doing that each and every time!||January 15, 2019

soumitnaik||50||Excellent for morning stroll/run specially in summer. Takes about 20-25 minutes to complete the entire walk at a leisurely pace in the company of nature, a small lake and beautiful birds away from the hustle and bustle of the fast city life outside. Don’t miss! ||January 15, 2019
ianandclairewallis||50||Walking in this vast park is lovely. Our dog Bella really enjoyed the park too. Walk from edge to edge north to South East to west and see it all.Only off putting bit is speakers corner. Stay away from that as its very intimidating. ||January 14, 2019
lindamJ667NL||50||I always loved this park and it is very walkable. I really had a great time on my recent trip and really think the bird watching there is worthwhile. Its a treasure in the middle of the big city.||January 14, 2019

RuralHeels||50||Hyde Park is beautiful and well worth a visit, even if its just to see the bright green Parakeets flying around freely. No I'm not going mad - visit and see....||January 10, 2019
KseniaLoveUBritain||50||Hyde Park is one of the largest parks in central London , England and one of the Royal Parks of London, famous for its Speakers' Corner where anyone can have a chance to express oneself openly. Good in all times and seasons!||January 10, 2019
em17_07||50||We spent an hour walking through Hyde Park. We passed the Diana memorial fountain (I wasn't too impressed with it). Along the river plenty of birds, ducks, swans, herons. It was such an enjoyable walk! There is also a little cafè with tables and chairs and clean toilets. ||January 9, 2019
manxmanpaul||40||We were staying near the Earl's Court tube station, about 15-20 minutes walk away from the park. It was a lovely spot to wander in, nice & clean, with lots of quite tame grey squirrels & the now resident parakeets flying overhead. We saw the very impressive Albert Memorial & the not so impressive Diana Memorial Fountain||January 9, 2019
lifestyle43||50||The weather started off good but as the day went on the weather changed and it started to rain which was not looking good for the planed event in the park. The Proms was a good day out the park was packed full of people. I had the best view of the stage and saw my favourite singer classic boy band now working as a solo artist Mr G your simply the best singer, I am sure I lost me voice that day with all the cheering. ||January 9, 2019
Fred R||50||My wife and an adult daughter walked through the park several times during our 8-day visit during the 2018 holiday season. The park seems to always be between our flat in Earls Court and where we wanted to go. One day we toured Kensington Palace shortly after it opened. The line was very short.||January 9, 2019
vijay r||40||With the ongoing winter wonderland it was like a giant fair with rides and food and drink. Loads of stalls selling their offerings, it was melee. Loved the festive mood.||January 8, 2019
mallorcasara||50||We arrived at the park at 4pm it was still light. We got to see plenty of wild life, Swans, birds, ducks! As we carried on walking night set in and by the time we reached the winter wonderland it was dark! All the rides were lit up with beautiful colours. There was so much to see and do! Great for family's and romantic strolls too!||January 8, 2019
ScottCong||50||Hyde park is simply the best place to chill and relax in London. It is so big and so many things can be done there but mostly in summer: festivals, concerts, play sports, picnic, cycling, running etc. This is the perfect peaceful & quiet place away from the busy London street that is in central London. Highly recommended for a visit in the summer, however not much going on in Winter. In a sunny warm summer day/evening, you will see a lot of happy people chilling out in the park. ||January 8, 2019

blairkk25||50||I walked in Hyde Park in November 2018. It brought back many memories as I walked in Hyde Park many times in the past during other trips to London. I passed by the Albert Memorial, Princess Diana Fountain, Serpentine and Speakers Corner. There seemed to be a new section with a Ferris Wheel and rides under construction. I started my walk at the Victoria & Albert Museum and walked all the way to Oxford Street via the park. It is definitely one of my favorite places to walk in London even during cold weather.||January 4, 2019
Shaheen_17||50||I specifically went for the Winter Wonderland. It's sort of like a fair with rides, games and food stalls. Quite nice, especially if you go as a couple or with friends. The lights are magnificent, but make sure to wrap yourself up because it's freezing this time of the year.||January 4, 2019

Kids and adult rides Christmas markets. Well worth going felt very safe there. Great experience for all book early to avoid disappointment.||January 3, 2019
Mackenzie L||40||We tried to go to Winter Wonderland while we were visiting over the holidays and everyone told us we HAD to go but the crowds were so crazy we decided not to. Maybe another year when we plan ahead more and not try to go the Saturday before Christmas we would have better luck.||January 3, 2019

cbwood2016||50||This park is HUGE! Nice to walk around in for awhile, and in the winter they have a carnival called Winter Wonderland that is nice for kids, although didn't really interest my family. Surrounding the two lakes there are birds everywhere, and I mean EVERYWHERE. You would think you were at a zoo. They are quite beautiful too, it's a really nice place to walk around for a bit. They also have bikes you can rent to ride around select pathways as well. It's definitely a nice outing for the family!||January 1, 2019
607pauliusj||50||Not much to see in winter. But I can imagine how beautiful the park will during summer. Will be back someday on summer time. Quiet disappointed with Ladi Di memorial park, nothing to see except grasses. ||January 1, 2019

Michaelhouse69||40||Everyone goes to Hyde Park and on to the Serpentine. Tube Green Park or walk down Oxford Street or Piccadilly. Speakers Corner, Serpentine, Diana’s memorial or just to enjoy the trees and have coffee. Using a map walk right through to Albert Memorial and Albert Hall. Then you are near the museums. Bus or Tube will bring you back to Central London. Quite safe. Easy walking. Paths good fir prams and wheelchairs. Children can run and run! One of London’s many free gifts to its visitors. Enjoy!||December 25, 2018
ojolley92||40||Our first day in London was spent solely marching around Hyde Park. The park is huge and beautiful. We arrived in London very early on a Sunday, which meant that many things were closed. The park was open, so we did a lot of walking and exploring. We also lucked up and found the winter wonderland carnival! ||December 25, 2018
khool2017||50||Not to be missed if you are visiting London near Christmas time. Free admission. Full of festive spirit and something to do for all ages. You can find the best Bavarian sausages and beer ! There are other attractions ( with paid admissions ) such as the Magic Ice Kingdom that will add to our experience. Wrap up and be prepared for hours of fun ! ||December 25, 2018
DimGkl||50||A wonderful park inside the London’s heart. Huge, green, many squirrels ducks a lot of different birds swans. I love to walk around the park and in the sunshine days I like to sit on green and feel the natural beauty!!!!||December 25, 2018
kgv2828||50||There are many nice parks in London but my favorite is Hyde Park. It is quite large and allows an opportunity to find a quiet spot for a rest or nap even in the busiest of times. I am lucky in that we stayed in the South Kensington or Knightsbridge and Hyde Park is a short walk.There are several lakes and different sights but I just like to find a green area that is quiet and put a blanket down and people watch or take a nice nap. Then when you are done, walk towards Knightsbridge and check out the stores like Harrods and others.||December 25, 2018
lormesher||30||If you love rides and side show alley games and Christmas markets and entertainment, then this is for you. The huge crowds made queuing for everything long, except for activities you could book in advance, I recommend doing this. Very wet and muddy underfoot so care needed dodging people as you made your way through the wonderland. More seating required. You can't take any drinks through the gate, but the bars will fill your water bottles for free.||December 25, 2018
AnthonySoigau||50||The fauna and the flora of this famous are really great. Attractions like serpentine lake and Speaker's Corner are also worth traveling.||December 25, 2018
Preeta A||50||Great visit to the Winter Wonderland. I loved the Carousel bar and the Dr Archibald VR Ride. Both were something unique. Excellent fair food choices. We had the Haloumi fries with a choice of sauce. A must visit attraction in winter. Go even if it is drizzling, most areas are covered.||December 24, 2018

datovijey||40||How to miss such an interesting Freedom of Speech corner. I first visited when l was a student. Next I visited 10yrs later. All U need to do is go corner to corner and listen to their speeches. What a Amazing thing! U can learn new things or just wasted your time. Choice is yours! My conclusion is it's an interesting place not to miss if U are visiting London. I wish anyone to go there without a 2nd thought. Meanwhile l wish every one a Very Happy Merry Christmas and welcome the New Year 2019 with a smile. All the best. My contact datovijey at gmail dot com||December 24, 2018
Giov_Ch||50||I spend my break time here. Most of my 10k step a day happens here. There are a lot of people jogging and other various activities to keep fit. It does not feel like you are in the middle of one of the busiest city's in the world. When not in the mood to walk, sitting on one of the benches by the Sepertine and watch the birds makes stress go away.At the moment the tranquility is ruined by the Winter Wonderland.||December 22, 2018

ddx99||50||Beautiful Autumn Sun, so many activities, so many routes, and so much to see. It felt like seeing London for a bit in slow motion with every walk of life (humans and animals) just going on for their stroll. sigh*=)||December 20, 2018
maudie186565||50||absolutely fabulous especially the Bavarian Market, Very authentic I would have liked to have gone back in the evening and sat at one of the long tables for food and drink||December 20, 2018
Maria H||50||It's always been a good place to stretch one's legs..when the famously poor British weather will allow. We fed the ducks, well we tried to but the swans came and bullied the poor darlings out of the water.||December 20, 2018
yorkshirelasses2018||50||Had a great time, all needs catered for, good variety of food and drink places, and plenty of clean toilets||December 19, 2018
dldcw2||40||We spent an afternoon and evening at Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. We had expected that it would be mainly Christmas Markets and Christmas lights. It turned out to be primarily a huge amusement park with thrill rides, carnival games, etc. We weren't interested in the rides, but we found the Christmas market section of Winter Wonderland to be by far the biggest and best in London. The lights were primarily the amusement park lights rather than Christmas lights. There were several modestly priced entertainment venues, like Zippos Christmas Circus and Cirque Berserk which were quite good, but there were no proper restaurants on the grounds. The afternoon was easy and pleasant to get around in, but the evening was more of an attraction to young people, and there were many.||December 19, 2018
deek470||50||Hyde Park is an extension of Kensington Gardens or visa versa!They re beautiful with a huge lake in the middle.There are plenty of cafes, play areas for childrenIf you go off the beaten track a little you can find really interesting aspects of the park with historical plaques, the old Police Station, statures and lovely ornate Gardens, It is big enough to get some real exercise and connecting with the other Royal Parks, you could get a good 8 mile walk in! ||December 19, 2018
joanat480||40||It has a beautiful landscape and there are a lot of people doing exercise here (even with rain). This garden is very nice since it is in the middle of the city where we can "scape" a lit bit from the city's noise and relax.You can also take a look at the Kensington palace that is a very nice building.||December 19, 2018
BasketElias||50||Best place to visit for walk and relax or for running in the forest, just in the middle of London! Strongly recommended!||December 18, 2018
Dan I||50||Relax and enjoy the beautiful landscape.Do not rush in/out, just take a day or two, three half days to enjoy this magnificent park.Sit and observe the natural life around you.||December 18, 2018
Escape256540||40||I thoroughly enjoyed strolling through Hyde Park (we spent hours there as the scenery was beautiful). Winter Wonderland was also very nice. We didn't go on any rides because the prices were very expensive, around 9 pounds per ride, but we had a very enjoyable time there.||December 18, 2018
robino1989||50||Really amazing at Winter Wonderland! So much beautiful things and all kind of food u can imagine! :D really crazy Christmasy everywhere and the area is so LARGE! load of Attractions and places to have a beer or mulled wine!!Large Christmas market and so much more! A must visit if you are there in December!||December 18, 2018
JuliaLansley||40||This is a great place to visit as there are many things to do in and around the park. I'd recommend hiring a Santander Bike so that you can travel around the park faster. ||December 18, 2018
RoodZwammetje||40||Winter Wonderland is amazing to see, especially at night with all the lights on. The park itself is big and clean, but not really special. It's a very basic park, not that pretty in winter at least. It's mostly just grass, Maybe there are flowers in summer, I might take a look there then.||December 18, 2018
MiloMagic2||50||All the reviews were correct - this is an amazing park and we wander for hours just getting lost on a beautiful day. The swans were also lovely to watch but can get a little aggressive so we kept our distance.||December 17, 2018
Dina J||50||What a beautiful park to go for a stroll in or go for a jog. Wonderful photos can be taken. In the winter they have a free winter wonderland park. ||December 17, 2018
959clairs||50||Hyde park is one of the nicest park I've been to , nice to see the wildlife (squirrel's running round etc ) love visiting for winter wonderland can hold so much more (bit expensive so save before u go to winter wonderland) ||December 17, 2018
Andy F||40||Trip was aimed mainly at the wonderland experience.Weather spoilt it has it lashed down with rain and was freezing. But despite the weather we made of it what we could. Plenty to do and loads of food and drink stalls. We did the Peter Pan on ice show and it was brilliant......well worth the visit.||December 17, 2018
Superduper1232328070||50||London is know for it’s beautiful parks. The Hyde park would rank the topmost as per my list. You can take a leisurely walk,jog,cycle or walk your dog,You can spend the whole day walking in and around Hyde park The Serpentine lake is within the park area and so is the Lady Diane memorial. If you keep on walking to the west side of Hyde park you will come Kensington gardens, and if are more adventurous keep on walking till to come to Kensington palace. Trust me it’s a walk that you will not regret!||December 17, 2018
Philip L||50||Lots of hidden gems to find as you explore Hyde Park, can be busy, but something to do for everyone.||December 16, 2018
TilakSen2014||50||Wonderful expanse with relatively few structures that keep it natural. Great for walking the length and breadth without too many people to rob one of a sense of privacy and measure of solitude. There are prettier parks in London like Regents and St. James and they’re are very alluring when the flowers are in bloom but Hyde park remains majestic and her majesty is nearby too!!||December 16, 2018
Sibel D||50||Every time we visit London, we stay very close to Hyde Park. So we have the chance to start our day at Hyde Park. It is huge and lovely, you can see a lot of swans on the lake, have something to eat on the green, walk around.||December 15, 2018
mr_foreland||50||We visit once a year in London and yes, i pop the question in Hyde Park! This is a perfect place for a picnic and feed some squirrels.||December 15, 2018

Mohammad A||50||The best experience is with the swans, never seen swans that chase people to eat, you go feed the ducks swans pull your jacket hahahah, squrils are around the trees they come to so you feed them, nice cafe by the lake.||December 14, 2018
Jackdaniels26||50||I took a walk through Hyde Park in the early morning, there was a hoar frost and it was an exhilarating experience. If you love people watching, this is the place to go. ||December 14, 2018
Barbara E||50||This park is huge, great for family picnic in summer or just for nice walk. Lovely lakes with swans, beautiful nature||December 13, 2018
SisterinParis||40||We visited the Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. Go when it gets dark so you can see all the lights. Bring your appetite because there are lots of places to eat there. While entrance to the main areas is free, you'll have to pay for special activities within the park. Recommend going to see it though. ||December 13, 2018
DanP3366||50||It is a great escape in London and perfect all year round, really makes me feel happy and you can easily spend a whole day there, there are also shops, bars, cafe's and restaurants to refresh.||December 13, 2018
23tejap||50||We visited Winter Wonderland. It is beautiful but very crowdy. You need to take lot of time (few days!) if you want to visit all the attractions cause you wait in line for quite a while.||December 13, 2018
hearty_dolphin||40||We were there in the evening. As it was raining and was dark, so we didn't manage to spend a good time there. Such a pity. Was rather a wet season when we were there. ||December 12, 2018
ts1052||50||Hyde Park becomes Winter Wonderland at Christmas and it is spectacular. It is a giant carnival/beer garden/Christmas market with food, lights and fun galore. It has to be pure magic for a child as it is so wonderful for an adult. Talk about the perfect evening--and what a way to get all the Christmas spirit you need.||December 12, 2018
Debcati||50||A lovely green space and so easy to pass through. Worth a little detour if you're there. There's always something going on, and peace to find if you need it.||December 12, 2018

bmulvan||50||We decided to walk through Hyde Park on our way to Victoria Station and one word sums it up - awesome. Actually...another too - romantic.||December 11, 2018
Kermit1frog||40||Beautiful wide open park, with boating lake ( charges apply for rental of equipment ) and cafes. Walk around and enjoy nature, relax and maybe sit on a bench amongst green leafy trees. Then grab an ice cream or visit the cafe/ eateries for some nice food. Regular patrols by police and park keepers.||December 11, 2018
janeasherswims||50||Even on a horrible rainy day this is a wonderful park. thousands of people can gather and it is still spacious and graceful.||December 11, 2018
CLDLSLCL||40||We thoroughly enjoyed exploring this park. It has a number of statues, like the Peter Pan statue, and other memorials including the one for Diana, Princess of Wales. The fountain was closed for maintenance, but you could tell it would be lovely at night when lit up. There is also a Holocaust memorial in the park. ||December 11, 2018
msmary2016||40||In the heart of the busy and crowded London center, you can stop for a walk through the serpentine and admire the charming swans and ducks... Lots of bucolic spots to don't miss out!!||December 11, 2018
634giuseppe||50||We had a nice walk, nice coffee shop, plenty of street parking. There is much more to do in the summer with the lake being an attraction but not at this time of year||December 11, 2018
Explorior||50||An absolute must visit for nature lovers. Lose yourself in endless walks, runs or bike rides all over this massive and extremely well maintained park. You will feel refreshed and one with nature from the moment you set foot in the park to hours after you leave it.||December 11, 2018
a_oseifrimpong||50||Hyde Park is and has always been historic for events worth memory lane. Every Christmas we make it a priority to visit winter wonderland at Hyde Park.||December 11, 2018
Eric F||30||Christmas Market is good, but focused on rides. Good choice on food. Poor choice of crafts. Interesting layout and very family friendly.||December 11, 2018
SergioPraha||40||I was in Hyde Park multiple times and always finding new interesting hidden corners :)And it is virtually in the center of the London.||December 11, 2018
Jake_51423||40||I went to Winter Wonderland this December in Hyde Park. It was generally a good day out and the atmosphere was good. The rides were expensive however so keep that in mind when going. Otherwise Hyde Park is a great place to visit and you can easily get there by bus or tube.||December 11, 2018
Tiberiu V||50||Very nice park with plenty of wildlife,swans, ducks, goose,pigeons, squirrels.. Bring some nuts with you and you will be the squirrels best friend.. They will eat them from the palm of your hand..As far as i know, there is 1 cafe, with sandwiches, snacks, hot tea and coffee, ice-cream.. A bit pricey, but not a rip off..||December 11, 2018
jennyaswede||30||We were there during their "Winter wonderland" it was A LOT of people, a lot of noises... if your after rollercoasters it is really good activity, but if you are looking after christmas shopping with handmade things it is a really bad choice.||December 11, 2018

kcdenman||50||I wasn't sure at first I was really seeing parrots in the trees; I was convinced it was a trick of the lights, but nope. Actual parrots. The Albert Memorial, directly across from the Royal Albert hall, is spectacular. The sculpture and the colors are magnificent. Apparently you can book a tour to get up close, but today was not one of those days. On the opposite side of the park is the Marble Arch which used to be at the front of Buckingham Palace. In and of itself, it is not necessarily the most spectacular arch, but to realize how they moved it so far without damaging it is worth the trip to see it.||December 10, 2018
L8633APandyp||40||As we are already in London, and had been told about this event, we went along. Plenty to do for the little ones. Loads of rides and amusements. There are stalls selling trinkets and treasure, if you like that sort of thing, plenty to eat and drink. Very Germanic. Walked our legs off going round, there's that much to see. The food and drink is very pricey, £5 for mulled wine, £5 for a bratty, £9 for fish and chips. Still, worth a visit.||December 10, 2018
Febmiami1||50||perfect place to walk, or run. the hotel was right in front of it and I had breakfast at the bar inside the park, so relaxing||December 10, 2018
MJcatlvr||40||This is something to be seen. The lighted decorations are incredible. Gigantic Carnival, Christmas Market, Music venues and many places to eat and drink. EXTREMELY CROWDED! Don't wear your good shoes too! We visited after some rain and the metal plates that you walk on sometimes shift and muddy water splatters up onto your shoes and pants. Still something for sure to see!||December 10, 2018
Dimitris L||50||We took a walk in Hyde park and it happened to be a really nice ay. It was just lovely walking through the water features with the ducks and other water life, and all the other interesting things you find in this park. It is quite large and good for a walk, a jog, sitting down or just relaxing. We have been here on previous visits to London and this park is still one of our favourites.||December 10, 2018
Anita M||40||Much much bigger than imagined with fountains and statues and lovely open space. Nice atmosphere as the park is filled with tourists, families and locals. Can walk through the park to get to several locations nearby and it is well worth a gentle stroll.||December 10, 2018
gregwilson09||40||Covering about 350 acres of green expanse, Hyde Park is one of eight Royal Parks found in London. Walking distance from Trafalgar Square and Paddington Station, it’s currently the home of Winter Wonderland with all of its bright flashing lights and amusement park rides.When not occupying Winter Wonderland, Hyde Park is often the go-to place for concerts or, in the case of this year’s World Cup, public sporting events. The oldest boating lake is at the foot of the park and there are many grand stone structures and monuments like the Cavalry Memorial. There’s a lot to see and do here, but also offers a simple and enjoyable stroll away from the bustle of the city.||December 9, 2018
tootrue||40||Loved the gardens and wide open spaces, the pond filled with ducks and wildlife were a highlight for us all. It was so nice to be able to walk around without bumping into people like in the city streets. Nice place to relax and take in the views.||December 9, 2018
christW3207RG||50||I stayed at the Montana hotel, which was only 15 minutes by foot away. Ideal place for a walk and to relax. Several locations where you can buy something to eat or drink. I went to the Winterland location in Hyde Park but due to a lack of time I wasn't able to visit Winterland. Maybe next year||December 9, 2018
Jamesjx||50||Had an awesome time with family over the festive season. Enjoyed winter wonderland. Great variety of rides, games and the circus was in town. The big man from the north pole was also in town but he lines to catch a foto with him. ||December 9, 2018
AFAK25||40||I've been to the Hyde Park in Sydney and I've been to the original Hyde Park in London. The one in London is several times larger than Sydney's and plenty of activities are available here, especially when the weather permits.Winter Wonderland is ongoing now on the eastern side of the park.Hyde Park is bounded by Bayswater Road in the north, Park Lane in the east, Kensington in the west and Knightsbridge in the south. All the happening parts of West End are within walking distance from here.||December 9, 2018
Chevalian||50||I have visited Hyde Park more times than I can count over the years. To me it is the perfect central London park: easy transport links, a bit of rough with mature trees, some wide open spaces of flat grass, a boating lake, plentiful wildfowl, a restaurant/cafe. Something for everyone. The added bonus (if its 'your thing') are the annual BST summer open air music festivals, with big name performers. OK so there's no camping facilities but lots of nearby accommodation ranging from basic hostels to swanky hotels. If you want to see Bob Dylan and Neil Young (confirmed for 2019) why go a field in the middle of nowhere when you can go to a field in the middle of London?||December 9, 2018
CyrianaK||50||We made a walk all over the park including winterwonderland. Hyde park is a great place to relax....||December 9, 2018

taz_bubs||40||It’s a lovely large park (the biggest one in London no?). And they occasionally other treats , like opera, in the park during summer ||December 8, 2018
POSHtravelier||50||I most recently have visited this for the Christmas season, Winter Wonderland, which is a "not to miss" attraction. I have also visited this park at other times of year. It is an excellent oasis of calm in the bustling city of London. Except, of course, you are visiting Winter Wonderland, which is anything but a calm oasis! ||December 8, 2018
NURHUDASALIM||50||I have a daughter who loves nature and it was a beautiful sight to have a walk in the morning to see the trees, river, birds and ducks! Very nice location for taking nice photoshoots!||December 7, 2018
Sheene13||50||Hyde Park is the jewel in London's crown. A vast green space with natural wildlife and a place to spend time with family/ friends or just to be alone in peace and tranquility. Big improvements have been made to cycle routes to improve safety. There are fixed and pop up restaurants throughout the site. Many famous landmarks such as speaker's corner, Prince Albert's statue, Peter Pan statue, Princess Diana's memorial. At the right time of year, you'll see some of Her Majesty's mounted Troops rehearsing for the changing of the guard. Not far away are Knighsbridge and High Street Kensington if you like an upmarket shopping experience, and on the northern edge you are close to Notting Hill. Should the weather turn inclement, Queensway skating rink/bowling alley, the Natural History, Science and Victoria and Albert museums are only a short walk away. The walk along the eastern side from Queen Mother's gates takes in Park Lane and Marble Arch. In November every year, Hyde Park is the main starting point for the Bonhams London Brighton Veteran Car run, and if you're more into big concerts, Hyde Park Calling usually takes place in July. The Serpentine Lido and its accompanying paddling pool are great for both adults and children and is open 7 days a week from June to September. You can also watch brave outdoor swimmers compete over the traditional 100 yards distance in the icy waters of the Serpentine Lake at the annual Christmas Day race which has been an ongoing event since 1864. An absolute must for any visitors to London. ||December 7, 2018
vincenzop515||50||Fantastic opportunity to stay aside from the traffic of London for a few hours although it was a bad day I still could enjoy the squirrels and the geese!there was also a Christmas market that my child liked a lot||December 7, 2018

Susan D||50||Hyde Park is a great green area for strolling or jogging , walking, etc. There were alot of dogs, which was nice to see. We spent an evening at Winter Wonderland, which was incredible fun. There were alot of carnival rides and games, and entertainment . The lights were wonderful and we found delicious food at the food stands. Though it was cold, they provide outdoor patio style heating so you can enjoy your food in a warm environment. We had a great time.||December 4, 2018

dkeith||10||Looked for Christmas markets in advance of visiting London and this one seemed to be at the top of our list. I should have read the other reviews noted here in advance. We tried to go on a Friday evening and realized the error of our ways. Large crowds with long lines to get into the event and majority were in the 18-25 age range, few families. We simply left but even the next two nights the crowds were causing pedestrian traffic problems on the nearby tube stations (Hyde Park Corner and Green Park) . When traveling to another event on one of those evenings , we deliberately picked a tube route that bypassed those stations. So a caution if you plan to visit between now and Christmas. To be fair Hyde Park is a lovely park but this event in hardly consistent with The Park’s image.||December 3, 2018
WesleyNewbury||50||Had a lovely trip here with my girlfriend for her birthday, we got very drunk at the various bars. Lots of friends and family told me to make sure you have lots of cash. I was pleasantly surprised when everywhere done contactless payments. ||December 3, 2018

plastx2||50||Had no idea the size of this park. Diana’s memorial is a perpetual running stream of water. It is a flume with a circular-like shape and interesting components. Really beautiful. The pond has swans, ducks and other fowl. There is a restaurant and a food truck offering really great coffees, muffins and sandwiches at reasonable prices. ||December 2, 2018
thdhct||50||Great atmosphere plenty of things for all ages to do free to get in just added extras on the things u want to do if you have kids definitely do the snowman experience that was so good Teletubbies show was great aswell Bar Hütte was fun singing karaoke they didn’t have much of a variety of drinks but the experience was great with friends Rides was fun my little girl loved the swings Santa was great he took the time to have a conversation with my little one and it wasn’t much of a time to wait Ice skating was ok u have to pay £5 extra for penguin also my daughter got given proper skates she just couldn’t cope on the ice so she lasted 10 mins max (my husband had seen the day before on that ice rink small children with special skates on I never knew this) so after doing the 1 lap her falling down loads we went back in n asked if we could have the special ones to which the women said no that’s £5 charge as u should of said when u collected them so it’s ur own fault so I wasn’t going to pay that extra as it already had cost me £7.50 child £9.50 adult ice skating £5 for a penguin so she ended up standing on the side watching me with the penguin coz I wasn’t giving that up I had paid a fiver for that lol Pints of beer/cider are around £6 The lights at night time around the park is beautiful it really does start the Xmas spirit when visiting here defo worth a visit if u can ||December 1, 2018
AntoniaTrip||50||I travel into Paddington and then walk to Piccadilly via Hyde park, it is always a delight. I always walk around the memorial gardens to princess Diana. ||December 1, 2018
Su M||50||Spent the day at Hyde Park. This is our 3rd visit. The stalls food all there and as usual on the expensive side. There are some new shows talks worth seeing but please book early and online to make sure you get to the show if your choice. Also again be prepared to be out of pocket. We went to the snowman which runs every 20 mins but actually is beautifully done. For two adults we paid approx £37. Now this is for a 40 min show in total. However we enjoyed it immensely. The stalls are the same as what we have seen in the last 3 years and the mulled wine is about £6 for a small glass. I said it was expensive. Saying all that. I am glad I wore comfortable shoes and they didn’t mind getting a bit wet as it had been rain g and there were lots of puddles. All part of the experience. Still a lot of fun and having been before we knew what we were letting ourselves in for . Great fun and the rides a varied as well as your fair type stalls. Loved it ||December 1, 2018

Eviesroadtrips||50||We visited the Winter Wonderland fair that is held here for the holiday season. Wow!!We were in awe at the number of concessions, games, and rides. Everything was of nice quality (not a cheap, run-down carnival). Be ready for throngs of people, but definitely a fun atmosphere. Entry is free, and you buy tickets for rides and pay for concessions, souvenirs etc. Foods include pancakes, bratwursts, tacos, churros, hot chocolate, and much more!||November 28, 2018
Yolyni||50||A great feeling, a unique experience walking in this beautiful park in the heart ofLondon. Walk by the lake, take photos with the ducks ! We love walking from Harrods to Marble Arch/ Oxford through the park. And during Christmas period, winter wonderland is a great amusement park. ||November 28, 2018
Marko74Fin||30||I was there during February and it was snowing. Some of the trees were without leaves which means this park wasn't very attractive. There was still some parrots and also ducks and swans. Because it was snowing the park was very quiet.||November 28, 2018
Linda N||40||It was a Monday afternoon when we strolled through Hyde Park, having entered from Kensington Gardens. This is a wonderful lung near the centre of London and has lots to wonder at, including the Diana memorial and of course Prince Albert memorial. There are squirrels galore, so tame and coming up to us looking for feeding. It was quite nice and peaceful when we were there and we could reflect on previous times with ones who are now departed.||November 28, 2018
FORZA7777||40||This parc is even more beautiful than Green parc. The autumn colors are extremely beautiful. You can easily take a big walk in this parc!||November 27, 2018
Madjude||50||We visited early in the morning. Lovely city park with great cycling and walking roads. The trees are loosing their leaves at the moment which just added to the wintery feel. Plenty of park benches to sit and people watch if having a jog around it’s your thing. Very busy in the mornings with locals cycling through on their way to work. ||November 27, 2018
Αγάπη Μ||50||definitely one of the most impressive places. you have to find the chance and the time of course,cause it's big enough, to visit and spend a morning/evening,have a relaxing coffee in front of lake's view. walk around the paths , have a picnic and don't forget to visit the nearby museums!!||November 27, 2018
normann975||50||I really do love the outdoors and this is one of the places I would come back.The view is stunning, relaxing and nice place to come with family, solo or couples just to enjoy everything.The leaves that covered the entire area made it even more beautiful.||November 26, 2018
AbhishekS4354||40||well it is not a typical park what one would think of a park.. it is really very big ..be sure which gate you would want to enter and leave.this was my second visit but what i found much lesser people in. it was probably due to cold whether ..but definitely worth visit to escape all the madness of city life ..||November 26, 2018
Charles_and_Susan||40||This time we went for the Winter Wonderland which is in the Hyde Park Corner area. It seems much bigger this time than when we went previously. Free to walk round with lots of food and attractions. ||November 26, 2018
hinoonhoki||50||We went for a morning jog (more often than not it was walking) through Hyde Park. Wow, what and expansive and beautiful park. I particularly liked the balance between man made and managed, and the landscape not cluttered with park equipment and chunks of metallic structure. Also liked the nod to the past with the provision of sculptures. The most unusual thing was swimmers in the lake and the water was around 8 degrees. Hardy people who join up to the Serpintine Club for the priviledge. ||November 26, 2018
MeganSophiaWhite||50||Our hotel was right beside this park It’s so animal friendly They have squirrels who come right up to you begging for lil nuts. Some green bird things and such amazing friendly dogs. And ducks of course I would recommend wrapping up warm as the place is huge full of beautiful monuments and fountains etc Live this place we walked in here every daySuch a beautiful park ||November 26, 2018
eastyge||40||Interesting park to walk through. Chipmunks and birds everywhere, nice place to have lunch, see the animals.||November 26, 2018
OhioMomOf1||50||If you want to get away from the city and spend a couple of hours relaxing in nature, head to Hyde Park. Rent bikes, walk the paths, or spend time by the lake. I would recommend Hyde Park to anyone looking to find some down time during their vacation to London.||November 25, 2018
Dodge1991||50||We walked through Hyde Park to get to Kensington Palace rather than going around the park, and we were glad we did!The whole park was quiet and calm despite being quite busy, green everywhere and just a great atmosphere.||November 25, 2018
Danny M||50||Love Hyde park. Such a inspirational green space in London. Lovely cafe by the lake. Great for a walk or me time to get away. Just go.||November 25, 2018
dogmantraveller||40||We really enjoyed our time in Hyde Park. It’s deceptively large and you can spend a lot of time there. Beautiful trees, ponds and animals, and a great place to people watch. Walked to Kensington palace and just enjoyed the ambience. ||November 25, 2018
JoeNathan9249||50||Vast array of things to see and do here. In corner is the Primcess Diana playground, which many youngsters will enjoy. There are huge lawns to picnic, memorials like th one to Prince Albert, ponds and much more. Entrance to the park is free - but you have to pay to do some things (like visit the Kensington Palace, which is at one end)I suggest looking at a map of the park before you make plans as the park is huge.||November 25, 2018
Steve262||50||Went to se the Winter Wonderland. It was very magical, only let down by the bag searches at the entrance that confiscated all drinks, forcing you to pay overinflated prices inside, and the astronomical cost of the funfair. We enjoyed ourselves however.||November 25, 2018
AmolakRattanK||50||One of the finest destination in the World for any tourists, you can bet on its beauty and wonderful environment. We love to go there every time we are in London. This place is a natural attraction and we love to walk, sit and relax and enjoy our breakfast. The enclosed photos can explain everything.Amolak Rattan Kohli Former Governor of Mizoram||November 25, 2018
lynnesharan||50||Love being here. So many directions to walk in so much beauty. There is water, trees, fountains, flowers, people riding bikes, skateboards, scooters, walking, running, horseback riding and some like me simply sitting and contemplating. You can shop TIL you drop and then escape to a nature sanctuary. A must visit for oldies and newcomers to London. ||November 24, 2018
waleedhashim||50||If you love the pleasures of being in a big city, then you love London. What's not to love: theatres, restaurants, shows, shopping, markets & more.However, I do need peace and quiet in order to meditate and to me Green Park and Hyde Park are my top two favourite meditation spots in London respectively.If you enjoy really long walks, then Hyde Park is the one for you. I enjoyed a good 45 minutes walk across the park filled with the contrast of the lush greenery against the autumn fall leaves. With ducks, swans and squirrels greeting you along the way, a stroll in Hyde Park is a must to make any London trip complete.||November 24, 2018
Swatiib||50||This place has a super awesome vibe in london. It is a must visit specially on a bright sunny day. One must enjoy the greenery looking at the swams in the lake||November 24, 2018

Mark H||40||As a family we went for a walk through the park and the highlight for us was walking through where the squirrels were. The lakes with all their bird life as well as the Princess Diana memorial were all enjoyable.||November 23, 2018
Melissa R||50||Hyde Park is huge - it is like the equivalent of Central Park in NYC...it has swans, a Princess Diana memorial, there's events going on, a scenic bridge, trails, etc. A must see when visiting London!||November 23, 2018

Explorer70447||50||Spent several days wondering around this Park. Didn’t realise how big it was. Fabulous monuments, Italian gardens, large pool with over 100 swans. ||November 20, 2018
Petre2017476||50||It is one of the most beautiful public parks, because it is well-known and has a great variety of species, which have a special color in autumn. Also on the lake are many bird species, starting with races, gis and pelicans. You have to spend at least an hour in this park||November 20, 2018
MobileMo15||50||A beautiful park to stroll around on a crisp Autumn Sunday Morning to blow away the cobwebs. Would highly recommend.||November 20, 2018
barcaranger||50||London has so many great parks from small beautiful parks like Waterlow to the Hughes ones like Regents Park and Hyde Park. They make London habitable and clean the air allowing children to play and run off steam. In the summer it’s full of sun bathers. One thing not to miss is Speakers Corner the complete definition of free speech in the U.K. ||November 19, 2018
Dholakia2014||50||This huge park is a green jewel in central London. Wonderfully maintained. The serpentile lake and beautiful ducks add charm to this serene wonder. We missed the speaker corner as it was odd time. Next time we wish to spend a whole day here||November 19, 2018
Destinationtoexcel||50||Been quite a few times as I work beside this area. Great to go for along walk. The lake with the swans and cafe is really anazing. It's a 15 mins walk from Marble Arch end of the Hyde park is a must visit for anyone who has no been here. Beautifully maintained and full of nice crowd.||November 19, 2018
VABON i||50||A peaceful and beautiful place, we had a long walk in the beautiful hyde park and we arrived all the way near marble arch. plenty of photos taken to follow!||November 19, 2018
danielrwalsh||50||This is a beautiful laid out and well maintained park in the heart of London. Again as I have often said on previous reviews do not for one moment think that you will see everything n this park in one day. It cannot be done. As previously said when planning a trip to London or the UK in general, do plan your trip. Make two lists. List one is for things you MUST see and do. The second list is for the "Would be nice to see". I have lived in London since 1988 and I am still finding little treasures to this day.The park itself is beautiful. If you approach from the Kensington entrance you cannot but see the Royal Albert Hall, a very busy Entertainment centre named after Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria who died young and this was venue built and named after him, by her. Across from this entrance you will also see a statue of Queen Victoria herself seated on her throne. There are many many entrances to this park all with their own special features nearby. If you enter from the Marble Arch entrance, you cannot miss the Marble Arch itself which is located at the entrance of Edgware Road, the longest urban road in the UK. It goes from Marble Arch (the A5) to Spur Road in Edgware, some 10 miles. Do not get confused by the fact that there is a London Underground Station called Edgware Road which is not too far from Marble Arch. There is another London Underground Station called Edgware which is at the end of the Northern Line (The Black line on the London Underground Map) This Northern Line does have another terminus and tubes which are very frequent but do check where they terminate.Getting back to Hyde Park, the lake in the centre of the Park is called the Serpentine where you can sit and watch the world go by. There are a number of notable features such as the Diana memorial, there are Art Galleries and vast areas to walk on the grass or the pathways. One final note for you and your amusement on Sunday Mornings at the Marble Arch entrance to the Park is Speakers Corner. This is where ANYONE with an opinion on anything can stand up and where his or her thoughts and philosophy on any subject matter which may be near and dear to his or her heart. One notable exception is NO ONE can speak ill of her Majesty, the Queen.Enjoy London and do follow my blog on Food, Travel and cooking & baking called Daniels dinners. There is also a website with the suffix .co.uk||November 19, 2018
lindkaa||50||Walked a little way through Kensington gardens across Rotton Row around the corner was Princess Diana’s memorial fountain.Walked along the beautiful Serpentine river for a good way. The Park is massive, I have been there many, many times and have never yet seen it’s entirety. We monitored our walk and we did 6 miles that day. There are people picnicking, joggers, cyclists, people under trees sleeping, children playing games, people like us just strolling, people sitting on benches reading or having their lunch, people feeding the ducks. Plenty of places to rest or eat. What would Londoners do without Hyde Park ?||November 19, 2018
Amy F||50||I recently visited Hyde Park and it's really beautiful and well-kept. It's very nice to walk in and I found it very peaceful.||November 19, 2018

46smitap||50||If you are a park lover and love being close to nature you cannot miss Hyde park.Spread across a large area right in the centre you just cannot skip it. One end of the park is the Oxford street and Marble arch where you can enjoy your shopping and the other end takes you to the buckingham palace. A really green and well maintained park. Has many benches to have a sitdown and have your picnic.||November 18, 2018
Ian B||50||beautiful park. So much too see, close to Kennsington palace and knightsbridge. Great for picnics safe to walk||November 18, 2018

MULCASTER2||50||Hyde park is nothing less than a magical place. Full of the wildlife and a perfectly groomed greenery, the Pearl has lots to offer. Meandering through here on a sunny afternoon watching the squirrels play and people just connecting with each other is magical. You just love the space in an otherwise madly busy London||November 17, 2018
Mike A||50||Was visiting London with my wife and we enjoy walking. While out on a bus tour we decided it was time for a walk and this was the place to walk. It is very relaxing and refreshing. It almost makes you feel like you are not in a city with millions of people.||November 17, 2018
mejsej80||50||its a must place to visit when you visit London. it will be better to visit it in the summer or spring.||November 16, 2018
bill999rta||30||We entered via Hyde Park Corner and noticed the “Legalise Cannabis” stand by the entrance. Several people appeared to think that the law had already changed as we noticed the sickly odour of cannabis several times. The same attitude also appeared to apply to cycling. Despite the presence of marked cycle lanes, numerous people cycled wherever they chose despite the No Cycling Signs making walking hazardous. What’s the point of trying to create safe areas for pedestrians by creating no cycling areas and putting up signs, if nobody is going to enforced it?. It was also disappointing to see so many people focused on the iphones and not on the surroundings. Many were not even looking where they’re going, which when you’re close to a lake or careless cyclists is not a good idea.The park itself is excellent, supporting plenty of foliage and wildlife including the water fowl and Ring-necked Parakeets.||November 16, 2018
Matthew P||50||Spring, Summer, Autumn or Winter Hyde Park is a place to come. Whether you hang out around the Serpentine, check out the rants and raves of the "Speakers Corner" contingent or just enjoy the walk ways and green space in the heart of the City you are assured of an enjoyable experience.||November 16, 2018

claudinehere||50||Hyde Park is a stunning park, a wonderful patch of green space in the middle of the city. There is a wide open space for strolling and for kids to run around.

springlering||50||Our hotel was fairly close, so we spent several mornings enjoying the park, the changing leaves (beautiful!), the Italian garden, and feeding the parakeets. Just a pleasant place to walk and savor, and enjoy the local kids and dogs. ||November 15, 2018

Debbiebain71||50||Had a relaxing walk through through the park. There were people out with their dogs. And the figs were loving it. Chasing balls and squirrels. This was my first time seeing squirrels they were super cute. Lots of action and activities happening in the park from feeding the swans and boating to people having a picnic. We headed for afternoon tea at Kensington palace ||November 15, 2018
redmel2017||50||Hyde Park is a big place. When I visited it wasn’t overly crowded and there was plenty of places to walk to. The place is filled with squirrels, swans and other animals. So have you phones out handy to take pictures. I did find a café, but found the prices to be a little too much. So next time I will be bringing my own thermos filled with tea.||November 15, 2018

We walked along the Serpentine from Lancaster Gate to Knightsbridge and this walk gives tremendous views of the water, trees and some of the surrounding architecture. The Princess Diana memorial fountain is closed for its annual maintenance.||November 11, 2018
MariaDOliveira||40||if they want to see squirrels go. it is very pleasant to stay but the kensington palace park is much nicer and beautiful, so if you go to hyde park go to kensington because it is worth it as you see the ducks on kensington lake.here also to a lake where you can do canoeing, we did not go but it seemed very pleasant. It's also a nice place to have a picnic||November 10, 2018

Discover23024072244||50||The park itself is vast, and is the site for many important occasions, such as the above and the Pope's visit last year, as well as completely different events - the Hyde Park concerts take place here every summer, bringing lots of people together to share in their love of music.Great place to hang out and people watch. If you're lucky there will be a concert going on. Also if the weather is nice take along a picnic. Hard to believe it is in the middle of such a bustling city.||November 9, 2018

Kim O||50||I love my occasional visits to the Lodge Cafe for excellent coffee, the lovely view of the park and warm welcome by staff. It can often be busy and the service is quick, efficient and with little time to hang around for a chit-chat. But when it is not too busy there is always that nice conversation with whoever is behind the counter. Good weather offers a great outdoor seating space under a wide canape of an old mulberry tree, while in chillier weather the cafe has a cosy indoor space. You’ll find quite a variety of food, serving e vegan palate as well and I love the mulled wine with mince pie on a cold winters’ day. Thanks for a great service and keep up the good work!||November 9, 2018

Paul T||50||Given my wife and I were staying across the street of course we spent a lot of time in Hyde Park. I would say it is my 2nd favorite park in London, after Regent's Park. In our 10 day visit we were able to do a full loop walking and also rented bikes and did most of a loop by bike. We also spent time at the Round Pond on our arrival and departure days. I would say highlights include the wiggly walk and Diana garden north of Kensington Palace, the Round Pond, the paddle boats on the river, Marble Arch, the central water fountains, the vista from the arch statue to Kensington palace, the south flower walk and the status across from Royal Albert Hall. It took us about 2 hours to walk the full outer loop and you can rent bikes for 30 minute increments. We were able to make it from the Queensway entrance around to the Lancanster Gate entrance in just under 30 minutes by bike. For the bikes, you must pay by card and will be charged another 4 pounds if you don't have them back on a rack within 30 minutes. However, we enjoyed a nice ride and I would say it was worth it. Note that the park gates will be locked soon after sun down and you will have to find one of the gates with a turn style to exit after that.Overall Hyde Park is a great place for a relaxing walk in the center of London, and while it can be busy with runners and bikes you can always find a nice spot to relax.||November 8, 2018
amirar986||50||During the Christmas season, there will be winter wonderland at hyde park, there are many attractions there, like roller coaster, haunted house etc. We need to pay for each attraction at the booth for the paper tokens. ||November 7, 2018
Deb C||50||Hyde Park is big enough that the whole family can find something fun to do, whether it's visiting the swans in the many water features, to the children's play areas to just finding a lovely bench under a tree and reading a good book. And if you're into people-watching, it's a blast. Go to Kensington Palace at one end and the Italian Gardens and fountains at the other - either way, Hyde Park is a London treasure. Much like Central Park in NY, it's a haven away from the hustle and noise of the city.||November 7, 2018
carolina_nat||50||The park is elegant any time of year and provides a welcome break from the commerce and traffic which surround if. During early November, when we were there, the fall seasonal leaf change was at its height and the park was slow with color even on the inevitable gray rainy days. I love this park, and the people there are so quiet t and considerate.||November 7, 2018
zippy_vdV||50||I love walking through Hyde park as its one of my favourite parks in London from birds to trees to being in the middle of London you are close to shopping, restaurants. Its a park within a city that you can either walk, ride your bike, sit aand let your mind wander as you listen to the birds.Just Perfect||November 7, 2018

Lynne M||50||The park is big with lots of trails for walking or running. Got to watch Europeans endless fascination for squirrels here. Everytime we saw a squirrel there was someone taking its photo.||November 6, 2018

wojciechl655||50||... but I think not only autumn. A place conducive to walks, relaxation, reflection. Beautiful trees, birds, squirrels, diverse people, calmness... BTW, no speaker in speakers corner ... maybe next time :-) ||November 6, 2018
JulesW18||40||We ended up here when trying to get away from the busy centre that had become a bit overwhelming. It was lovely to wonder around after all of the hustle and bustle, especially with the autumn colours. There’s a few things to do here as well, with tennis, boats, cafes, the Diana memorial and ducks to feed. We did seem to come out of it covered in bird poo but we must have been unlucky there. Very nice and will pro try to take a bit longer here next time.||November 5, 2018
jfadds||40||Much less vitriolic compared to decades past, this endures as a classic London experience. The day we visited, it was much delayed due to marathon race run that morning.Once started, it was business as usual ,with some orators talking to the wind while others drew large crowds of onlookers ||November 5, 2018
Foxy M||50||I have been here several times and always find it a pleasure to visit. Look out for red and grey squirrels.||November 5, 2018
staceyw779||50||We are staying just north of the park in Kensington and have walked through the park multiple while making our way around. The park is massive but there are dozens of paths and walks to cut through in different directions. Lots of dogs running around (which I love), plenty of benches along the main paths, markers to direct you to the big attractions as well. The colors right now are stunning....there are a couple of pondslittle lakes with ducks and swans (biggest swans I have ever seen)...they are pretty domesticated as well. Several fountains and some of Princess Diana's gardens and fountains along the way as well. Each trip has yielded some beautiful new sites, highly recommend a few hours walking through the park.||November 4, 2018

D5958EMdavid||50||We just love this park. London is lucky to have amazing open spaces, in my opinion this is the best,any time of year is a great time to stroll through the park. We get the train to Marylebone and walk to the park either to the museums or Royal Albert Hall||November 4, 2018
Cazziii||40||Lovely park, beautiful grounds and gates. Well worth a walk around if you are in the area. A picnic in the park is great.||November 4, 2018

Gordon B||50||Plenty to see and do in the park. Running of course is for me the primary reason. Visited the Memorial to Princess Diane, walked about and generally escaped the hussle and bustle of the city for a short while.||November 3, 2018
naughtynak||50||After days of sightseeing and shopping in this lovely city , this park which is just around the corner from the main shopping street is a relaxed park to sit down and relax. You can catch up with friends. Read books, walk , jog and be one with nature. ||November 3, 2018

MHnurse30||50||In London today for a conference and walked from Paddington to the venue across Hyde Park. Lovely autumn day so very pleasant. I was rather taken by the wild parakeets everywhere! Great for a walk and spotted a little cafe by the serpentine which looked good. ||October 31, 2018

VivianMac71||50||A beautiful Green Space in all the chaos.We came here to catch our breath and relax for a couple of hours before throwing ourselves back into the Melee of London again.What a fantastic place, so well taken care of and a lot bigger than we expected.Amazing statues, and rollerblading lessons were taking place as we walked around.Check out speakers corner & a walk round the lake especially with all the autumn colours was just the tonic we needed.Highlight of our visit were the Parrots, what wonderful creatures.Blissful.||October 31, 2018
Gill H||50||Amazing wildlife in this park, great for bird lovers. We followed part of the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Walk, walked around the Memorial Fountain & admired the Serpentine. Autumn is a great time to visit as all of the colourful trees looked beautiful. Lido Café & Bar not over priced for tea/coffee. Adjacent toilets free to use & very clean. Great place to take kids if you want a quiet inexpensive afternoon in London.||October 30, 2018

Canmoreab||50||What a beautiful park, so many people enjoying it with their dogs which I have to say are very well behaved. The ducks, swans and an assortment of birds is a bird lovers paradise. Especially the Egyptian Goose so pretty. A definite must see.||October 29, 2018

Trail818740||50||Don't under estimate how big Hyde Park is and give yourself time to wander around. Princess Dianna memorial fountain was lovely and made my Husband walk further as I wanted to visit the Peter Pan statue. Loved the Squirrels.||October 28, 2018
robertmK6898CW||50||A walk through the park is always pleasant (not only in summer-time). The Serpentine and park grounds are relaxing and you can even end up forgetting you’re in the middle of the most beautiful city in the world. ||October 28, 2018
Janeinplymouth||50||Hyde Park is especially gorgeous in the autumn, it is such a peaceful place, despite how close it is to so much activity, there is lots to do if a simple walk is not enough, but there is a lot to be said for an autumn walk in the woods - and Hyde Park gives you that in th heart of the City.||October 28, 2018
maxg115||50||Took a lovely walk through this park. Found the Princess Diana memorial fountain, the statue of Isis and the Statue to Peter Pan. Encountered the most extravagant Ice Cream Truck and encountered two of the parks feral, but cute, pests ( the grey squirrel and the Indian Ring Neck Parrots). So lovely to have such a huge green space in such a large and populace city.||October 28, 2018
Abdul M||50||If you are in London and want to do something that doesn't cost anything, then go to Hyde Park! It is a nice walk, explore, and just enjoy the fresh air. Have a picnic, share, run around with your kids, walk towards the museums and just give yourself time. This is a place to get away from all the busy things we need to do and just step outside in the open sky and walk. I highly recommend the place, do enjoy!||October 27, 2018
Cat L||50||We had an excellent walk through Hyde Park. It was relaxing and entertaining. We were amazed by the green parrots flying through the park.||October 26, 2018
djinnooi||40||My sixth trip to London, but my first to Hyde Park. After some drizzly and overcast days, we enjoyed being outdoors in this green oasis, strolling over from Kensington Gardens. We enjoyed walking around the Diana Memorial Fountain, beside the Serpentine and the views to Kensington Palace through the Henry Moore sculpture (technically in Kensington Gardens, but why quibble over details?)Would love to explore other areas of Hyde Park, but they’ll have to wait for another trip. Allow more than an hour to see the park properly and enjoy the sights. ||October 26, 2018
mediumdebyo||50||In the midst of Busy London, Hyde Park is a lovely oasis of peace. Lots to see and do though as well. Even driving through a Hyde Park is a pleasure. It’s super central, easy to get to and there is always something to do or see there. ||October 26, 2018
dotdoctor2002||40||walked through on a late Sunday afternoon was amazed to see so many people enjoying it. there were families, couples., joggers all out for an afternoon stroll. flowers are beautifully maintained....there are statues and paths to explore....oasis in the middle of the city||October 25, 2018

Stephanie E||50||I could not get enough of this park. It is beautiful and a lovely break from the hustle and bustle of the city. Rent bikes to explore (but be sure to remain on cycling paths as some are only for pedestrians). It is a gorgeous park. ||October 24, 2018
benmN7579FC||50||Alongside the heart of London the capital of England this stunning park has lots to see and do with concerts etc. It has a great lake and gardens to see along with museums on the perimeter!!||October 23, 2018
BrettE601||50||When I go to London I always take my run kit. Hyde Park is excellent place for a run on or off the tarmac.||October 23, 2018
Joseph T||50||You could wander this park for hours under the illusion that your in the north country somewhere walking in open fields. As a New Yorker, I'm tempted to compare this to Central Park, but Hyde Park is much more open with wider vistas and very few tall buildings in the distance to dispel you of the pleasant illusion of a country stroll. Worth the time either walking or people watching from a nice bench. ||October 23, 2018
chrissyblue2018||40||Have been to this park many times...wonderful park, beautiful big open space for picnics, kids playing||October 23, 2018
dreamspeaker||40||This park is nice. I don't think it's the nicest park I saw in London (I adored St James's Park), but it is definitely the largest I saw. I liked the area closest to Buckingham Palace best because of the flower gardens and wonderful trees.The cafe by the Long Water is nice for a coffee and some millionaire shortbread. The long water is indeed very long and the serpentine path was nice. I enjoyed the swans in the Long Water, and the Diana Memorial Fountain. This made for a nice, if long, walk from Buckingham Palace to Kensington Palace for us.||October 22, 2018
evaevoula||50||its a very large green park.with a big lake...i loved the swans and the chipmunks....its a nice and peaceful place...||October 22, 2018

Jessica G||50||My husband and I strolled through here on our walking of London. Like the other parks in London the place draws a lot of birds. They were lounging in the lake. It was beautiful. The grounds were well taken care of and the place wasn't too busy (except a little around the lake).||October 22, 2018

Paul B||40||The 140-hectare Hyde Park is probably the most famous park in London and lies just west of the center.Until 1536, the area was owned by Westminster Abbey.Then Henry VIII took over the park as a hunting ground and until now it is still in the hands of the British royal family.Hyde park is an oasis of peace in a hectic city and ideal for relaxing in a green environment.Regularly there are pop concerts, sporting events and cultural events.Furthermore, the elongated Serpentine Lake in the middle of the park and the famous 'Speakers Corner' on the northeast side are also part of the park.Of course, admission is free.||October 22, 2018
Kirstine C||50||We are so lucky to have this park at the top of our street, there is nowhere more breath taking to stroll around, on a sunny autumn afternoon than Hyde Park||October 21, 2018

GMM0||50||London is such a green city with park after gorgeous park in the midst of the city. Just love all the green space! Hyde Park is my favorite of the city parks, with the lovely gardens, water and boating, places to stop for a bite, many walking and biking paths. Spent our favorite day in London just walking all the parks. Fantastic!||October 21, 2018

727tracyw||50||I love Hyde Park. To think that some of the plants and trees may date back to when the park was established in 1536 blows my mind. It's also free to visitI'm a walker and I love the different pathways that you can walk along. I enjoy looking at the different landscape, the sculptures, and memorials.You can go for a run, walk, take a boat trip on the Serpentine, sit on a bench, or one of the lounhe chairs (which cost money).||October 21, 2018
TravelManagerLoveIt||50||Attended the Barclay Summer Series concert with Michael Buble, Van Morrison, Bananarama just to name a few in July. The park is lovely to wander around in the summer, but the lack of rain meant it wasn't in its spectacular greenery as I'm used to. The set up for the music festival was fantastic and the Great Oak Stage set up in the park was really clever. Just meandering through the park is a must when visiting London, but to catch world-class entertainment with tens of thousands of others here is a massive bonus! Despite the rain hanging around most of the concert, it was fantastic. Just make sure you're armed with extra rain ponchos before you go!||October 20, 2018
DavetheFisher||50||We visited on a sunny October afternoon and it was full of people enjoying the park. It was very clean (apart from the swan poop near the lake), everyone cleaning up after themselves and their dogs.It is surprisingly huge so give yourself plenty of time to get around.||October 20, 2018
chandalynb||50||These trees are amazing. So big and old and well maintained. Everyone was just relaxing reading or laying on a blanket. And to think this was Henry the eighths hunting ground!!!||October 20, 2018

mike e||50||Hyde park is a special place that Londoners enjoy to the fullest. It is also the park we have the most personal history in. It is common for us to close out the trip there for instance. The Italian Gardens are our favorite part, and with the Rolls Royce ice cream car parked next to it, well, how cool is that. The lake beyond the gardens is pretty large and offers some fine picture ops. The bird life and swans are calming, and everyone is happy here, I even don't mind the bloody joggers here. The park closes around 8 or 9 pm and they lock it up and sort of roll out the last visitors as smoothly as possible. We sort of closed it out a couple nights. The park supposedly is open until midnight, but not in my experience, they lock the gates so more don't get in around 9pm I think. If you are already in the park, perhaps you can stay till midnight I guess. Sit down somewhere and watch some dogs playing or just people watch, Hyde Park is just the thing to wind down or picnic in.||October 16, 2018
wk k||50||The Swans at the pool, the swaying tress as well as the occasional flying birds are all opening big arms to welcome the visitors. I personally feel so relaxed walking on the pavement from one end to another. Certainly a great place to visit.||October 16, 2018
567dales||50||We stayed near Hyde Park doing our recent visit to London and found the park to be an amazing spot. We had previously walked through the park on another visit and wanted to experience it again. It truly is a wonderful park in the heart of London.||October 16, 2018
paulines42||50||My daughter and I walked around Hyde park on Saturday in glorious sunshine. We took photos by the fountains and had a relaxing drink at the cafe in the park.

ranjanapathak||40||Hyde Park London is just like central park in New York. All can enjoy here. A lake, trees, roses, grass lawns, walking and jogging paths, restaurants, children play area - all are quite refreshing. Near by are many attractions and prime markets, so we enjoyed many things in one go in a day.||October 16, 2018

nak3n||40||In the middle of a very busy and crowded city, the park is refreshing. Lots of grass, open spaces, a lake, and a huge monument. Good for a run. Could be good for children. Also, includes Kensington Palace. Not good for dogs. ||October 15, 2018

CTMans||40||Walked the entire perimeter of Hyde Park and adjacent Kensington Gardens. Even on a marginal weather day, there were loads of people walking children and/or dogs. Horses on occasion. Swans, ducks, squirrels, birds everywhere. Speakers' Corner was quiet. Very pleasant.||October 15, 2018
David M||40||We stayed at a hotel on the edge of the park, near the first Lancaster gate. This worked out great because we could walk through the park headed to various sightseeing destinations. We walked to Buckingham and Kensington palaces, the Victoria & Albert museum, There are several nice places to eat in the park, we had breakfast and lunch at different locations. It can feel very crowded in London so walking in the park really allowed us to relax and get away from the crowds.||October 15, 2018
oborozuki||50||Since we had spent loads of time inside museums in London, when the weather turned sunny and bright, in late September, we decided to spend our last full day, with my wife’s British cousin, simply walking in the marvelous parks of this great city. We are all three walkers, so it was not difficult to walk the 13 miles we totaled on that bright, sunny day. We began by walking in Kensington Gardens which was just north of our hotel in South Kensington (The Rembrandt) along the Serpentine and into Hyde Park, to the Wellington Arch and into Green Park, and finally into lovely, St James Park. These are wonderful parks full of big, beautiful trees all kinds of species of trees. In Hyde park there are 105 different types of trees in all. The main varieties are London plane trees, Norway maples, Hawthorn, English oak, Horse chestnut and Sweet chestnut, common Lime trees, Ash, and Silver Birch. About 30% of the trees are other, more exotic species, mulberry, cypress, Hop hornbeam, Zelkova. But the most famous tree in Hyde Park is the so called upside down tree, or Weeping Beech (Fagus sylvatica pendula)—it is a sight to behold and to enter into like a hobbit’s den. There is also the marvelous Christo- Jeanne Claude “London mustaba” (a pyramid with the top cut off) made of 7506 barrels on the serpentine lake. Unfortunately, when you read this it will have already been taken down.||October 15, 2018
321sandrad||50||Great park lots of space and you can grab a coffee tea and something to eat from the outdoor cafe by the tube station. Walk you dogs and have a picnic. It’s lovely to just walk through especially changing of the seasons with the leaves changing colours ||October 15, 2018

curlyKar24||50||We wandered through on a perfectly sunny September day. After seeing the most lovely Kensington Palace, and wandering past many lovely birds and foul, we found Princess Diana's Memorial Fountain which was lovely. The park itself was kept so well. So many little pathways, and pretty water views. Wish I could visit here more often. ||October 15, 2018
Wendell D||50||Every year, just south of Hyde Park’s Serpentine lake along the road to the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Serpentine Gallery erects a temporary pavilion designed by a notable architect it has selected.

jehenson81||40||Hyde park was just as lovely as its neighbor Kensington Gardens and was busy on a rainy Sunday. This appears to be because they were doing a half marathon which made me happy I had visited so early. They have lots of green space and nice pathways. They just need more signs so you go in the right direction (I went the wrong way again). ||October 14, 2018

Cosmopolitan808778||40||We Spent probably an hour wandering through Hyde Park. I loved seeing the squirrels & I was amazed at how many there were. As it was a beautiful hot sunny day in October, we sat on a bench beside the lake. Unfortunately we noticed a man at the next bench who seemed to be exposing himself to passers by. I didn’t see anyone in authority to mention this too. He is probably a harmless individual but it was not a pleasant experience.||October 14, 2018

Smokeynav||50||Our hotel was just down the street, and we didn't leave for the airport until 1 p.m. We walked to Kensington Place, but didn't tour (??? I don't know why we didn't, but my bride was the time keeper and kept us pressing on) We walked around the Serpentine Lake, viewed and walked the Italian Gardens, found the loo...(you need twenty pence to go)...just a beautiful and relaxing place!||October 14, 2018
emcarter||50|| We saw the guards exercising the horses in Hyde Park. Also it is a short walk to Kensington Palace and there you see a collection of Lady Diana's gowns. There are places to eat in the park and we had breakfast in the park on 2 occasions.||October 14, 2018

thebellyisreal||50||Beautiful big green space, useful for everything from exercise to picnics. Why not get in mouthful of fresh air . Worth a visit ||October 14, 2018
CatherineHabbie||40||The green lungs of London, Hyde park is an amazing stretch of green in the hear today the city. Although tbis summer saw the lawns yellow when compared to the earlier years, it is still a delight to be in. One can walk through it quickly to reach Buckingham palace and cut through to perch oneself on the park walls for a vantage view of the Change of Guard( check timings in advance) In summer, one can see deck chairs lined up and people soaking in the sunlight.There can never be too much of vitamin D for London or can there?The blast of oxygen can leave one refreshed as one walks through it at any time of the day.||October 14, 2018
Olga P||50||Its an Oasis in the middle of the city chaos! Swans and ducks and scuertles, boats to rent, and the horse ride. Visit during the Day hours.||October 14, 2018
Greg K||30||What a lovely sanctuary from the hustle and biustle of the city. While there are a lot of people in the park, it does not feel like it, and it is easy to feel alone and in peace no matter where you are. i would reccomend you going here to just take a break||October 13, 2018
kate m||50||a.fantastic place for a liesurely stroll Lots of interesting wildlife on the lake ,colourful flowerbeds and a huge variety of trees.A good place for people watching with horse riders,rollerblading and other activities to watch||October 13, 2018
davidgT8084GN||50||One of the nicest parks I’ve been to. Nice place to go for a walk and see some natural things in a bustling city. If you like, take an apple that is cut in half. Hold it in your hand and the parakeets will land on your arm to eat the apple. They are gentle so don’t be afraid ||October 13, 2018
joyce c||50||love hyde park, but went to see the serpentine and was really cool. but dunno if i can say fits but was cool. ||October 13, 2018
icu4biz||40||Love during Christmas market. Check out schedule during weekends for concerts and other activities. Great place for runners. ||October 13, 2018
Hansen, D||50||I always enjoy a stroll or a jog in Hyde Park, and it is great to see the changing of the season here. With the warm autumn weather this year, it seems that everybody is out here - families, couples enjoying the calmness around Diana’s memorial, studying the birds and squirrels, walking their dog, riding a horse or simply going for a walk. Until September it was even possible to swim. Such a nice oasis in the bustling city.||October 13, 2018
Arn E||40||Hyde Park is twinned with Kensington Gardens and together they make up a large green area, with birds, vast lawns, trees - which were in full autumn colours - and artificial lakes. A nice peaceful place to walk, and a convenient throughfare between parts of the town.||October 13, 2018
andrewkaraviotis||50||A great spot to walk with your friends or if you are more sportive person, I recommend it to go for a running. I nice place to relax.||October 13, 2018
MickCJones||50||Great Park, for a nice walk or a run ! Right in the heart of London beautiful lake with boats you can hire, pathways to stroll, green areas for kids to play, coffee shops, even a bowling green and Tennis courts, plenty to do, just stones throw away from Oxford street ,Bond Street for world class shopping.||October 13, 2018
1224pinkhart||40||This park is home to the Princess Diana fountain and playground. It's a nice walkable park, but St. James Park is nicer, in my opinion.||October 12, 2018
cc1Canada||40||A beautiful fall day in London spent in the park while all the flowers are still in bloom. The Lady Diana fountain is a beautiful tribute to her many and varied ways of witnessing and bringing presence to the people. Lots of wild life as well! ||October 12, 2018
hanknj||50||Wonderful park to stroll and see Albert Memorial, Diana Memorial and several other memorial. Great to walk to lake area and sit or purchase food and drink items. ||October 12, 2018
77Leah77||50||We were there on a Sunday when Christo's Barrels were still on the lake - an amazing installation!!! ||October 12, 2018
shark1977||50||We walked through Hyde park to get from Kensington Palace to the Tube station. Hyde park is huge and looks to be a very relaxing place. I'm a bit disturbed and confused by the people sitting in the poop filled grass near the ducks, without a blanket underneath them, sitting in it and touching the poop grounds with their hands and then touching their faces. But the park is very nice. ||October 12, 2018
ibrahimengin||50||we've been there a couple of times. had too much fun with the birds and with our dog. Great place to hang. It was the first time i fell asleep in the open after some prosecco drinkin||October 12, 2018
almajida||30||I went there on 23rd July I think.. I was with my wife and the place was absolutely crowded with tourists! What I did not like about the place was the different gatherings of people who spoke about religions, politics and such. Hyde Park is a place to relax not to discuss such things. We enjoyed feeding birds and ducks the most!||October 12, 2018
cbusse2016||50||A great Park, right in the heart o Landon. To walk along or by the park is a lot to see. Sculptures, Prizess Diana Memorial fountain, many differents birds, and much more||October 11, 2018
imurphs||50||Had a great walk through Hyde Park. Very clean, well maintained, plenty of walking paths and open spaces. Had a great time. ||October 11, 2018
robbo1000||50||One of my favourite spots in Central London. You wouldn't think that you were in the middle of a large city. The swan lake is impressive; benches are plentiful around the park and nobody seems to be in a hurry.||October 11, 2018
kjmitchvacationer||50||We had a lovely walk along the Serpentine. Roses were still in bloom, and the Diana, Princess of Wales monument is a beautiful, albeit diminutive, fountain. Lovely.||October 11, 2018
Mike k||40||Only got to explore a small portion of this beautiful park. It contains the Princess Diana memorial fountain.||October 11, 2018
918elizac||50||Lovely and very big park. It is just perfect for an afternoon stroll. The vibes and scenrey are just breathtaking.||October 11, 2018
SDubs24||50||We took a stroll here after visiting some of the nearby museums (V&A, Science and Natural History museums). This is a great (and large) park for walking, biking, paddle boating, or enjoying a picnic. We stopped at a small cafe near the Albert Memorial for some coffee and a bottle of water and enjoyed some excellent people watching. The trees offer a nice contrast to the streets and buildings of London.||October 10, 2018
AndrewANZ08||50||Lovely park in the middle of London. Given the size of the park, it never feels too busy and is a great way to escape the bustle and bustle of the city.||October 10, 2018
luvtotravelCanada||50||This should be on the top of your list when in London. It’s gorgeous!! So many places to walk - whether a quick jaunt through the park or spending an afternoon to relax and enjoy and walk the circumference. All of the parks are amazing and if you have the day go from Hyde to Green to St James Park. They are easily accessible from one another.||October 10, 2018
ekarslue||50||Great park, lots of area where you can play and different small lakes with animals and birds which is quite entertaining for the kids. With a sunny day you will appreciate it even more. ||October 9, 2018
AshwinAkola||40||It was great walking through the huge park with the great weather that evening. Cool breeze. Lots of people enjoying walking eating fishing swimming and boating among the few activities. The restaurant is too good with great service.||October 9, 2018
Scott W||40||Very nice day out,feeding ducks, swans and geese. Enjoyed watching the watersports, too. My daughter enjoyed the wildlife, too.||October 9, 2018
maelennleruyet||40||We tried the english breakfast in the park, it was good. as the weather was cold and rainy, we would have appreciate a closed door!||October 9, 2018
indivam||40||I may have to revisit again. I just saw a big park. Walked to the Speaker's corner and didn't see anything noteworthy except for a number of chairs that one could rent.||October 9, 2018
Sarah K||40||From Speakers corner to the Serpentine, to all the Christmas fair and all the other activities that happen in Hyde Park. Check it out||October 9, 2018
meim979||40||The park is very beautiful . make sure to go to the pound area and there have a lot of small birds and duck swimming and walking around there. ||October 9, 2018
Natureloverstreks||50||It's an enormous park with huge space for strolling around and jogging as well. I went there most of the times whenever I was free and needed time to ponder. One's heart is at ease when one's there. I realized visiting there gets better with the company of friends and family. Wonderful park in the center of London.||October 8, 2018
vaughnthurman||50||We visited Hyde Park on two occasions on our recent trip to London. And we approached the park from the north-west corner after walking along the very crowded Oxford Street, and from the south-west after a 20 minute walk from our hotel on Cromwell Road.Hyde Park is appreciated by Londoners and visitors alike. Near to Marble Arch corner we spied empty lawn chairs and made use of.Be forewarned that these are for rent—a bloke will come over with his change machine. When we entered the park at Queen’s Gate and Kensington High St. we noticed the direction sign to Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. Why not? It is well worth the walk and along our route you walk by very lovely gardens. The Diana Memorial Fountain is lovely! Brilliant concept, wonderfully executed. A fitting tribute to the People’s Princess. There is plenty to see in this large green oasis. Or you can easily find a spot on the green, close your eyes and dream a little.||October 8, 2018
Wallywelling||50||Lovely on an autumnal sunny Sunday for a stroll amidst the joggers and bikers and those having a coffee...beautiful park in the heart of London||October 8, 2018
Richard B||40||A warm clear day so we walked Hyde Park through from Paddington to Exhibition Road. Walked around The Serpentine lake, visited the Serpentine Gallery, enjoyed the ambience.||October 8, 2018
divinetogether||50||A wonderfully huge green lung in London, sprawling lawns, hideaways, sit down , benches , tracks. Oh I was impressed ||October 8, 2018
2804gezzab||50||We enjoyed a stroll through the park on a Saturday afternoon on our way to Kensington Palace. Very pretty||October 7, 2018
Laura K||50||It was a very nice walk on a sunny afternoon. People can do boating, tennis, horse riding, or join the many joggers, walkers and cyclists enjoying the open air. It has lovely cafes and the swans are lovely. ||October 7, 2018
brown11||50||Took the opportunity to get some outdoor exercise here during a recent visit to London. It is a great choice for that.Great running paths and pretty views.It was nice to see the squirrels and hear the birds. Park is large enough that one can forget for a while that it is located in the middle of the city.||October 7, 2018
Serviceprof||40||Occupies central spot in London. Borders Kensington Palace and Buckingham. Appropriated from Westminster Abbey by Henry VIII who used it as hunting ground. Site of many major protests and free concerts. Beautifully arboretum. ||October 6, 2018
borrum||40||The wide open spaces and many pathways in Hyde Park make it a safe and attractive leisure destination for walking, cycling or horse riding. The Park has two good value informal cafe/restaurants, as well as several well located kiosks which sell sandwiches and coffees. Rowing and pedal boats are for hire on the Serpentine, and tennis courts, a putting green, and bowling greens also are open to visitors.And, on Sundays, Speakers Corner, at the Marble Arch end of the Park, provides opportunity to hear a diverse range of views on diverse topics.||October 6, 2018
Helschip||50||We’ve visited a lot of parks in London, because it’s a great way to retreat from the busy streets, renew your energy and dive back in. This is quite a lovely park to do that. It’s bigger than the average London park and it has a nice pond as well. Highly recommended.||October 6, 2018
5cruffy||50||Most tourists end up in the Eastern half with the Serpentine. Try the western half. Great views of Kensington Palace, the round pond is teeming with bird life and the avenues give long range views of buildings such as the Shard. In autumn, the trees are beautiful and there are plenty of conkers and sweet chestnuts to collect.||October 6, 2018
HopeL309||40||Hyde Park is a beautiful park in the heart of London. It's perfect for a walk and to flee from the chaos of the city during peak hours. We enjoyed the many sightings of animals and the nature itself. The memorial fountain of princess Diana, the statue of Peter Pan, the Lido are all worth a visit even if just walking along the park is sufficient for a relaxing time. It's true that the Park is very big, so be prepared to walk in comfy shoes!||October 6, 2018
amytalee||40||One of my favorite parks in London, with lots of space, perfect for sports or just walking. Sometimes there are street food stalls, it's great if you get hungry while you spend the day||October 6, 2018
AFarley1973||50||The best event I’ve ever been to, sun was shining, bands were amazing and never a queue at the bar! The food options are plentiful and unlike places like Glastonbury you can be back in a comfy bed within half an hour.||October 6, 2018
bruceywonder||50||My hotel was located within a few minutes from Hyde Park (Lancaster Gate entrance) and the gym was pretty small so I thought instead of the gym, I went for a jog around Hyde Park, which was around 20mins. I went in the morning around 8am, it was a nice weather but a bit chilly. A great way to get some fresh air and enjoy the nature. Along the way, you will see many people of all ages going for a run, walking their dogs or just simply sitting down. I didn't have a chance to enjoy the restaurants/bars/cafes there but I am very sure it must good to sit there and enjoy the nature/park.There were of course lots of swans and ducks where you can take pictures and I think theres a small section where you can row and/or swim at Hyde Park (however, you may want to Google it to verify it). I also saw some notices that you can go for early morning swim at Hyde Park but again do some research on this to verify it.I definitely will recommend Hyde Park even if its just a quick walk around. In fact, we walked from Lancaster Gate to Knightsbridge via Hyde Park (around 20~30mins). It saves you some money and save you the time to walk up/down and changing stations if taking the tube.||October 6, 2018
PatriciaB7733||40||It's a park. If you go without expecting it to be more than that, it's a beautiful park.You can sit enjoying a book or simply the view. Bring your own food to spend a morning there, watching all kinds of people passing by and riding bikes and skates.A problem we found in London is that you don't find that many rubbish bins, and this park is no exception (even though you see more than on the streets). London in general is a polluted place, probably thanks to all of the tourism.So overall I enjoyed walking around the park watching the swans and the ducks, plus the cute squirrels . Like I said, I expected it to be a cute park and it is.||October 6, 2018
smitchell1989||50||This large park is fantastic any time of the year and great to walk around or even have lunch in. There are some restaurants but its nice to bring your own and sit by the water or some trees and watch London pass by.||October 5, 2018
travelinggiant||50||What a beautiful open park to walk through, enjoy the quietness where you can't here vehicles, and relax in nature. Of interest in this park is Speakers' Corner when preachers, religious figures, and civilians can go and speak/debate/discuss most anything. People gather to listen/question/share thoughts/debate those who are speaking, and it transports you back to a time when it was common to do such a thing. A unique experience you won't soon forget.||October 5, 2018
Lunacurrie||50||Lovely park, weather was hot, just great to relax in with a pimms at the bar. The swans were beautiful and graceous, watched them for ages, lovely vintage car ice cream seller, enjoyable visit.||October 5, 2018
Ram V||40||Again, walking in Hyde Park is a feature of my regular London visits. I particularly like sitting by the Serpentine on one of the benches and watching the birds. ||October 4, 2018
johnquinterophoto||50||Hyde Park is one of my favourite places in London. A green oasis in the middle of the city, perfect for a walk no matter the season, it is always beautiful! Well maintained, safe and located in the heart of London. Even though is constantly patrolled by the Metropolitan Police, it's not advisable to visit it at night.Tip: it is huge! Take a map with you if you are not familiar with the park.||October 4, 2018
Kricket73||50||We regret we waited until the last day to visit Hyde Park. Such a beautiful serene park with a lot to do. We visited the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, walked along the water front and saw all the beautiful swans, and enjoyed a nice walk in the wooded park. Next time we go we are going to rent a paddle boat.||October 4, 2018
jwjones1||50||Free to enter, acres of greenery, plenty of seating, a lake with row boats for hire, and a lovely cafe. On a sunny day, Hyde Park is heavenly. All sorts of folks, walkers, skateboarders, roller skaters, horse back riders, and just plain strollers. Ample children's play facilities.||October 3, 2018
zatrip||40||Walking along the serpentine is very nice. The park hosted a Cristo Pyramid construction set in the water which was interesting. The museum was closed.||October 3, 2018
RizaJ_731||50||You have nice water fountains and a little lake, of course a lot of green and many different animals. The squirrels where super cute because they literally come to you and eat out of your hand. ||October 3, 2018
ToujoursLaRoute||50||Clearly one of the most famous parks in the world. Nobody will ever tell you to not walk on the grass. When I was living in London I used to do my running in the park, and it was always a fantastic experience.||October 3, 2018
lukerawlinson||50||Me and my Wife always take a lovely stroll around Hyde Park it's a place of peace and tranquility. Absolute love it ||October 3, 2018

GaryF842||50||Spent a superb couple of hours here and it was magic. Great weather helped but we were amazed by so much going on. Remote controlled yachts on Round Pond, hundreds of dogs having fun, people with personal trainers and so many visitors with such a wide variety of nationalities.Brilliant place.||October 2, 2018
ajamily||50||Nice to visit on a beautiful sunny day. The highlight was the lake with many birds flying & swimming.||October 2, 2018
Puspita H||50||Though I visited during February, and it was cold, but even during that time the park was beautiful. ||October 2, 2018
Beth G||50||We stayed nearby and found a couple of hours to walk around Hyde Park. What a treasure. It is a real slice of life park, and you'll feel right at home in London, while here. Also, wild green parakeets live here in high numbers. And, they are not so wild... these parakeets will land on your outstretched arms. Find the parakeets near Serpentine Lake and a sculpture of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. ||October 2, 2018
815irias||50||I had to cross the park from the north, marble arch to the south as we were going to the Royal Albert Hall just off Hyde park. The walk was lovely, its already early autumn, the leaves starting to change colours and the park was clean and well kept with beautiful ancient trees. It does not take more than 30 minutes and it’s a walk definitively worth taking weather permitting ||October 2, 2018
SharynG615||40||A place to stroll around and take it easy. A relaxing atmosphere to have a picnic. Escape the hustle and bustle of London, pick a sunny day and you are on a winner.||October 2, 2018
Cam P||40||On a sunny day it is really full of people. But it is a great green royal park one has to visit. They should clean more frequently on busy days though.||October 2, 2018
Lynda B||50||Lovely park area, lots to see. Great place to spend time. Loved it. I rode a horse around this area, saw lots of squirrels, birds. Fountains, statues, lots of history.||October 2, 2018
Dermott S||40||Hyde Park in the centre of London is a large park running up from Victoria in the south up to Oxford Street in the north west. At the top of the park is the world famous Marble Arch which sits near the site of where for centuries there was a scaffold for public hangings. The park has several cafes and horses are also excercised in the park which is a really lovely to see. It is the perfect place for long leisurely walks and to watch and see the wonderful sites and people of this part of London.||October 2, 2018
PScott99||50||One of my favorite parks in London. It's large with long walking trails, a lake it the middle, restaurants and chairs set up along side the lake and benches up and down the trails. Great place to rent a bike and just ride around for hours. Will plan to picnic there the next time I come!||October 2, 2018
JandJMSP||50||An area that seems to always be busy with walkers, runners, and bikers. Explore the park or simply grab a bench and enjoy the view.||October 2, 2018
Sunandfun33458||50||Beautiful, similar in size to Central Park in NYC, Buckingham (Queen lives) Castle on East side of Park, Kensington (residence for William & Harry) on West side||October 2, 2018
Mário João C||50||Very good park to take your family and kids to run, play football in the grass or just chill out in the sun/shadows.You can walk many miles and meet the Princess Diana's memorial or Albert Memorial to be near some history.You have an art exibition as well and connection to Kensington Palace.Great experience for those who seek peace! :D||October 2, 2018
saransh m||50||Hyde park is a very relaxing place. you can sit near the lake and watch the swans, sit under a tree and read a book, take long strolls or just soak the sun. few cities can boast of such a big park right in the centre.||October 2, 2018

Sachin P||40||Its a huge park with boating option.Besides you get to have the ice cream and njoy the park.There is nothing else to do.Good for family though as kids will enjoy the different kinds of birds that are present there.Ducks and swans nice one. Ducks even come over the park area outside lake||October 2, 2018
KylieM210||50||Walked through the park on our sightseeing stroll. Loved all the statues and art installations. Amazing green space in the heart of london||October 2, 2018
MarkFL-USA||50||If you go to Kensington Palace, be sure to stroll through the adjacent Hyde Park. You won't believe the size of the swans in the pond. Hyde Park's pathways also provide a good short cut between other destinations when walking.||October 2, 2018
John G||40||One good thing, about visiting London, is that you are never far from a park and they don't come bigger than this, in central London. Access to the park is not particularly easy, as it is surrounded by very busy roads. Once you have gained access, there is plenty of space to walk around in and the Serpentine is an interesting focal point. I would prefer to see more trees there, to give it a more secluded feel.||October 2, 2018
AnywhereIn4Days||50||Hyde Park is awesome. Great to walk, ride your bike, play in the fields, or feed the geese. London is a great walking city, so whenever we had the opportunity, we took the scenic route through the park!||October 1, 2018
manalkahlout||50||Very nice park.It has a very nice lake and coffee shop on the lake.There are food tracks where you can have a nice meal in the park.It is very big and full of activities.It is London ‘a landmark!||October 1, 2018
Steve L||50||This is a very large park and there are many excellent footpaths. Dogs can be offleash. There are many mature trees. This is a gorgeous park to get away from the noise and bustle of the city. ||October 1, 2018
lindseygwin||50||We were on a mission to find Peter Pan and loved our trip through Hyde Park to find him. Lovely swans in the water and just so relaxing to get away from the bustling city to this. We did see the Princess Diana fountain but it had closed by the time we got to the gate.It was getting too dark or we would have headed to the Kensington gardens as well.||October 1, 2018
hgoldman77||50||If you have nice weather don't miss spending at least an hour inside the confines of the sprawling park. They do parks well all over London, and this is the Queen of Parks. A surprise around every corner of every path, people watching galore. A lovely way to spend an hour or two. ||October 1, 2018
Keith G||40||I looked at the park a different way when visiting with people who don't like to walk or can't walk very long distances. There need to be more benches in this park, and it would be great if there was a pedi-cab option to take people through and across the park. Being from the NYC area, I often compare NYC with London and feel London is superior in many ways for my needs. However I believe that Hyde cannot hold a candle to Central Park and overall is just pretty good, so 4 stars.||October 1, 2018
AnnaH721||40||A lovely walk on a sunny Autumn day. The fountain was beautiful and extremely well done. Lots of people about relaxing in this wonderful park.||October 1, 2018
Simon W||50||You wont have a problem looking for a picnic space here. You can paddle a boat on the Serpentine, visit the Serpentine Gallery, visit the Peter Pan gardens and there is an excellent children's play area on the Queensway side of the park with great facilities. One of my favourite parks in London.||October 1, 2018
Richard S||50||Site of the 1851 Great Exhibition, Hyde park has been open to the public for over 300 years. The largest park in London contains such attractions as the Serpentine lake, where on Christmas Day hardy souls take to the waters at 9am sharp! At one end, near Marble Arch there is Speakers Corner where you may hear political debate.In the 18th century the park was popular for duels, am glad to see that this tradition has ceased! In summer you can hear live bands, in the past groups such as the Rolling Stones, REM, Pink Floyd have played. The Proms in the Park takes place in September which is another great Hyde Park occasion. There is a Winter Wonderland event in December contains themed markets, an ice rink. Underground stations Hyde Park corner, Marble Arch.||October 1, 2018
MelCaz||30||Beautiful park. The 7/7 memorial is a subtle reminder of the awful terror attacks London has endured. The Diana fountain is love,y too for the kids to cool off and play in on a warm sunny day.The Surpentine lake is just beautiful. You can take out a small rowing boat or Peddle boat and just lazily sail around the lake, although I’m not sure what the red and blue monstrosity is that has recently been built in the middle! The restaurant by the lake is really nice with lovely food.||September 30, 2018
Yorkterrier01||40||I visited here during the heatwave and whilst it was easy to walk on and not muddy, it was definitely in need of some rain.||September 30, 2018
lauramazzei||50||Hyde Park is a fabulous park. It is very big, so big that sometimes you forget to be in London. There are some bars where you can have a snack or sit for a drink. Otherwise just walk and enjoy yourself!||September 30, 2018
B4128ZFjamesc||50||It was a really nice walk, it was peaceful, sunny and you could really lose yourself, after the hustle and bustle of central London.||September 30, 2018
RossOrpington||50||My wife and I had a picnic lunch here on a Tuesday after a morning exploring the V&A museum. There were lots of seats, some shaded and others in the sun. It was great looking at the Serpentine and watching the people go by. Joggers, walkers, boaters plus pigeons, ducks and geese.It was a lovely relaxing rest. Though beware the pigeons, ducks and geese because they will come looking for crumbs!||September 30, 2018
deanio1972||50||Living in London it’s great time have these green spaces.Hyde Park is a great place to walk, have a picnic or just sit by the lakes and take in scenery. Amazing throughout the year especially summer when plenty of places to sunbathe. ||September 30, 2018
archiemh1||50||Stayed at the Hilton and the view of the Park was beautiful every morning. Walked through it to get to Knightsbridge. So much activity and the buzz was good. Beautiful and we'll manicured gardens. Takes you back to nature and away from the buzz of the city around it||September 30, 2018
StyleCoach1||50||incredible paths, well marked, manicured. Lots of benches to soak it in or rest, ponds, ducks, birds. There are a few bathrooms and small cafes within for a respite. So much bigger than I imagined. Not all paths allow bikes. Don’t miss Kensington Gardens while you’re there and the Princess Diana fountain is an incredible, safe and fun place if you have small children. Shallow running water in the park for kids to play in. ||September 29, 2018
CBow1es||50||A spacious park in the busy London. Good for a stroll, walking the dogs, picnic, running, cycling, swan watching, boating and spotting squirrels. Different feels in different seasons.||September 29, 2018

We spent most of the day wandering through them as there is plenty to see. We walked through Kensington Gardens as well, saw Kensington Palace and the sunken garden and eventually walked to Princess Diana’s memorial fountain and Buckingham Palace. Suggest you wear walking shoes and take some snacks. The restaurant adjacent to the lake is very good too and in a beautiful location.||September 29, 2018
LondonLady2005||50||Incredible absolutely amazing, just wow! i definetly recommend this as a romantic trip, family trip or a just for a gentle peddalo or swim in the amazing lake! if you get a chance to go in the summertime definetly do!!!||September 29, 2018
heather1372||50||Never been to any of London's parks before and what a pleasent surprise. Loved it. Can take a leisurely stroll around the serpentine with it abundance of wildlife ,theres pedaloes row boats and plenty of places to eat. Great to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life.||September 29, 2018
568jayf||50||Often called the 'Lungs' of London, this is yet another huge green expanse of tranquillity, beauty, history(The Peter Pan statue, The Serpentine lake, monuments, an array of birds, it's own cycle lanes, dog walkers, the list is endless. And a great cut through from Kensington to Bayswater, Park Lane, Hyde Park Corner, and Made Arch.And of course the horses galloping through. Best time to see them is from around 10am to 11am. Soldiers in gleaming uniform....||September 29, 2018
aditya k||30||Beautiful and nice place to take a walk and to be near nature. centrally located in london , you can also take a hop on and hop off to reach here easily. green and quite , very close to Westminster parliament and abbey.||September 29, 2018
JosephineS209||50||The subject says it all. A place to see a few memorials but it’s just the peace and tranquility that brings this place one of the best place, to me, to walk, to sit and to reflect. A must go every time I’m in London. ||September 28, 2018
dhgilbody||30||The title says it all. But I have to be more verbose. 100 characters, apparently. It's a city park, similar to other city parks with over-priced cafes.||September 28, 2018
BradMontero||50||Enjoy the sun, go and visit Princess Diana's memorial and rent a boat, you can also go to the Speaker's corner||September 28, 2018
RSFdowser||50||We recently stayed s short distance from Hyde Park. During our last few visits to London we stayed in the East End. I had forgotten how refreshing it is to be able to get away from the street noise. ||September 28, 2018
pauldakiwi||40||We walked the park on a spectacular blue-sky day. We enjoyed the passionate and idiosyncratic array of speakers at the Speakers' Corner - definitely worth a stop to listen, even if the argument is baffling. The broad open space was nice although the condition of the grass was poor.||September 28, 2018
Jessica T||40||Hyde Park, it s a nice vast park in the heart of London. this is the place where you can have a long walk immerse in the green with small lakes where birds are chilling and where in the land you can spot many squirrel ! On a sunny day, you will love a nice walk there||September 28, 2018
chiprian||50||Huge park in the middle of the city. Has some nice places to lay down and relax. Lots of bird too. Best place for a walk!||September 28, 2018
Journey675820||50||Hyde Park is a huge park in the centre of London. When you enter you can stay in contact with the nature, you can relax on the grass or rent a boat and sunbathing. The park is full of people and animals like squirrels and ducks. Hyde Park is a place of calm and tranquillity that I recommend to everyone.||September 27, 2018
Marta G||50||Such a big park with lots of different spots. Beautiful water features, architecture, nature etc.We did sort of get "locked in" while walking through it on a dark and rainy Saturday evening (it's barely lit) but we managed to eventually find a gate that wasn't locked already. However when we went through the park the next day - on a sunny Sunday - it was full of people enjoying the day walking with their dogs who were chasing squirrels etc.||September 27, 2018
Alex D||50||Probably one of the greatest urban parks in the country. There are lovely relaxing greens and loads of visitors love to take photos here. Hyde park is one of the royal parks and is very well kept. There is no shortage of events in the park all year round. From family and well being events to half marathons! Then there is the speakers' corner where freedom of speech is the order of the day. The park is easily accessible by public transport.This is one place you must visit once you are in London.||September 27, 2018
elmila||50||The huge park in the middle of London is very impressive. The beautiful gardens, the big lake, the many squirrels, swans and ducks invite you for hours of walking.||September 27, 2018
dhess127||40||Nice place to stroll and relax on days with nice weather. There are attractions around the park as Kensington Palace, Albert Memorial, Flower walk, Dog cemetery and Speakers Corner etc. You must allow time to walk between site plus time spent there.||September 26, 2018
SusanO1952||50||Hyde park is a perfect place to help get you away from the big city. Even though it was "busy" it didn't seem crowded. It was great to sit in the sun by the Serpentine and people/bird watch. A great place to take your kids to blow off steam. Just a lovely place to take a little time to breathe...||September 26, 2018
LeiQ6||50||The park is beautiful with different type of wild birds and inserts.  My father who is above 80's who is fascinated by these wild birds. They live in a large lake in the park and walk with you especially if you have food in hand...then the group of them will follow you...haha||September 26, 2018

joycep883||50||Hyde Park is a huge park that is excellent for a walk .there is numerous monuments and lakes throughout this park||September 25, 2018
LMExplorer||50||Locals and tourist alike love this park. Walk the Royal Walk or navigate your own way. Paddleboats are available to rent (but a little pricey in my opinion) and you can grab an ice cream for a snack along the way. There are often exhibits open with free activities. Look for signs. We visited an interactive nature exhibit with free storytime and activites for kids. ||September 25, 2018
kuczikd||40||The biggest and most famous park in London which hosts Winter Wonderland in December. I is always a pleasure to visit with my dogs and play fetch, lay down, have a picnic, an ice cream or just walk around. There is a lake in the western part with the option of hiring a boat but I find it overpriced and also that you get charged for the deck chairs hence the 4 stars.||September 25, 2018
Brett N||50||We have been to London several times and we always stay within close proximity to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.What a beautiful place to go for a long walk under the trees, ride a bike, watch the squirrels scampering from tree to tree.This is truly a gem of London and so well maintained.||September 24, 2018
Turtle5954||40||the lungs of london... give park right in the middle... an oasis of calm and green amongst the frenetic daily life of the city. always love coming here... walk..bike... whatever. just enjoy ||September 24, 2018
allancamer0n||40||If you have a couple of hours to spare take a walk in Hyde Park. There is still plenty of people enjoying the park, but it is a break from the bustle of the city without having to travel far. We enjoyed the wildlife (we’ll not that wild really), had breakfast at the cafe in the middle of the park (which gets a tick), checked out Kensington Palace and gardens. Just a great way to spend a morning chilling out||September 24, 2018
U281BLlees||40||Beautiful park in the city. It is so lovely just to walk about an relaxed. My favourite is seeking out the Peter Pan statue ||September 24, 2018
PennyDM||30||Although it is a huge park, it is not the best park you can find in the winter. But if you are going from Marble Arch to Harrods, you can go inside the park for a short walk.||September 24, 2018
Leverance||50||A beautiful Park anytime of the year. A true taste of London. Lovely to see the horses and the walkways are gorgeous.||September 24, 2018
JenniferL1106||50||A lovely park to wander through on a hot summers day, when we were there there was part of the lake sectioned off so that you could swim in it, we weren't that brave.Lots of children paddling in the Diana Memorial fountain near the lake.||September 24, 2018
Rina T||40||Beautiful but somewhat surprised that we had to pay for deck chair use. (They were already out on the lawns) Maybe it’s a London thing :)||September 24, 2018

Ron R||30||The park was showing signs of the UK heat wave & drought, It was parched and brown. The garden was rather small and we had missed the peak bloom. ||September 23, 2018
Saffron263||40||Love this park. So many places that are a joy to see. From the planting to the wildlife. Also good d views of some of l9ndinds historic buildings. ||September 23, 2018
resviolist||50||If your hotel isn't quite near Hyde Park it's definitely not something you need to take an extra trip out for, but if you're within walking distance or find yourself walking through it to get somewhere, it's a wonderful place to walk around and chill and have a picnic or a coffee at one of the cafés around the park. You can rent boats to take out on the lake there, a mid-price range activity. Great relaxation spot but not a tourist attraction.||September 23, 2018
drsame77||50||This park is amazing , great for walking, running .. cycling .. it is a great natural place in the middle of the city, with a charming centrally located lake, where u can stop in the coffee shop their for coffee or tea. It is the largest green area in London, strongly recommended to visit it.||September 23, 2018
Bluebrooke88||50||I loved this park and the good vibe it had...but what is that monstrosity that is in the lake??? No one I asked could tell me what it was??? ||September 23, 2018
Ash2212||40||We were here whilst watching a sporting event, and despite the rain the kids loved the space and the playground, and were just amazed by the sculpture in the Serpantine. Great space to take a rest from the hustle and bustle of the city||September 23, 2018
kamodra||50||I do not need to say anything about this place. This is really a place to be once you are in London. You can plan part of each day to sit or walk in a part of this park. The best way to enjoy is to grap your breakfast or brunch and have it in one of this Parks corners; either close to the lake where you share with seaguls and Geese or on a bench of one of its beautiful flower gardens and share with pegions. ||September 23, 2018
nicole s||40||Every time we come to London we buy a few sandwiches and drinks and come for a peaceful hour to Hyde park to sit and watch people.||September 22, 2018
Katarína C||50||Hyde park is nice place to picnic or sport. We had just walking through where we saw a lot pigeons, ducks and swans. Also parrots around Rose Garden!!!! Great experience.||September 22, 2018
Naomi E||50||So much space, and serenity! The Princess Di playground is right on the edge, but worth walking to - both because the playground is mammoth and delightful, and because the walk there takes you down broad paths, among towering trees, and with beautiful ponds here and there.||September 22, 2018
jess_smithsf||50||I love coming here, walking along the pond, watching the swan and people... it is very peaceful here, and a welcome break from the busy citylife||September 22, 2018
GLC314||30||This park was established by Henry VIII in 1536 when he took the land from Westminster Abbey and used it as his personal hunting ground. It opened to the public in 1637 and quickly became popular, particularly May Day parades. Mostly used today as parkland for relaxing and exercise and the occasional concert. ||September 21, 2018
LouHShrewsbury_MA||50||this park is quite large which meant a lot of walking. We were On a quest to find the Princess Diana Memorial and we walked forever to find it. The location of the memorial is not very well marked.||September 21, 2018
Gina A||50||Be ready to walk...walk...walk. We started from Marble Arch, walked to the Serpentine, ran into friends at Princess Diana's Memorial Fountain and ended up in Kensington Garden's Round Pound before crossing over to our hotel in Bayswater. But what a big, beautiful and interesting park! Lots of romantic park benches and folding chairs to rest on. Monuments, sculptures, cafés, and even rest rooms dotted the park which makes it enjoyable for all.||September 21, 2018
chrissY8464EG||50||I explored Hyde Park and greatly enjoyed it. It's a pretty lively park with people hanging out. There's also food there if you're interested in eating. My favorite part was ALL OF THE DOGS! So great! Definitely recommend!||September 21, 2018
radtechtim2003||50||Went to Hyde park park primarily to see the Princess Diana memorial. We also enjoyed seeing Kensington Palace. Lots of walking but a beautiful park. ||September 21, 2018
Bill C||50||A large somewhat open park just north of Buckingham Palace and just south of Paddington Station. Lots of energetic joggers, cyclists and strollers in this park which is well used by locals and tourists alike. We were in London for the first time for an eight day visit and thoroughly enjoyed our strolls through the park and the interesting sites, monuments and wildlife throughout. The green parrots that were feeding from peoples hands were a treat and a surprise to see. The lakeside cafe prepared two great mochas for us which we enjoyed with a piece of delicious cake on the lakeside patio. We would definitely visit this park again. ||September 21, 2018
Micky270566||40||Just the sole visit and it ticked all the boxes. I was surprised how big it was, you can litterly walk and walk for miles. Plenty to observe, lake, trees, flowers etc. Very nice.||September 21, 2018
Kay_Aujla||40||Sometimes whilst visiting these park, you forget youre in London. Time stops yet families and lovers walk by, in their own worlds.||September 21, 2018
Sk L||50||we walked to nearly every corner of this park, just enjoy the variety of trees and garden flowers. sufficient eateries in the park.Only disadvantage is the lack of public toilets around the park.||September 21, 2018
Ady315||50||Hyde park is one of the larger if not largest park in Central London.Had something for everyone with a cafe, open air pool, Italian fountains, playgrounds etc.There are also monuments in different parts of the park if you have the time would recommend walking around the park or cycling.||September 20, 2018
Camper400021||30||I don’t find this park especially charming, I much prefer St James park, which I think is much nicer.||September 20, 2018
Abdur L||50||The Princess Diana Memorial walk is very calming and offers a number of fauna and flora. Perfect for a late afternoon stroll and the lake at Hyde Park is picturesque at Sunset||September 20, 2018
ptrabant||40||So its really in the centre surrounded by public transport so easy to get from toad from and just at edge of shopping centre so easy to take a break and have lunch here in the summer . Lots of people use it so its hardly a secret and there is traffic noise being in the centre . safe during day and reasonably safe later on.||September 20, 2018
Roger C||50||What a park! I love how the place is so verdant right in the middle of town. I jogged the circuit every morning along with scores of others. I did not stop at any of the attractions, but there are many to choose from.I felt completely safe even though it was quite early in the morning, ||September 20, 2018

Isabell A||50||Love it for picknic at the weekend. There is plenty to see and do. Usually we spend almost whole day||September 19, 2018
panda2373||50||Hyde park is my favorite place in London. Probably because it has a bit of everything: history, beautiful gardens, nearby Kensington palace and gardens, princess diana memorial fountain and the gorgeous Prince Albert memorial statue.The round pond, filled with ducks and beautiful white swans, is a place where you can sit and linger for a while, taking in the gorgeous surrounds. Hyde Park is the place to do lots of people watching, hire a bike, or take a leisurely stroll along one of the trails. When compared with other city parks around the world, such as central park in New York, this one definitely comes out on top. It is so clean and the government pays workers to maintain it. If you're lucky you'll see a squirrel or two. Definitely a must see, and if you can, plan to linger.||September 19, 2018
Laughing T||50||I have gone so many times, it never fails to make me happy. This place is pure gold. I would go there around 5 pm and stay until the park closes. Bring a picnic, invite friends, have a great time.||September 19, 2018
eddiebrse||50||Convenient park for a jogging, walking or for just relaxing after a walk around the city. There’s a lake with different types of birds, very nice for the kids.||September 19, 2018
Susan R||40||We wandered around the park and it was lovely, make sure to get to the water area, where there's a large art installation and great people watching. ||September 19, 2018
Michyv00||50||Walked all around the park, had lunch and thoroughly enjoyed my visit. So close to the city, something for everyone to see and do, historical sites, palaces, squirrels and playgrounds. You can even take a boat on the serpentine! After my visit I walked to marble arch and did some shopping on Oxford St. Highly recommended for everyone young and old! What a great spot to have in the city! ||September 19, 2018
BestRegardsFromFar||40||Having our flat in Notting Hill for the weekend and needing to head to town, we've crossed Hyde Park several times. Many paths are for pedestrians only and allow a pleasant stroll without the need to look out for bikers, perfect with children! There are specific cycle lanes that allow you to cross the park. We did that with the Santander bike system which worked perfectly well. The Diana Memorial and Kensington Gardens are the most interesting as the rest of Hyde Park is large and very similar.||September 19, 2018
Anastasiyka||40||It is huge park where you probably need a map to navigate. The pond is also huge and in summer time you can apparently enjoy swimmimg in the lido (haven't try it). ||September 18, 2018
Debra S||50||What a great place to have an event like the Proms in the Park. 40,000 people all singing, waving flags and just being happy. Despite the sheer number of people, we never found we had to queue for the loos, ice cream or drinks. We were lucky to find a great spot to set ourselves up. We didn't have chairs so just put our picnic blanket on the grass and sat down to enjoy a most enjoyable evening. The sound quality was absolutely fine, didn't have a problem hearing any of the excellent artists performing. We weren't too near the front but could still see the stage well, and for close ups we watched the big screen. The finale was great both singing and fireworks and getting out at the end was a lot easier than we expected it to be. All in all a great evening in a great place. The only thing that spoiled it was the amount of rubbish people left behind, we were given a recycling bag when we got there and there were plenty of refuse bins so it was a shame that some people didn't bother to use them.||September 18, 2018
Y2622PYcraigm||50||A lovely peaceful oasis in a bustling city. Had everything you'd expect from a park, including some friendly squirrels and Macaws (at least that's what i think they were) take some monkey nuts with you and with a little patience , they'll be eating out of your hand! the rest of the park is nice too with a house belonging to Liz at one end.||September 18, 2018
mrsmuddled||40||We went into and through Hyde park on a number of occasions. There wasn't much to see that you couldn['t see in any park in North America. It was mostly a path to get to other things.||September 18, 2018
kiwichick2012||50||Worth a walk through this beautiful park. Visit the pond to see the birds too. There are some refreshment stops here too. ||September 18, 2018
Sarah S||30||This was the 6th time we have been to the Proms on the Park. We presumed there would be the usual live link up for the finale - we were very disappointed that this was not the case and we have already decided that we will not be going next year. There seemed to be a lot more people there this year, possibly swelled by 8000 rock choir members plus their friends and family - it was much more difficult to find a piece of grass to sit on, use the loos, buy drinks etc. Also some very selfish people at the front had tied themselves into large areas with their bunting/seats etc - the use of chairs shouldn't be allowed right at the front. The sound quality was not brilliant - not sure whether this says more about the singers than the technology! Josh Groban absolutely stole the show - I will save the £50.00 ticket fee next year and put it towards going to one of his concerts instead!||September 18, 2018
Mohamed_Yateem||50||the most lovely and enjoyable place in London, whatever that you want to do, you can do it here. the kids love it, me and my wife enjoy walking and setting there having peace of mind. I really can't say much it won't be enough. don't read about Hude Park go and enjoy it||September 17, 2018
Pkoch||40||We took a long walk through Hyde Park during our last visit.The weather was nice and it was a lovely Sunday morning.It is much used for dog owners to take thier fourlegged friends for a walk, most of them not on a leash.Jogging, bycycling , walking , you name it they are here, just as us.It is a beautiful park and we were amazed to see so many parrots flying around and we also came across some very freindly squirrels that were not afraid of us.Could tell that they were used to be fed by people passing by.A lovely park and worth a visit.||September 17, 2018

osulaw75||50||To me, there is never a bad day in Hyde Park. When in London, can't imagine going there a few times. In fact, I've always stayed a hotel across the street to make that part of my London trips. There is just something about the beautiful flowers and grounds that are such a respite from the bustling city just outside the entry to the park. There was a real issue one day when the toilet facilities were not operating at the Serpentine restaurant and there was a few hours wait for a plumber to repair. They did shut off beer sales, but the rest of the facility kept serving food and drinks as if nothing was wrong. I watched countless customers looking anguished at the closed facilities and even I had to walk to the closest alternative and pay 20 pence for the right to use the facilities! All in all, just a small inconvenience compared to the overall beauty of this place. Would highly recommend a stroll as a stress reducer.||September 16, 2018
363stephenp||50||Always a lovely time when visiting the park Long walk to enjoy the wildlife in the parkClean and tidy throughout the park||September 16, 2018
FelixB1977||50||Walked there a little bit and it definitelycalmed me down from the stressful atmosphere in the city. The animals are not scared at all so you can be lucky and see squirrels for example from a short distance. Great for a run as well.||September 16, 2018
bellarussell||50||This is my local park and also my favourite. It is absolutely stunning and a great place to walk your dog with friends or take your family. The pond is beautiful and great to walk around. Beautiful no matter what the weather is! ||September 16, 2018

BillyVaughan||30||Came here a while back with the other half after thinking it would be nice to go into London for the day. It’s quite an expensive places but if you are going just to enjoy the park itself and maybe have a chilled day then this is defiantly for you. ||September 16, 2018

Peggy R||40||What a marvelous place for a walk! Planted areas, fountains, statuary-very calming. Also there is a lake and restaurant area for refreshments and light lunch,choices. ||September 16, 2018
MMBMNY||20||A fine enough park, but rather overrated. The food concessions are limited and the way-finding signs are poor. In many places along the walkways, there is little shade. You have to pay for most of the only seating in the park, and do so based on how long you sit there. Unless you want to see or do something specific in the park (e.g., the Albert Memorial, rent a boat), or it's a place you can traverse right on your way to someplace else you want to go, it's entirely skip-able (especially if you have a big park, like NYC's Central Park, back home and the whole big-scenic-park concept isn't novel to you).||September 15, 2018
Joolay||50||Made the effort to get to Hyde Park in particular to see the Diana Memorial. But I encouraged my sister to ride a bike and we both set off to see what we could of the park. Its beautiful and you would not thing London is so close except for all the people. It was great to see so many (many many people) enjoying the sunny day. We managed to avoid running over anyone thank goodness but the park it beautiful and I can understand why everyone is out and about enjoying this beautiful place. Totally recommend a visit.||September 15, 2018
weloveaz||50||Came here mainly to see the Princess Diana memorial, but the park is well worth a visit for other reasons. Beautiful gardens, places to grab a bite and also there are boats to be rented. All in all a great place to pass a few hours||September 15, 2018
Anjali S||50||Hyde Park has multiple entrances so please plan your day from where you want to start.You can easily pack a sandwich and do a nice picnic, go on the serpentine lake for boating, visit Diana Memorial, see the locals play football or Cricket.The park offers all facility like children's play area, dedicated biking route, food stalls.||September 15, 2018
paulaemilyneill||50||The park is very large! We strolled across a few times. The flower gardens are quite pretty and nice big benches to sit on. Inside there are many squirrels. There are places to have very tasty ice cream and purchase coffee or soda pop. The ponds are pretty and the park is well maintained. ||September 14, 2018

Thought there’d be more of a sing a long and music from the Royal Albert Hall. Food looked over priced (we took a huge picnic!). Beer ok price but wine a bit dear but again we’d taken our own drinks and had been searched on entry, others didn’t seem to have their bags looked at properly as they’d taken in far more than the ‘allowed’ amount per person. Still a good day out because we made it so.||September 14, 2018
Calypsokimmy||50||The park itself was very impressive! It was Soooo big and the nature and green is great ! There are also toilet, what was perfect ! Saw wild squirrels. Very romantic place ! ||September 14, 2018
Sandie C||50||Amazing concert. Thoroughly enjoyed. Very well organised and plenty of food and drink outlets. Toilets good too.||September 14, 2018
james797||50||Brilliant day yet again, good weather and atmosphere. Safe place for all the family. Excellent day out to watch a selection of bands- Lenny Kravitz, Rita Ora, Kylie and the Manic Streat Preachers to name a few.||September 13, 2018
shernellt||50||As I’m an outdoor and nature person, naturally I’d be interested in this park. It’s a huge park so there’s lots of space, green grass, trees, plants and flowers. There’s no shortage of quiet spots to read, nap, chat with friends, jog, cycle, etc. There are also toilets around, some are free and some you have to pay to enter (£0.20 p). There are some benches (free to sit) and also chairs which you have to rent per hour (£1.80). But sitting or laying on the grass is just fine, or you can bring your own picnic mat. There are some shops/restaurants selling food if you need a bite. Bikes are also available to rent from the park. The Underground and some bus stops are nearby.||September 13, 2018
Nicky G||50||I have wanted to go to the Proms in the Park for several years, when it co-insided with my birthday I felt it was time to actually go. It was really well organised, great atmosphere, can't wait to go again||September 13, 2018
Victoria S||50||I got there first thing when it opens at 10am, and it was quiet and peaceful. A good way to start the day before venturing out for a day of sightseeing.||September 13, 2018
Jill60859||50||We rode through the park on the Fat Tires tour and we also walked through the park. It was beautiful and very safe. ||September 13, 2018
balichick47||50||Just loved Hyde Park. So lovely and spacious, green and peaceful. Loved my walks here while staying in Mayfair. Great cafe too. Oh and a cold beer further along!||September 12, 2018
John B||50||This very large space, if you include Kensington Gardens and the Serpentine, is always popular particularly in fine summer weather.There are many memorials (Albert, Diana Princess of Wales, Holocaust, Norwegian War, 7/7) and statues.Rather short on places to eat and drink. Toilets at the northern end near Lancaster Gate tube.||September 12, 2018
Colin P||50||We were there for the proms in the park on 8th Sept and again on 9th by the Serptine you would not believe you are in the middle of London.||September 12, 2018
JR1707||40||we have a good walk around look around and go kensington park too which is huge park to walk but is a very good walk||September 12, 2018
janicen502||50||This was one of my favorite things in London. We rode bikes for hours and enjoyed outside cafes. It’s a really nice park. ||September 12, 2018
valsirob||40||On your way to Buckingham Palace you definitely should pass/cross the Hyde Park and rest for a moment. Sit on the grass, be careful if you want to sit to many chairs put in a certain disorder all across the par on the grass, since they are not free (if I look well £1,80/hour). If you are with kids, take some old bread with you and they will enjoy giving it to the pigeons and ducks...||September 12, 2018
Anfield1970||40||Went out for a pcinic wit h the family. Definitely worth going to especially if you take advantage of the boating or cycling.||September 11, 2018

YamYam804||50||For my visit there was a carnival set up and it was really cool to walk around we took a tour bus and they explained why Hyde Park exist and how amazing in large it is. ||September 11, 2018
Jan P||50||The gardens give you pleasure and time to sit and rest in London, the roses OMG amazing so pleaceful for such a busy city||September 11, 2018
Sheila R||50||The whole event by far exceeded my expectations . Having been to many open air concerts, over the years, this one has to have been one of the best. Disregarding the actual concert, the event was brilliantly organised. Forty thousand people inside the park and mo queues. Bars and food outlets were plentiful, and queue free. The biggest and best surprise we’re the toilets, which unlike the usual stinking chemical type, were clean, smell free and plentiful. No waiting!Well done to the organisers for providing such a comfortable, clean environment.||September 11, 2018
ALNMTRAVEL9200||40||This park is a large beautiful London staple. It reminded us so much of Central Park in NY. We walked to Kennsington Palace taking the route thru the park and were glad we did. The ponds, the vibe, and the relaxing atmosphere made this a very great little excursion on the way to Kennsington.||September 11, 2018
vickybE6659DT||10||We have been to Hyde park 8 times and this was the poorest. Why would we travel from the very north west of England (considering the cost of travel tickets and hotel) to what is PROMS in Hyde Park not to be linked at the end to Royal Albert Hall that is the whole point of going to the Saturday concert. The rock choir were very good and the tenor excellent but could have sung one or two more and Jess Gilliam our local girl played wonderfully but only one tune. We went to see Bat out of Hell at the theatre and it was one of the best shows we've seen but no one would have guessed that from the small piece on the PROMS. The BBC should be ashamed.||September 11, 2018
cristinab552||40||Last morning of our London stay was dedicated to a nice and long walk in the park. It's really big and quiet and very much relaxing to take a break from noise, traffic and crowd. There were a lot of swans and ducks, and also 2 squirrels looking for food. One reached our shoes and eat a chestnut from our hands, it was so exciting! There is a possibility to rend a small boat and raw on the lake.||September 11, 2018
neil m||50||Well organised BBC. Lenny Kravitz, on first, got the crowd in the right mood. All the acts put in a good shift and kept us entertained throughout the day. Celebrated 44 years married and our first festival on the same weekend. Would definately come back again,hopefully Lenny Kravitz will too!!.||September 10, 2018
Baja001||50||Hyde Park is a great place to enjoy a rest from the hustle & bustle of the Knightsbridge area of London. Grab a snack or lunch & go for a walk, have a picnic, feed the birds or just relax. Check out the rose garden while there.||September 10, 2018
bryans983||30||A mixed bag. Sound was poor at times. We could not hear what Gladys night was saying between songs and some of the early acts seemed muted. Josh Groban was the star by a country mile but we only got 4 songs. So much wasted time with filling and mediocre acts. Matt Goss was awful, i had hoped he would do some of his swing stuff but he did his old bross stuff which is still awful and destroyed Hotel California. It would better to have a smaller bill and give them more time. I doubt i would go again, put the money to one good artist's gig instead. All that last night nationalistic stuff should be consigned to history, we left to avoid it. Thankfully rock choir, Gladys knight and the outstanding Josh Groban(and the resulting smile on my wife's face) made it worth the entrance fee.||September 10, 2018
irinactn||50||This is the perfect spot for relaxing, walking and taking photos. So reserve a whole day for this activity, you will surely love it. The park is huge, so make sure you don't run around trying to see all of it. Just wander around, beautiful things are right around the corner!||September 10, 2018
CastleTaylor69||50||Highlights - Gladys Knight, Josh Groban, Joseph Calleja, JessGillam, BBC concert Orchestra. All of these performances were fantastic. We got there for the beginning at 5PM but doors open at 3PM so already most people were sitting. Next year would be good to have more screens further back as there was limited views. ||September 10, 2018
gjw5050||20||We were eagerly looking forward to our third visit but I can only express disappointment at the 2018 effort. It was very disjointed, there was far too much talk and interviews. Micheal Ball seemed stretched to fill in. The performers were reasonable but they need to spend more time on the performers and less time telling us what performers were coming up or time the event organizer had to start planning etc. Disappointing also that there was no direct link to the Albert Hall for the finale.||September 10, 2018
O4057XPshirleyl||40||Nice to see a different line up schedule this year putting Craig Charles in a better slot on the programme. Favourites were Boyzone and Band of Love. As for Lenny Kravitz - superb!!Did not think I would like Kylie- oh wow!Another great festival BBC Radio 2 ||September 10, 2018
KeithGL||30||I want to start by saying that we really enjoyed the acts (the Rock Choir flashmob was great), but we were left underwhelmed this year.Getting into the park was spoilt by the heavy-handed security who seem to think they were some kind of law enforcement. They were slow, inefficient and made their own rules about items that were/were not allowed (apparently they don't abide by the printed terms/conditions), to the point that we nearly walked away.I wish the Bat out of Hell cast had done more, and Lisa Stansfield had done less, there was such a long wait for her to come on that it felt like she was being a diva - and I'm sure that wasn't the case.Gladys Knight was outstanding, well worth waiting for.It was disappointing that we didn't link with Albert Hall and the other parks this year, I'm sure we were supposed to, but the BBC took that Proms pages down during the event so we couldn't check.And the toilets ..... a 20 minute queue at one toilet, or a lake of liquid at another one, while the recorded voice is telling us about the wonderful new toilet facilities? That's one act that needs cleaning up.Will we go again - yes probably||September 10, 2018
Jo T||20||What a let down! I had been to 2 previous ones, but this one was badly choreographed with some 2nd rate performances! The Rock Choir start was brilliant as was Josh Grogan and 'Bat out of Hell', but the others left a lot to be desired. Then to add insult to injury no link with the Albert Hall or other Proms in the Park - Why, oh Why BBC?||September 10, 2018
JanBarnes2014||50||First time visit thanks to my Rock Choir membership. Arrival just takes your breath away. So well organised and the people helping, catering, welcoming all excellent. Superb variety of music which was so uplifting. The flash bomb by the Rock Choir (I think that’s the right phrase) was very moving and so the scene was set for total enjoyment. Would love to have stayed till the end but train times had to be followed. Will stay over next time. Confirmed that people LOVE to sing. Thank you so much Jan B||September 9, 2018
Amanda R||50||Beautiful park to sit and watch the world go by. The carousel is worth a ride even for big kids but the Princes Diana playground is definitely for the little ones. My 11 yr olds got bored pretty quickly.||September 9, 2018
PoleSofie||50||I live so close to Hyde Park, I come here regularly. It is family friendly, amazing in summer for a pedallo trip across the lake and chilling.||September 9, 2018
Waiterdave||40||Following brunch at Kensington Palace we had a stroll round Hyde Park. What a treat it was. The late summer sun was shining , lots of people milling around, children playing, sounds of laughter - you could be miles away from the noise of the city - a real gem! ||September 9, 2018
nicola m||20||Third time - this year very disappointing . Some of the acts didn’t reach the audience far too much filling - felt like more talking then performing - didn’t link up with the Albert Hall - didn’t seem to be an atmosphere this year . Sadly won’t be going next year||September 9, 2018
25wendy||10||What a disappointing evening..This was my 4th visit to this event and I definetly won't be there next year..Michael Ball spent a lot of time "filling in".There is no way one could describe this event as the party in the park that we have come to enjoy.Some of the music was very sad and not in the least bit rousing or music to lift you or to dance to.I failed to see why 25 minutes should be given over to the history of the event and interviews to those involved.It was supposed to be a concert.Finally I loved the moment when the whole thing came together with being linked to the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall.Why oh why did that not happen.What a shame .we spent so much money on this event and our overnight stay in London..Very Very disappointed.||September 9, 2018
L87SGmichaelr||50||If one reviews the Crime Maps, it is clear that the main part of the park is "safe" where just north of the lake there are lots of drug arrests and just outside the park at the main entrances, there are robberies/assaults. So, although it is a beautiful park, be careful displaying expensive electronics. It may be that there are people watching you in the park in order to rob you upon your exit. That being said, I did not see one instance or anything remotely so, that was threatening. I jogged every day, had some electronics, and deliberately perused the streets between my hotel and the park. It seemed absolutely safe but then again, I am not the ideal target.||September 9, 2018
Crystal206||10||This is the first time we've been to the Proms in the Park. It was so disappointing, There was no "Proms" atmosphere until the last 20 minutes by which time I think most people had lost interest. Too many gaps which could have been filled with a singalong rather than Michael Ball wandering about with the microphone hoping to find someone interesting to talk to. The line up was totally wrong for Proms in the Park, apart from Rock Choir which were the stars of the night.||September 9, 2018
PeterinUK||10||Having attended a number of open air prom events, we expected great things of this event in London. On the positive side,the event was well organised. The picnic hampers were good, and there was lots of food and drink available for purchase.On the negative side, the acts were awful. Only Josh Groban and Rock Choir did anything to lift the mood. The other acts were awful, particularly Gladys Knight. We will not waste our time and money attending this event again.||September 9, 2018
Mzlady09||50||We spent some time here when visiting Kensington Palace. Great place for an early morning stroll and lots of dogs in the afternoon. Much larger than I anticipated and a lovely way to spend a leisurely day. ||September 9, 2018
DaveWomble||40||It would be unreasonable to mark the park for the quality of the Prom show so my marks reflect Hyde Park itself and it’s facilities. I’ve visited often over the years, from when when was very young and only a few weeks ago to meet friends - love the park itself. It really is an oasis in central London but is huge and you can escape the traffic although it’s very well used. There is lots of space to run around, play games and interesting sculptures and statues. It’s great to see Earthcaches but sadly there are no physical caches which is a great shame - I’ve never understood why the park authorities won’t allow geocaches (citing a security risk) when they are everywhere else. Are they expecting exploding film canisters will damage their trees?Anyway, a star knocked off for bad management decisions but otherwise a strong performance. For Prom in the Park, the Hyde Park facilities worked well but the BBC failed badly. Little content, lots of filling and the only good bits were Rock Choir and the last bits of the last night such as Jerusalem. Won’t be going again. ||September 9, 2018
fardellion||40||As an architecture lecturer I often visit the serpentine galleries, both located within the grounds of Hyde park. During the summer months the serpentine pavilion is on and this year a new addition has been installed on the lake. It great to see public architecture being installed in places like this and adds another reason to visit as well as the glorious views and surroundings.||September 9, 2018
RichardM1959||30||I was really looking forward to this, having seen the event on TV over the last few years, but it didn't live up to expectations! Some of the performers did absolutely nothing to get the audience going and it all went on for too long. Michael Ball, who was good, had to fill in far too much. Whilst I wasn't expecting a seven hour long singalong, more should have been done to create a better atmosphere. The finale was OK but not as good as I had hoped for. Quality not quantity is the phrase that comes to mind!||September 9, 2018
42GeorgieB||20||I’ve been to Proms a few times, this programme was the worst! Loads of gaps filled with rubbish chatter, the music just wasn’t as good. Normally there’s loads of music that literally has people dancing in the aisles, and that just didn’t happen yesterday. The bat out of Hell cast did 1 song, barely worth turning up for! And it wasn’t even paradise by the dashboard lights. Really disappointed BBC! I hope there’s a better show next year! If not, I won’t be going again. ||September 9, 2018
rgm1954||40||Caught the tube to look at Harrods and then walked back to heart of the city throught the park. It was very dry and hot but enjoyable walk through the park. Not easy to find water but found a pub in Oxford Street to cool off.||September 9, 2018
kevint82||10||Travelled a long way for what I hoped would be a great experience. All I can say is that other than a couple of excellent performers, it was as flat as a pancake. Organisers really ought to review format. Not enough rousing music, too much talking and ego tripping. The crowd were lost after the first excellent Rock Choir, only got them back for the last bit of the proms. Waste of time and money.||September 9, 2018
BogEye666||10||I have been for 10 years and was very disappointed. Where was the classic music? Where was the atmosphere? Only three arias from the tenor, the rest of the music being mediocre ‘for the masses’ pop type music. No link to to the Albert Hall either for Pomp and Circumstance etc. either. Far too many gaps in the programme leaving Michael Ball having to fill with inane chatter.Definitely won’t be coming back, it’s completely dumbed down.||September 8, 2018
Bernie L||40||Try walking through the park when you travel in to London instead of simply hopping on the tube! There is plenty to see and do with acres of park to explore.Great place for a picnic, family get together or simply to stroll around and soak up the atmosphere. Joggers abound, horses occasionally gallop by. It’s just a pleasant place to visit.||September 8, 2018
GoAlong2||50||This large park offers a respite from the busy streets of London. With paths, ponds, paddleboats, playgrounds, and picnic areas, there are plenty of ways to relax.||September 8, 2018

AndreLErasmus||40||New York might have Central Park but London's Hyde Park is, in my opinion, better, It even has royalty! Tucked away at one end is Kensington Palace where folk like Harry and Meghan, Will and Kate, among others, live.Besides that, there are fountains, lakes, swimming areas, the Princess Diana moving water monument, lakes, vast lawns, trees, eateries and much much more.It is a worthwhile day's outing that will regenerate those tired city souls. Great for adults and kids. There's a cool playpark for the younger ones, too!||September 5, 2018
Rachenda R||50||Only viewed part of Hyde Park, but I enjoyed a peaceful moment on the bench & simply enjoying the perfect atmosphere. ||September 5, 2018
stephaniegU8477LH||50||Absolutely MUST take a stroll or run here, picnic with family or sit and read or enjoy the surroundings. A gem right in the heart of the city. I found it to be clean and safe at various times of day on my own. You can do an extended loop and end up at Buckingham Palace. Wear comfortable walking shoes. The gardens are lovely. ||September 5, 2018
ABohemianGirl||50||My husband and I were in London for 10 days. We enjoyed both Hyde Park and Regents Park. Very peaceful. I wish we would have made it on Sunday in hopes of someone speaking on Speakers Corner. Princess Diana's memorial fountain should have been more grand. She deserved more. The rose garden is beautiful. The summer art project was a bit bazaar. Kept thinking it was being built, but apparently that was it!||September 5, 2018

lyndah59||50||lived only 20 mins train ride from London all my life but never really explored Hyde Park. Spent a great day here - pedaloes, walking through the gardens, watching the skaters, ice cream by the lake, Diana's fountains to cool down! Love it! Peaceful park yet right in the centre of London! Cant wait to visit again!||September 3, 2018
DeIisles||50||Hyde Park is absolutely beautiful with many ways to either cut through or to stroll along the serpentine. You can also rent a boat on the serpentine. Really impressed that there are lounge chairs put out in the summer months for the public to enjoy. Carry some food to feed the ducks!||September 3, 2018

gwrench666||50||If you don't know - the artist Christo has his latest work on view in the serpentine in Hyde Park. its fantastic as ever and free and you don't have to like art to be interested in it - and its huge - about the size of 2 mansion houses and in the middle of the serpentine .||September 2, 2018

38clayg||50||Hyde Park is one of the better green spaces I’ve ever been to. There’s something there for everybody. From running paths to tanning spots to picnic spots, it’s a great place for activities. It’s about 6 miles around the perimeter, and I enjoyed running here. It’s also relatively clean.||September 2, 2018
Judycrook||50||My friend and I took a spontaneous trip into London for a spot of shopping in Oxford Street then decided to treat ourselves to some food for a mini picnic from M and S. we took the food over to the serpentine and had such a nice couple of hours just sitting on the grass watching the world go by. Groups of Families and friends enjoying precious time together. Storms guarding their spots searching for fish. Just a lovely relaxing time to chill ||September 2, 2018
dale160||40||The park has lots to offer including the well-known areas such as Speakers' Corner. We enjoyed looking at and learning about the various sculptures around the park. This is a super place for younger children and they would especially enjoy the water feature of Princes Diana's memorial on a hot day. Deck chairs are available for hire.||September 2, 2018

Isabella P||50||It is not possible to be in London without going to Hyde Park: the wonderful Mastaba by Christo cannot be avoided. I suggest you to go to Queensway: just cross the road and you're at Kensington Gardens, that deserve themselves to be seen; keep on walking and, on your left, you can visit the exposition, free and detailed, just to have a deeper idea of the Mastaba itself. Go straight on, cross the road and from the bridge it'll appear in all its splendor. Really amazing: Christo will surprise once again.||September 1, 2018
d0ris24||50||Amazed at how huge Hyde Park is, lots to do and see. Boating lake. Refreshments. Facilities. Deck chairs. Wildlife. A good few hours spent strolling around the park||August 31, 2018

Then enjoyed the evening chatting, drinking water and snacking in a relaxed state on the vast greens at this huge park. I took my shoes off and ran around safe in the knowledge I would not get hurt. The ground is clean. There is no glass, rocks, litter to step or dog s*** to fall on. Perfect day out in a beautiful setting.||August 31, 2018

Em H||40||We had a great stroll around the park, It was a boiling hot day in the middle of the heat wave, we stopped for drinks by the water which had a fab view, We also saw the Princess Diana memorial fountain, a section was broken and under construction but there were children playing and having fun it it which was great to see. You can hire deck chair by the hour or day which is fab, as u can relax and enjoy the scenery. Will be back to see it again the next time we are in London.||August 31, 2018

bahrainia991||50||Hyde Park is the best place to have a walk and relax. Feeding the duck is what the kids love the most. So relaxing and excellent for early morning walks.||August 30, 2018
VoiceTheChange||50||I was passing through Hyde Park to visit and go to the Art Gallery for some exhibitions and I really enjoyed the vibes of this park with the swans, the ducks and the pedalos. I sat at the lounge chairs for a bit to take in some sun and enjoy the view. Lovely experience!||August 30, 2018
ShyoneChicago||40||Its a beautifully maintained park. Very touristy, but after a day of walking and touring, it as nice to site and enjoy the view.||August 30, 2018
Squiddlysid||50||My favorite thing in Hyde Park? First grabbing some sandwiches and crisps, some other snacks and plenty of water, then off to the park to visit Peter Pan, look at the nice trees and flowers, the beautiful ponds and fountains and just enjoy life! I´ve been here in the winter, during a torrential downpour and now this summer in the extreme heatwave and it always feels like a vacation day to spend 2 hours here :)||August 30, 2018
808rajeshs||50||The park is ver huge . Lots of walking.enjoyed the clean lake and greenary. Can see lot of birds ....shoul visit park||August 30, 2018
chrisy549||50||We enjoyed a long stroll exploring the park on our first day! It’s beautiful and so much to see and do! Counted dozens of squirrels and the parrakeets were a surprise!! Recommend the Diana memorial fountain; how lovely this is and to see people enjoying the flowing water and tranquility is wonderful. Lots of walking but enjoyable! Loved the Italian garden too! You could spend so much time here as there are over 340 acres!!!||August 29, 2018
samanthahN6982BA||50||On the suggestion of a friend we rented bikes from one of the bike stands in Hyde Park (these Santander stands are all over the city -you can rent/return from any stand). For 2GBP/hour, it’s a great deal, something different and a fun way to see the park. Our kids are 12 and 13 and they were just big enough as the bikes are designed for adults . Of all he things we did in London this was one of their favorites. Sometimes you don’t have to break the bank to have a great local experience !||August 29, 2018
JYT376||50||My daughter loved to watch and feed the ducks and swans there and we went there every time we travelled to London. A must-go park in London.||August 29, 2018
Noralí N||50||Wonderful place, very well-kept. There are play areas for kids with slides and games. It's a really nice place to visit...||August 29, 2018
purple-lallang||40||Visited recently and enjoyed it very much. As park is very big, suggest that you choose points of interest and walk accordingly to these sites. We started from the Marble Arch corner and walked diagonally to the Serpentine Bridge onto Kensington Gardens. It was relaxing with all the greenery around. ||August 29, 2018
Wendy B||50||We stayed at Queensway and had breakfast in the park near the Princess Diana playground. We then walked into Central London through the park, it was delightful we emerged at Buckingham Palace and also took in the sunken garden at Kensington Palace as well as the Albert Memorial. A lovely day to spend a Sunday morning.||August 28, 2018
coreylaw2018||30||Lovely to sit back and relax in Hyde Park. There are deck chairs available and after a day of exploring a nice place to unwind and take in London.||August 28, 2018

Samantha Jane M||50||This was a great stop off point on todays London outing... Lovely place to sit and watch the kids play, to just sit and eat or take a nice walk. Great pit stop for days out||August 28, 2018
skyde_k||50||A beautiful park in the middle of London. Great for leisurely stroll. I think you can rent a bike. Many people just taking a breather, or having a little picnic.||August 28, 2018
Mal H||50||Strolled thro this park several times, beautifully relaxing, as did everyone there, no hassles or dramas,just stroll and enjoy yourselves.Great.||August 28, 2018
Sean68UK||50||Lot to see and do from a gentle stroll to a leisurely jog. Floating in the Serpintine Lake was an interesting 20 metre high colourful barrel sculpture, The London Mastaba by Christo.||August 28, 2018
Aiah K||50||large area of green space, lots of oxygen. Recommend renting a bike for half day to explore the park, its worth it. ||August 28, 2018
EnduroAfrica007||40||A peaceful, eclectic oasis in the heart of London, bordering many top locations (Knightsbridge, Buckingham Palace, Park Lane, Royal Albert Hall, Kensington, etc). Hyde Park is enormous and therefore contains a variety of locations and things to do, from relaxing walks, the lake (which you can swim in in the summer), horse riding and plenty of places to cycle through and to.||August 28, 2018
Albert P||40||A grand yet calming place. Remarkable how quiet it is considering its proximity to traffic ridden London streets. Water, trees, swans, kids on bikes, dogs on leads and epic views in the distance.....a great place to visit both for tourists and residents alike..||August 28, 2018
750joost||40||Nice park but certain areas can be crowded as it is a very central location. Nice for picnics and days out, different things to see. Lots of birds by the lake and squirrels everywhere.Don't miss the Peter Pan statue and the parakeets.||August 28, 2018
aurobindom||40||What a huge park in the centre of London - just ehad here for a peaceful afternoon and do nothing but take in the sights and sounds!||August 28, 2018
Bitoman||50||Kensington Palace is inside this park and so are Swans a lot of people walking there dogs and enjoying the open cold fresh air. We did get a chance to experience the good outdoors weather in London but Hyde park was a heaven inside the big city. You miss open space greenery and a place to sit and enjoy nature in a metropolitan like London. And the fact that Kensington place is located inside the park is a great plus. You get to have a proper English tea, buy the best memorabilia for royal tea and the whole experience. The garden was beautiful for taking family pictures. But most importantly a great British History experience to be had.||August 28, 2018
anome2017||40||Perfect way of whiling away some hours in the heart of London. Hyde Park offers you a variety of activities whether it is the pedalos on the Serpentine, Princess Diana Memorial Gardens, the wonderful children’s playground, or finding Peter Pan this park offers you lots ||August 27, 2018
Kasra A||50||Perfect Place to be ! next to the birds, next to the lake and river - great view !! to walk along beautiful landscapes. Lovely tree's ...Fresh weather in the early morning - I will do it again for sure...||August 27, 2018

neerajasnani1999||50||The location of this enormous is its biggest strength, since you can go there to clear you mind right beside the forever crowded Oxford Street. Would definitely recommend for runs!||August 27, 2018
sammy534||50||The weather in London was amazing when we went, so we decided to pack a picnic basket filled with lots of yummy goodies, and a few drinks and head on down to Hyde Park. We went passed Buckingham Palace, and followed the 'Dianna' walk. We found a cozy place to sit down, had a few drinks, something to eat, lots of laughs. Its a really clean, beautiful Park. I would recommend everyone does it at least once (weather permitting of course). ||August 27, 2018
Space_Bunny_Dolphin||30||Huge park with a lot going on. There much to see with all the various activities going on by the lake, many cyclists so be careful.||August 27, 2018
Katie D||50||A lovely piece of nature in such a busy city, I used to walk from Charing Cross Road, through St James Park, Green Park, Hyde Park and to Kensington Gardens, all very close to each other, Kensington Gardens is a must visit for any Peter Pan fans, there is a statue in the gardens!||August 27, 2018
Navigator787415||50||Even though its pretty busy, it is peaceful and beautiful. We walked around alot. Very beautiful and we went when it was warm and sunny. Would love to go back and explore. Great for nature lovers!||August 27, 2018
rhianrli||50||It's a lovely walk, especially when you're following the Diana Trail. There's some beautiful scenery and the swans in the river are always magnificent. It's really refreshing to just sit down by the water and watch everybody having fun. :)||August 27, 2018
Michelle H||50||I'd advise you get a bike to get round it, lovely place to ride a bike. Lovely lakeside places to eat. I would have liked to have got a boat out and chilled a bit but didn't have enough time but will definitely come back to spend more time here. Cannot believe no child hasn't cracked their head though on the Diana water features, slipping and sliding all over the place!||August 27, 2018
AsifS60||50||Get some food and sit by the pound, you will enjoy it, it is so relaxing. I used to go there every month.||August 27, 2018
27VivG||40||As part of their summer schedule, there was an early evening Lego film show in the Park, which was great fun. Area was clean and efficiently run show was excellent for kids (although the film broke down a couple of times) and the food options were great. The day before we had gone to one of the playgrounds, which was again clean and tidy and the kids loved it there.||August 27, 2018

Jaktheman||50||A great place to visit, alone or with family and friends.It's a huge park and you can easily find somewhere to sit by yourself should you need to.Also, it's not too far from the bustling Oxford Street should you need a quick shopping fix.A definite recommend for all.||August 27, 2018
I637KMjaym||50||If the crowds have got you down, jump into the park for a leisurely stroll. You won't be disappointed. The birds are amazing. The memorial areas are beautiful and if you can, take an apple with you and feed the wild parrots. ||August 27, 2018
ThorpeParkCon||50||If the weather is good Hyde Park is a fantastic place to visit, right in the centre of London but so much green open space.||August 27, 2018
soumitnaik||50||Just the right place to head to refresh yourself. From speaker’s corner to Kensington Gardens it’s a fabulous walk in the greens in the heart of London ||August 27, 2018
Jeremy_Stratford||40||We walked through Hyde Park to get to Buckingham Palace. Its a lovely walk, and a miraculously peaceful place in the centre of such a busy city.And its free!! ||August 27, 2018
PrateekA126||50||Great place to come even by yourself for the much needed peace and quiet from the craziness of London streets. Bike here, bring a picnic or a good book. ||August 27, 2018
Sophie V||50||We visit Hyde Park everytime we’re in London. You can just go for a stroll, watch birds of chill with a drink and food. ||August 27, 2018
Oskar-Brooklyn||50||Beautiful but of country in the middle of the city. Gorgeous gardens, tame lawns, flower gardens, concrete and dirt trails. Cuts across a wide swath of London from speakers corner to Nottingham Hill. Not as manicured as NYCs Central Park in places feels like actual countryside Great place for a run or a walk. ||August 26, 2018
bth1991||20||Disappointing amount of rubbish lying around for a park in the city centre. Probably a combination of too many tourists, and a lack of attention from whoever runs it.||August 26, 2018
kochamkinie||40||A particularly good place to chill out when making tours to see the treasures of London. Lots of shade, some water.||August 26, 2018
PawelS380||40||Great place for family walks. We went there to see winter wonderland but had a long walk through the park as well. Parking is expensive but you can always take a bus or tube to get there. It’s nice for summer picnics and day out with kids or friends. ||August 26, 2018
usBroomfields||50||Absolute must for anyone visiting London. Summertime it's ideal for a picnic, and lovely for a stroll in the sunshine but winter it's home to Winter Wonderland, the fabulous Christmas market. Love Hyde Park.||August 26, 2018
srobby||50||Wonderful ponds attracting all sorts of water fowl with dozens of swans made a wonderful place to just sit and relax. The Princess Diana fountain was certainly not we expected for a fountain but it was well enjoyed by young and old which is what Diana would have liked.||August 26, 2018
More than M||50||A definite for anyone exploring London. Hire a Boris Bike and ride around Hyde Park, take some bread and feed the swans and stop for a coffee or ice cream. ||August 26, 2018
379leilaw||50||It’s such a nice park, for a walk, a picnic. It’s beautiful be it in the summer or winter. There a couple places to eat or drink, very expensive though ! ||August 25, 2018
Ghiatrain||40||We went through the park a few times during our visit. While it can get crowded it has nice sites such as Kensington Palace and Hyde Park Corner. Food and restrooms are plentiful. ||August 25, 2018
A C||50||We rented bikes with the Santander stands and loved biking from one end of Hyde park and back again. We found the iPhone App to be easy to use to find a place to rent with enough bikes for our family group. We physically rented the bikes at the kiosk where there were enough bikes. The entire rental was much easier and intuitive than when the bikes were first introduced to London. We felt safe biking through the park without helmets - big "no no" in our household. We stopped and enjoyed many of the sights in the park. It is a wonderful way to be outside and enjoy a large space in the center of London. A refreshing change to our weeklong tour of London.||August 25, 2018
Taughboyne||40||England's sustained 2018 summer drought has inflicted considerable damage on this venerable royal park but its still a great place to find relief from the capital's incessant buzz. When we visited, "Fire risk" signs were prominent and the only expanses of greenery were pond weeds and irrigated flower beds near the fountains as well as mature trees that looked heavily stressed and in some cases dying. Everything else was dried to a golden brown. Reminded me of the African savanna or the late summer hills of southern California. The Serpentine lake was a life saver full of boaters, moorhens, Canada geese and huge swans. Christo's huge temporary "Mastaba" installation perched itself atop the surface and attracted many people who seemed to appreciate the contrast between landscape art of different kinds. The park has enough small concession stands to keep hunger and thirst at bay, including one elderly Rolls Royce used as a very classy ice cream truck. You can be more or less alone in some parts of the park or sitting on serried rows of packed deck chairs in other places. I hope it recovers after the drought.||August 24, 2018
Mounia G||40||Had a beautiful day and an amazing experience I did enjoy the view from serpentine bar where I had a break after my tour ||August 24, 2018
Sharmini_Violet||50||Our friends been telling us that we have to visit the Hyde Park..also one of the reason we stayed nearby. Totally loved it.. such a nice park to have a nice walk, get to see squirrels, ducks, birds...Many people walk their dogs too and its great to see how everyone is so happy just hanging out at the park.Had a wonderful time||August 24, 2018
Juerg M||40||Fantastic park for endless walks; lots of birds. The present exhibition of Christo's Mastaba on Serpentine Lake is a must! Don't miss the explanations you'll find in Serpentine Gallery.||August 24, 2018
Alexandre K||50||A visit to London without a stroll in Hyde Park would not be a proper visit. Amazing well groomed and manicured gardens and a lake with boats and pedaloes to rent. ||August 24, 2018
Mark H||50||This park is kept up to an amazing standard, as are most of the London parks.Well done to the Borough Council, and all of the park-keepers, and thank you.||August 24, 2018
Patrick G||30||In order to get me convinced to go to London my wife offered me to go to the Hyde Park. She knew that I was keen of the Speaker`s Corner and so we went. The whole park is a big place of green. I was living in Dublin and didn`t expect much of garden work or any impressive installations but a big place to have some tranquility or space to do something. The park has one most corners boots where you can buy expensive coffee, hotdogs or ice cream. The temperature was on the day almost 40 degrees and we had to get use from the one or the other. The park has drinking fountains which my son has enjoyed playing with. These things are quite an adventure for a five years old that I can tell you. So, then we went to the famous corner... sadly we weren`t aware that they don`t speak there on a daily basis but only on Sunday mornings. We weren`t there on a Sunday but it was interesting to see that such a famous place was just a normal corner. No special desk or something to show where some has to stand or some other glamour. You may be surprised but I loved that it was a normal looking spot in the world. I have studied history and I was very happy that history doesn`t have to be all glamour to be special. My son needed a toilet since a couple of hundred metres so... My son and my wife found someone who gave them food to feed the pigeons around the same place. Toilets didn`t seem important anymore and the wee man and the wife were happay. They could pet them, while they fed them and I could make the first great holiday videos which was my thing. The toilets were located at a McDonalds close by which was again something for my son. For me that place was to crowded and the lads working there a little off this world but hey... other countries other lads.||August 23, 2018
sashaa30||50||Lovely park in the heart of London. I found the best time to go was a little later in the evening, it gets quite busy but starts to calm down towards sunset time. There are plenty of places to sit and relax. You can also see the Albert memorial here and The princess Diana memorial play ground. There's a lovely pond in the centre where you can see geese and ducks.||August 23, 2018
daniih48||50||Hyde park is a must for anyone visiting London. A beautiful big open space filled with nature and beautiful walks, a really good break from the hudtle and bustle of the surrounding city. If you go, make sure to take some bird seed for the abundant wildlife. Whether you have five minutes or the whole day, there is a lot to enjoy here (:||August 23, 2018
Anfrist||40||This is a large park with different areas, some greener, some more arid. It can be used as a shortcut to get to the center and for sport activities. Squirrels are lovely. ||August 23, 2018
David H||40||Hyde Park is so vast that there are always parts to explore that you havent seen before, but this time we just strolled through from Hyde Park Corner to Bayswater. It is a nice and peaceful oasis in a noisy and busy city, so good to just enjoy the sounds of nature and kids enjoying themselves.||August 23, 2018
brollan91||40||It's a really nice park with lots of little bits and bobs to look at. You can easily spend an hour just walking around admiring the beautiful nature, and there are several places to chill out or do whatever you would like. Easily accessed via the underground and in direct conection to both the Royal Albert Hall and Oxford Street. ||August 22, 2018

ian s||30||Always nice to walk through the park and watch the people and birds on the lake.We usually have a snack or lunch here in one of the two restaurants and visit the Gallery as well.||August 22, 2018
nihan19721969||40||I don’t think visiting London by skipping Hyde park would be wise at all. Especially take your children and visit this lovely place||August 22, 2018
ThisMamasMiles||40||A beautiful place to enjoy watch the wildlife, have a picnic, kick a ball, or just lay out under the sun.||August 22, 2018

gemburrasca||40||In summer my friends and I always spend afternoons at the Serpentine, close to the pond. Very relaxing, when it is sunny it is just astonishing! I always feel blessed of being in Hyde Park with the sunshine :)||August 21, 2018
Haralee||50||Loved the Rolls Royce Ice cream cart! This very hot summer saw thousands of people taking advantage of the water in the park. Great way to cool off||August 21, 2018
miaj0nes||50||Ideal for the toddlers to let off some steam in-between sightseeing, clean, tidy and peaceful. Lovely place to picnic and walk. Plenty of wildlife. ||August 21, 2018
StationToStation||50||Londoners frequent this park and so should visitors to London. Whether you want to visit one of the landmarks like Kensington Palace and their gardens, or just hang out in the park, on a nice day, it's a must. We took the opportunity to pick up some snacks from M & S and hang out in the park for a picnic and to kick a football around.||August 21, 2018
sunfloweer19||40||Lovely big park lots of wildlife and beautiful swans to see so nice when the weather is good but that's when it is busy the most||August 21, 2018
holidoddy||40||A lovely big space. My children were impressed by the trees.We were looking for a play park for the kids so followed the signposts which said play park, we walked & walked & walked and found nothing! We gave up looking. The next day we went to St James Park and found a lovely play park there. ||August 21, 2018
Pamela H||50||We decided to wander around Hyde Park on a warm sunny day recently and enjoyed the many things to see and do. The Serpentine Lake was the site of a magnificent art installation by Christo called The Mastaba, you can even go on a small viewing boat to see it close up. There are sculptures and statues everywhere. Enjoy viewing the Standing Stone Monolith, the elaborate and huge Prince Albert Memorial, the Peter Pan Statue, or the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial. These are just a few of the sights you can see. Be sure to allow plenty of time and wear comfortable shoes because this is one large park. There are art galleries, and Kensington Palace. Of course, if you want to just relax with a lawn chair and good book, the park is a perfect place to get away from the traffic and crowds in London. We had a wonderful time just walking around and people watching. Don't miss Hyde Park!||August 20, 2018
RoJim23||40||I lived in 10 minuets to Hyde Park, that’s very nice please, there are a lot of birds like Swan and duck, pigeon and more. If you want to spend time with friends or relatives your should take up food and go there.||August 20, 2018
EdwardVK||40||I did love running though this park early in the morning, it is quite large and multifaceted with ponds and swans and statues.||August 20, 2018
Bonnie K||50||A park is a park but this has Princess Diana's Garden, Kensington Palace and so much more. Great play area for kiddies, jogging, biking and strolling or just enjoying a picnic in the grass.||August 20, 2018
743marieh||40||First time I’ve ever actually walked through Hyde Park and was not disappointed.A very well kept park in the Heart of London...Lovely Seating Areas by the Lake watching the Ducks & Swans.A Couple of places to get refreshments from and of course Lady Diana’s Memorial Garden ....||August 20, 2018
Mickyj1973||40||A huge open green space in the centre of London, exactly what is required however the food and drinks on offer are extortionately priced as are the cost of hiring a Pedalo, £20 for a family of four for 30mins.||August 20, 2018
Ray J||40||When you are done shopping, or perhaps just fed up with that stuffy hotel, then Hyde Park is there to put you back in touch with nature.My favourite time to visit the park is early morning, with the mist drifting across the Serpentine it is quite magical.If you are stuck for something to do on a Sunday morning, then Hyde Park is the place to be, a quick stop at Speakers Corner which is near the Marble Arch inside the park, to listen to some opinionated political views, then onto a walk down the grand drive and then turn left towards the Serpentine for a well deserved coffee. Somehow the noise of the traffic seems almost to disappear.Well worth a visit.||August 19, 2018
alphusr2003||50||i walked around this park, started at a little over 5 AM, no one was there save for a few ducks and a lot of birds. The view was straight out of sleepy hollow, complete with the fog and the trees without leaves. But i soldiered on and when the sun started to come out, so did the joggers and the other tourists. mind you this is a huge park, it took me > 3 hours to walk from one gate to the lake part to the round pond, kensington palace, Albert Memorial, from the italian Gardens entrance. worth the effort though. Well done to the guy maintaining this park, worth the visit. ||August 19, 2018
terri3009||50||On a sunny day, wandering in the park, leaving manic city life behind. A wonderful escape and close to other sight seers musts. ||August 19, 2018
Anntec||50||Great to see this place being used by so many people , walking , running , riding , sitting , playing and relaxing . The gardens were well maintained and although there must have been thousands there each time we went through it doesn’t appear crowded . Great green area . ||August 19, 2018

laylaagarner||50||Even on a rainy day it was nice to walk from one side of the park to the other. Only thing is some areas of the footpath didn't have the best drainage but I don't particularly thinks thats an issue. Cool to see Kensington Palace and take my time going through to Kensington from Bayswater.||August 18, 2018
Jancrow4||50||Never walked through the park before and it's delightful. Italian garden, lido, Diana memorial. Loads to look at.||August 18, 2018
klingdaklongoh||50||Very well known and really nice park in Central London. I'd definitely recommend spending a little time here if you are visiting, or of course for residents too.||August 18, 2018
SWATTWorld||50||We rented Bikes in Hyde Park. Very good idea to get around and see everything. Great family outing. Don't miss the Princes Diana memorial fountain. ||August 17, 2018
MLGeogLeics||50||Following a manic afternoon, we took our boys across Hyde Park Corner and onto the park for an evening stroll. They loved running around playing hide and seek around the trees, watching the boats on the Serpentine and the planes descending towards Heathrow to the south. You don't have to get far onto the park to escape the noise of traffic, but beware impatient cyclists!||August 17, 2018
Fil S||50||First off you have Dianas memorial(which opens at 10 am), and playground. The latter has tables and concession stand. Kensington Palace is a short walk (it opens at 10 and is about 25 pounds entrance)The gardens are always open, must say somewhat disappointing, considering who now lives there.Large park with lots to see...Italian garden, Marble Arch, swimming area etc.Recommendation would be to rent bikes to go through park. Santander bikes- look into them as they are excellent way of getting around for only 2pounds per day. You just need to check in every 30 minutes which is not a problem.Great way to spend a day in the park!||August 17, 2018
hapgi||50||An Oasis in the the heart of London. A shame that much of the park is shut off during the summer to accommodate concerts, but still a respite from the pollution and noise surrounding it||August 17, 2018
nicolabR5344CZ||50||A delicious meal in a contemporary setting, looking out towards the Serpentine River, Hyde Park.Chucs restaurants are great for delicious Italian food, We’ve eaten in several. Charming helpful staff are in all of them.I have though, chosen to write about the Chucs at West Carriage Drive, Hyde Park. We had a great meal, the airy restaurant was buzzing. There is a warm atmosphere and a delicious menu.It is the waiting and bar staff who are exceptional here. Simona was attentive and got all the orders right...including a rather complicated cocktail (made to my own recipe) - the bar lady was great!As we left the restaurant, feeling happy and full, my husband said he looked forward to going back again soon. High praise indeed!||August 16, 2018
Bernoose||50||Easy strolling down many pathways. Lots of open grass or benches to stop and relax. Enjoyed cooling feet off by playing in the Diana Memorial Fountain. There are restrooms and a place to grab some food and drinks. A very relaxing afternoon in London. ||August 16, 2018
margaret g||50||What could be more lovely than cream tea at Kensington Palace cafe in the wonderful London summer. The scone, jam, clotted cream and ice cold ginger beer were perfect on such a hot day. Brouse through the gift shop and then have tea. Sit in the sun, go for a tour of the Palace, walk or bike through Hyde Park, paddle in the water, read a book or just enjoy all the people.||August 16, 2018
stephenlN8064ZB||50||We visited on a overcast but very warm day in London and had a great time. The memorial fountain was great fun for our 10 year old and a top way to cool off on a hot day the current barrel work of art in the serpentine is a must see for London. My advice would be to take a blanket and make a picnic to make the most of this stunning green space in the city. ||August 16, 2018
DudeBK||50||I stood near this park and it was worth it. I loved it and it’s absolutely gorgeous and peaceful. Everything was so clean and green. It was definitely better than going to NY Central Park I’ll definitely say that much. ||August 16, 2018
SaloTunsAlegria||50||My husband and I used to live in London, so we know this place very well.I think the park is beautiful and is nice to go for a run, or just have a walk or a picnic.My favorite thing to do every time I go back to visit London: wake up very early while London is still asleep, get a hot coffee, and sit on a bench in the park.. The silence, the fog... I can’t explain it! Love it!||August 15, 2018
Dawn C||50||When we were in London the weather was lovely and the park was full. You can hire a deck chair and there are areas for playing football or playing with your kids or dogs. Lots of beautiful trees for cover. Very family friendly ||August 15, 2018
Yasmin J||50||I am in Love with Hyde Park, I don’t feel I am in London unless I visit it.It’s located in central London, very big and have more than one lake.You will enjoy walking around the lakes feeding the ducks , jogging in the middle of the trees .There is more than one cafe inside the park, you can chill and enjoy the view, also you can enjoy your time by renting boat for half or one hour for only €10 / €12 .You can enter the park from more than one gate.Go and visit it, don’t miss this amazing nature atmosphere.||August 14, 2018
PiaAA1000||50||It a lovely big park where you can find some quiet places away from the stress and noise of London City. ||August 14, 2018
DougW907||40||In central London, Hyde Park covers about 350 acres between in the east Mayfair and to the west Kensington. To the north lies Bayswater and to the south Knightsbridge. The park layout is mostly informal with only relatively small areas for flower beds such as the rose garden which is located in the south east section near to Hyde Park Corner. There are however other attractions that visitors can enjoy such as an area near to Marble Arch which on Sunday mornings becomes Speaker Corner and which has a great tradition of free speech and during its long history has hosted such luminaries as Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and George Orwell. There are two playgrounds for children, one of which in Kensington Gardens and is in memory of Princess Diana, as is the splendid Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, a running water feature that is a beautiful and thoughtful tribute to the late Princess.There are two art galleries, a couple of restaurants and various sporting activities such a tennis and bowls plus horse riding. There is also open air swimming and boating on the Serpentine lake.The lake is in the centre of the park and has both pedalos and rowing boats for hire in which you can spend a lovely relaxing hour on the water. We have been many times to Hyde Park and love to picnic and spend time on the water there.||August 14, 2018
pussycat72016||50||Hyde Park is a quiet haven in the centre of a bustling city. At one end is Kensington Palace, home of the Diana collection, whilst Speakers Corner and Buckingham Palace make up other corners. The lake in the centre is also complimented by beautiful gardens and monuments scattered throughout. Many cycleways have been added so it can be enjoyed on two wheels. A quiet stroll is a must.||August 14, 2018
Mo B||50||Cliche but there is something for all the family in Hyde park. Cycling, rowing, walking and lots of joggers. We enjoyed our walk visiting peter pan sculpture and then Princess Diane memorial. Then enjoyed life going by at the busy cafe by the lake where they serve some tasty treats. You could easily pass 1 or 6 hours in this park. Because of rain we stuck to 2 on this occassion.||August 13, 2018
apritchy||50||This is a beautiful, big park where you could spend many hours, especially on a hot sunny day. There are many things to see and do. ||August 13, 2018
simtayl||50||Recently had a walk through the park and stopped for lunch at the restaurant on the Serpentine Lake, absolutely gorgeous. My American wife was really amazed at how stunning it was||August 13, 2018
Valdirah||50||Hyde Park is an excellent place for a walk on a sunny day. There are several kilometers of paved walking routes, lovely gardens, and of course the Serpentine where you can swim or hire a pedalo. There are also a cafe and several toilets in Hyde Park.||August 13, 2018
RichardA3246||50||This is a great park and I've been on a number of occasions. The definite highlight this time was Christo's "Mastaba" : a giant 600 ton sculpture made of red, pink and purple oil drums, sitting in The Serpentine. Weird but awe-inspiring. It's only there until September 2018 - go now! ||August 12, 2018
Lenise B||50||The wide open green spaces, the gardens, the waterfowl, the water, the Peter Pan statue, the memorial areas...it's a wonderful park to stroll through.||August 12, 2018
339hollyb||50||Go here- See it firsthand. It's probably the most relaxing magical stroll you can take through London. You don't even feel like you're in the city any longer, just in this transcendental place that makes you feel like you're in a different place and time. ||August 12, 2018
OhoodB3||50||On daily basis i need to pass by with my family to the hyde park. Beautiful atmosphere. Thank you so much. ||August 12, 2018
martyblack83||50||A really nice and big park in central London, in fact the largest of the Royal Parks. It's a great place to relax when there weather is good and is also the location for the annual Winter Wonderland too. There's plenty of tube stops near-by so it's easy to get to. There's lovely scenery, especially with the water running through it and plenty of sculptures to look at too.||August 12, 2018
rajmunot||50||I had a great time walking around Hyde Park. I cherish the energetic yet peaceful atmosphere I experienced at Hyde Park.If you want to make the most of your visit, do opt for Cycling along the park and Boating. These are two things I highly recommend doing.||August 12, 2018
Giulio M||40||The park is beautiful and huge. it really seems to be in the middle of the forrest with huge trees and dense vegetation. It is one of the few places where its possible to relax be alone and listen to the birds singing instead of ambulances buzzing. I recommend to go there wit friends, have fun with a ball or a freesbe and have and detach your mind from the caos of London. ||August 12, 2018
judy c||50||Visited yesterday for the first time .Absolutely beautiful park.Stunning, relaxing and breathtaking .So huge what more could you want. Will be returning one day.||August 12, 2018
Paantha||30||We were excited to visit the park from all the reviews and recommendations. But I must say I was disappointed after the visit. It was overcrowded and not enough play area for kids. I was hoping for more open space. The park was beautiful and is worth a visit (in the non peak season)but skip the children’s play area - not worth it. ||August 11, 2018
njydevon||10||Morning walk through was amazing, there were tourists about but not overly busy. Good sineage, the children tried to spot the variety of birds, we didn’t manage to find any pelicans though. The bird man was interesting as were the very large fish. Lovely flower display despite the hot weatherAs we got closer to Buckingham Palace we found the tourists so we went to the left and heard the band preparing for the changing of the guard which was amazing ||August 11, 2018
heshnosaff||50||Hyde Park is huge and lovely. Our family spent quite some time there several times during the week that we visited London. There are lots of ducks, swans, and other birds, and the highlight--parrots who love to be fed and will literally eat out of your hand. The kids and the adults LOVED the latter experience.||August 11, 2018
Stewart W||50||I grew up in the Paddington/Bayswater area and often went for long walks in Hyde Park with my family and friends. I remember the peaceful atmosphere and beautiful scenery all around.||August 10, 2018
canadaace||50||Great place to run or walk with the family. It seems to be a very safe place as there are always families playing sports or just relaxing under a tree. It is clean. I liked the fact that cyclists were restricted to where they could go so parents didn't have to worry about their toddler running around and getting hit. And on the flip side there were plenty of paths for the cyclists and they could expect pedestrians to not constantly be in their way.There is a cool looking art installation right now which we had to google later right in the middle of the lake. So many things to see and do in the park. You wouldn't be able to see it all in one day!||August 10, 2018
Shirley S||40||No wonder Princess Diana preferred Kennsington Palace and Hyde Park. It is huge and beautiful and peaceful!! We were on a mobility trolley and toured the grounds. Thanks to Wills the guide!||August 10, 2018
anitad623||40||A lovely park for a stroll, look out for a celebrity or two you may be lucky, also maybe get to see the queens horses getting their exercise.||August 10, 2018
b00mer2018||40||Huge park so much to enjoy if you are looking for a getaway walk away from the city streets. The Rose garden (near Hyde Park Corner tube station end) was lovely and fragrant in late July despite the drought year (2018). ||August 10, 2018
Shafiq M||50||Diana Memorial Fountain area is a wonderful area for kids and sitting and chilling watching the day pass.was there late July when it was Baking HOT.kids loved it, Adults sitting eating playing and the ladies well......chat chat chat..we had a birthday cake and picnic all in one.had a great day.oh''' get there early as the car parks get full......||August 10, 2018
PaulMarc||50||I forgot what a big Park this is!! Especially with Too lazy hot children in tow!!We headed for The water fountain play. Both my kids 9 And 17 liked cooking off in The streams of water.The Lido looked like fun. You could actually swim in The lake, And it was nearly empty!! But we didn’t have our swimming stuff!!The Park had a nice bustling atmosphere, but not overly crowded. Families hired paddle boats, strolled by The lake, sipped Pimm’s And ate ice creams in The Sunshine.We were intrigued by The big pink thing in The middle of The lake!! ||August 10, 2018
cwate7||50||Hyde Park is famous, and deservedly so. It has space to walk, picnic, stroll, jog, sprint, ride and sit. Do take an umbrella. As one of my British friends said, " You're in England now, not Australia. Always carry a brolly, and leave the sunscreen at home." Well I eventually remembered the brolly - thank goodness!- but continued to wear sunscreen. I guess there are too many habits to break. ||August 9, 2018
ssabry8476||50||Hyde park is relaxing garden with so many activities, we enjoyed feeding the birds and ducks, playing football, walking, jogging||August 9, 2018
Narziss||50||Hyde Park is a very central location which provides really pleasant walks and views of both the lake and gardens and is a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city.||August 9, 2018
Chelseax2||40||Very well organised event, maybe more toilets spread across the event rather than one block where the cues were long. £5 per can of beer / cider and many food stalls available too. The security wasn’t as strict as what it applied in the email and people had bigger bags and blankets but very strict around food and drinks being brought in to the event.||August 9, 2018
rod_meldrum||20||Very disappointing since our last visit- unkept lawns and grassland. Many people having lunch and just leaving their mess behind.||August 9, 2018
Donadisi||50||If you want spend your day off in a green area, quiet but amazing this is a perfect place for you!!during the summer probably it’s gonna be nicer but all of the year you can have a fun there!||August 9, 2018
slavicaonions||50||We visited Hyde Park at the start of the Summer Holidays in the beautiful Summer Sun and it was blissful. We did the little galleries and walked along the Serpentine water edge. The Princess Diana Fountain was lovely too. There are lots of lovely statues to look at as well as loads of food/drink sellers! Due to the heat we ended up stopping at about 6 drinks sellers all charging £2/£3 a Can of pop so make sure to either take drinks or change to buy some! The grounds are beautiful with flowers every where and wild life too - we had a squirrel come for food and butterflies land next to us too. Very clean all over with the bins emptied regularly we were very impressed! ||August 9, 2018
patwell2018||10||First time visiting Hyde Park. It is beautiful. Lots of people using the open spaces. Plenty on benches to sit and watch world go by. Very clean. Lovely ice cream van. Would recommend a visit and maybe a picnic||August 9, 2018
Catherine B||40||We were staying between Paddington Station and Hyde Park. The Park was a wonderful place to relax and listen to other opinions. Highly recommend an hour or more to relax and take it all in. ||August 9, 2018
AlisonW734||50||A perfect place for a romantic wander through the park, along the Serpentine. Plenty of places to sit and rest a while, watch the ducks and swans, or just take in the peace and tranquility, rarely found in the centre of a capital city. Enjoy.||August 9, 2018
Rashid A||40||Great location in attractive area you can have fun with your family and eat some ice cream in the great weather ||August 8, 2018
Jus J||40||Great atmosphere when there is an event. Great for long walks, fantastic for riding lots to see ie: lakes horses etc A nice cafe bar by the lake. Decent parking. ||August 8, 2018
britseyeview||50||We wanted to visit the V&A and decided to talk through Hyde Park rather than take the tube from Paddington. It was a great choice as we got to see the Princess Diana Fountain Memorial, Kensington Palace, and just outside the Albert Hall and Albert Memorial. We also saw the Flying Trapeze school in action. This plus all the huge leafy trees, the river with its ducks and swans made for a great day put||August 8, 2018
Maria A||50||Our family really enjoyed visiting this park in the summer. There is a playground, paddle boats for rent, and food kiosks. We were lucky enough to catch the Queen's cavalry practicing while we were there. I highly recommend it.||August 8, 2018
MaltaBound||50||We were able to relax here, both in the shade on foldout chairs, and then along the lake to admire the wild ducks and geese. The park is quite large and a good break from the craziness of the city if you can find time to relax.||August 8, 2018
affy1979||50||This is the perfect place for a date or a picnic on a nice hot summers day in London. Hyde Park is a famous location very close to central London and has many special memorials and has many places of interest within the park. There is the Princess Diana Memorial as well as Italian Fountains and as well as Prince Albert Memorial too. ||August 8, 2018
Caw20||50||London has some of the best City parks in the world and this is up there with the bestYou can sit and watch the world go by or follow one of the many paths.Take my advice go and buy some picnic lunch and head off. You will have a lovely day. The food in the park can be a little expensive. Enjoy||August 8, 2018
alangS9927PG||50||We stayed a an hotel by Hyde Park for the last 10 days. We were able to walk through the park on a number of days. Lots to see and do !||August 8, 2018
23irinan||40||I wanted to take a walk alone so I thought Hyde Park would be the perfect place. It is not quite, you will see a lot of tourists, but it is a nice park. You can see swans and if you are lucky, baby swans- they are so so cute. I enjoyed my walk and I took a break to read, but I can't say this is my favourite park in London.||August 8, 2018
Torger S||50||A very nice park with a lot of birds swimming around in the water. A perfect place to rest after/before a busy day in London.||August 8, 2018
nevaeh666||50||Lovely park for a walk, it has a great playground, great icecream in the boardwalk cafe and loads to see. ||August 8, 2018
Hazel R||50||Hyde Park is where you'll find an equal mix of Londoners and tourists. You can swim at the lido, take a boat onto the lake, sit in the rose garden, or walk through meadows. There's lots of ancient trees. Cafes have scenic locations but could be more environmentally friendly if used less plastic glasses and paper cups.||August 8, 2018
Toby823||50||I visit Hyde Park in the morning, there was quite and peaceful.I cycling on my Brompton around the park, stop at anywhere on the grass, what a wonderful day.||August 7, 2018
jkm411||40||Visited the park while staying nearby to get some exercise. Despite the heat in London, the park was safe, pleasant and shady. Very easy to negate the exercise with the ice cream stands around the edges of the park! Nice respite from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street. ||August 7, 2018
Kiran K||40||I visited this park on one of the hottest days of the year. Lots of paths to walk on but not enough benches compared to the number of people that are in the park. I didn't manage to see the whole park as it was too hot and made me feel very tired. The park is located in the heart of all the attractions and transport links. Overall, will have to visit again to take in the beautiful sights of the park. I recommend this park to all just to get away from the busy life of London.||August 7, 2018
kkatariinajj||50||We rented a bike for 2 pounds and just cycled around the park. It was so beautiful. Everyone had something to do there||August 7, 2018
jomckerrell||50||had a great day just wandering around, up to Kensington palace, around the boasting lake, speakers corner, bit weird, but maybe that's just me! considering it was July and the poor poor grass is just dust due to the weather it was wonderful to see families picnicking and playing together, ||August 7, 2018
Maite C||50||Thanks to Hyde Park and its nice trees and shadows make you feel confortable. You can seat and relax in a perfect environment!||August 7, 2018
yousefsa2000||30||not much expectations. Lakesides in middle were best sightseeing in Hyde Park but cleanliness is poor. Sunday is crowd. I did not see interesting things other than people visiting it. Just another park.||August 7, 2018
Jimmy W||40||Perfect for the day when walking is the flavour and a coffee during a stop or maybe an ice cream on a warm day. really is a family relaxing day out, perfect for a Sunday.||August 7, 2018
georgeeboy||50||Hyde Park is one of the Capitals best parks you must visit the lake and see the swans with their cygnets the garden area is very relaxing and Photographic.||August 7, 2018
martinidoc||30||It used to be a bit of a novelty in the 70's to have a free public concert in Hyde Park. However the park is now almost perpetually occupied with expensive commercial concerts or winter wonderlands. When not occupied, large swathes of the grass require repair. The cycle lane on the Eastern edge is restricted, with no other reasonable cycling diversion available. Perhaps this has gone too far?||August 6, 2018
car0lann47||40||We were dropped there by coach as London traffic and a bike race meant he could not drop us. Near the Houses of Oarliament.After the initial disappointment we decided to enjoy the park, and we did.The day helped!The peddle boats were great fun and the staff great, helping disabled hubby in and out!He sat back and grandson and I worked!It was fun.It was lovely to see the outdoor swimming area being used.The park was beautifully maintained and litter free!It is fair to say we probably had a better time than being in crowds!||August 6, 2018
Ayay01||50||We decided to have some rest, rented a few chairs and enjoyed a peaceful sunset at the park. The chairs are quite expensive but contribute to a relaxing rest after a long day of walking....||August 6, 2018
Matt G||50||Hyde Park. Classic London scenery, some great street art vendors, loads of people taking in the beautiful weather. Plenty of ways to enjoy the Park, but I hiiiighly recommend you rent yourself a snazzy pair of roller skates/blades and join the huge group that rolls (literally) through Hyde Park and the streets of London. Not for the faint of heart or physically unfit, but quite a workout and a blast! You stop for ice cream/water about halfway into the two hour experience, so I guess you could meet your out of shape friend there. Skate group happens on Sunday afternoons for the easiest skate, then more advanced skates (longer distance/faster pace) on Thursday evenings||August 6, 2018
stephgirl90||50||A must see. The nicest park I have seen so far. If you are an active person like me, this place is a runners dream. Not to hilly and multiple path to run on and admire the different scenery, from monuments, to ponds, to water fountains and Kensington palace. Even if you are not a runner it is a great place to walk around a little and stop with a picnic to have lunch.||August 6, 2018
NatalieB2557||50||Hyde Park is a must especially in the summer. Order a picnic hamper from Fortnum and Mason. Kensington Palace is great! Beautifully kept and a great place to see if you are a Diana fan. ||August 6, 2018

magdatabac||50||I love this park. It's always a good place to be, regardless if I go there with friends or alone, to run or to walk, or just pass through on my way to someplace else. ||August 6, 2018
roamingtraveller92||40||Hyde park in the summer is a hive of activity. Everywhere you look there is something to do or somewhere to explore. In the summer months when the weather is nice you can just sit on the grass and enjoy the sunshine. Despite the scale of it, the park can get extremely busy on weekends and feel quite crowded. If you have something in mind that you you are going to do it might be worth going a little earlier in the day to ensure you don't have to wait too long.||August 6, 2018
s-detail-s||50||I was there with my friends and colleagues. Running from traffic jams and London rush - we found our perfect spot in Hyde park. Absolut A+||August 6, 2018
Ben D||40||Its a nice large park in London, its a great place to go and relax and take your time. There is a few bike rental spots around the park so you will usually find a bike if you want one. Its quite clean to as there are cleaning staff all over the place. Has easy access by tube as well||August 6, 2018

Robin_Knowles||50||Hyde Park is large and it is nice to walk in or sit. At the entrance near Lancaster Gate underground Station (Central Line) there are some nice fountains that are very impressive.There are plenty of places to sit and lots of shade under trees.Hyde Park connects with Kensington Gardens, is vast, and it is easy to get disorientated. This is one of my favourites London parks.||August 6, 2018
adancing||50||I visited during Christmas time and there was the Christmas village, so I found it enchanting and so much fun, the park itself is huge and never ending, and even in December it had so much charm.||August 5, 2018
H2630RDlaurenceb||40||A fantastic park for all the family. Great gardens and water features too. Just such a shame about all the hot weather turning the grass green. Excellent place for evening stroll.||August 5, 2018
davidhW2983CV||40||Very excited to get tickets for the BST for my wife, as she is a big fan of Michael Bublé.We got tickets for the accessibility platform, as my wife has issues walking long distances and standing for any length of time. Disappointed that the platform itself is quite a long walk from the disabled entrance. Anyway, you we got there, the facilities and view were good. Settled in and started to watch the support acts in the blazing sun. Good selection of food and drink and good to see that they provided free water for everybody.As for the support acts, The Feeling were great, Bananarama were pure cheese but good fun, Van Morrison was very disappointing - never smiled and zero interaction with the crowd. Towards the end of his set, the heavens opened and we all got soaked, despite the free ponchos being handed out - I think at least the disabled area should be covered.The rain almost eased in time for the main man, though and what rain there was didn't phase him at all. Bublé was fantastic and his voice as glorious as ever. Laughing and joking and interacting with his fans, he showed others how to perform! What a star!||August 5, 2018
756rachelm||50||Hyde Park is lovely to walk around, especially on a warm summers evening. It’s a nice place to take a picnic or if you’d rather be more active to cycle around.||August 5, 2018
Panos-Iliana||50||Very nice park. I love walking or cycling every part of it. If it sunny it is the best place to visit at central London. ||August 5, 2018
Zwerski||40||Hyde Park is a pretty and calm spot inside busy London. Many pedestrians, and loads of bicycle commuters use the park as a cut-through during the commute, so look out or you'll get run over. In the evenings, locals hang out and picnic. and parts of it are near Royal Albert Hall, presenting more touristy stuff to do while there. Worth a visit.Tip: bring along 20p coins to use in the restrooms in the park. Otherwise, it is a long walk to available restrooms.||August 5, 2018
RobMac60||40||New to London, Hyde Park was on the list. The park’s fine. The people watching is quite interesting. This hot 2018 summer has browned parts of the Park. Unusual for the Brits, but common sight for an Australian. Pity it’s looking a bit “Australian”.||August 5, 2018
DavidsonL268||50||In places you wouldn't even know you are in London. The centre of the park is quiet. Very large and full of activities to do. Many pop up cafes on site so plenty of places to buy drinks etc. Toilet facilities all around. ||August 5, 2018

SherylFarnan||40||Beautiful park and nice setting for the walk to Kensington Palace and through to Notting Hill. Very calm. Some bike paths for riders to enjoy.||August 4, 2018
Heidi B||50||hyde park was so big so my son and I decided to rent bikes in order to see everything. The grass was a little brown due to no rain but the lakes were still busy with wildlife and flowers in bloom||August 4, 2018
Trixieinfinity||30||It is a huge green (not this August) space with very little signage and when you need the loo it is very frustrating! We would have liked to used the paddling pool however you all have to pay and when 2 adults are watching 1 child it isn't worth it . We wandered down to the Diane water feature which has one entrance at the furthest possible place from the rest of the park. Just like Diana’s life as a Royal near but kept away from the rest of the Royals. As it was a very hot day the water feature was like a blob of jam covered in ants. As the heatwave was in full swing the ground is dry and crispy, when you visit London your first thought is always I must pack a picnic blanket. Frankly coming from the Peak District I wasn’t impressed we have better parks maybe no Royals but better signage and park maps.||August 4, 2018
BambiExplores||50||I decided to repeat last year's success and went for the BST Concert with Eric Clapton & Santana plus guests on July 08 2018 in a extremely hot Hyde Park. I again went for Golden Circle tickets. I do believe that the extra cost is worth it as you can get much closer to the stage. Next year, however, I'm pretty sure I'll go one better and will try to get Diamond View tickets, if the right band is playing. Again the concert area was literally stuffed with people from all over the world, we were 115.000, I was told. But still no trouble as the organisation of the concert was good.The concert itself was excellent and sound was fine too. Santana played for 75 minutes and Clapton for 120 minutes, and they finished the evening by playing together. An absolutely fabulous evening in Hyde Park!||August 4, 2018
RealFoodieGirl||40||We had a really good walk around this huge parking taking in the beautiful plants and flowers. We also had a look at Diana's memorial which is like a huge circle of water that the kids like to play in and walk around, so a glorified paddling pool but I'm sure Diana would be smiling down knowing that children are getting such fun out of it!A huge park with lots of paths, fairly busy but not surprised and it didn't infringe on our visit on a Tuesday. The cafes there are quite expensive for water, drinks, food etc so i would suggest taking your own and finding a nice bench to sit on and admire the views.We would come here again when we next come to London.||August 4, 2018
GPSTan||40||Toddler loved looking at the ducks at Hyde park and running around freely. Great place to chill, worth visiting during the summer! ||August 4, 2018
McMilkyyy||40||Lovely day for it, very busy. Good location in London and a lovely place for a picnic with my young boys. ||August 3, 2018
kaufmansn||50||We visited Hyde Park for the first time to see the Christo installation of the London Mastaba. It was stunning - 650 tons of floating barrels - but the rest of the park was impressive as well! We enjoyed watching the children play in Princess Diana's Memorial Fountain. She would have been so pleased with the happy sounds. The walk was pleasant with wide trails, nature, and flanked by iconic English sites.||August 3, 2018
Helenmarie1||30||Upon visiting its a vast park with not a lot there, the children's play area was ok but very easy to lose your child if they run off. Have been to a lot better parks.||August 3, 2018
krystenaj||40||Went to see the main headline act, Bruno mars. As there weren’t many other acts we wanted to see we just sat and chilled in the sun and enjoyed this lovely park in a nice setting. ||August 3, 2018
Travel814183||40||It is a huge park where is over your imagonation if the weather condition is available i would recommend you to have a picnic there ||August 3, 2018
Catherine F||50||A lovely day out for a walk on a warm day. Lots of nice cafes for food, coffee or ice cream. Beautiful gardens and iconically English views ||August 2, 2018
Linda B||50||My granddaughter and I spent a couple of hours in Hyde Park on a recent trip to London. It was lovely. We ate at a restaurant there that had tables on the lake and enjoyed watching the swans and the boaters. ||August 2, 2018
iatetheplate||50||This is a great family place for picnics sports activities walking or just sitting and enjoying the view. It's one of the largest and most popular public green spaces in central London and is famous for its Sunday debates on speakers corner.||August 2, 2018
Andrew081||50||I visited Hyde Park on a hot summers day. On entering the park (from Hyde Park corner) that first thing you see is the huge statue of Achilles made from 33 tonnes of captured cannons (monument to the Duke of Wellington). The park is dotted with memorials to various people.The Serpentine Lake was buzzing with activity: loads of people on the lake in boats (cost adult: £10.50 child: £7.50, cheaper before noon) or enjoying the lido (cost adult: £4.80, child: £1.80) - near the Lido is the Princess of Diana Memorial Fountain where you can dip your feet for free) or enjoying one of the two cafes (there is also a restaurant at the Sackler Gallery which is just inside Kensington Gardens). There was the a 20-metre-high sculpture floating on the lake made of 7,506 painted barrels (there until 23 September 2018) – this was worth visiting just to see this.Horse Guards can be seen in the park very early in the morning, then they leaves Hyde Park Barracks at 10:28am on weekdays (9:28am on Sundays) and rides to Horse Guards Parade passing through Hyde Park Corner, returning an hour or so later – again well worth seeing.After having some refreshments, dipping my feet into the Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, I had a quick wonder through the rose gardens, saw the Huntress Fountain, then continued my adventures elsewhere.Hyde Park is the largest Royal Park in London covering 142 hectares (350 acres) and remains open throughout the year from 5 a.m. until midnight. During the summer a large area is given over to outdoor concerts. From mid-Nov to early January there is the Winter Wonderland Christmas fair and market to see and enjoy.||August 2, 2018
AudreyB793||50||I would love to visit again during the rainy season. The weather was unusually warm during our visit, so the grounds were now green. It was a great adventure close to the underground and we enjoyed getting away from the crowds.||August 2, 2018
shaashh||50||One of most beautiful park in UK and very popular Very close to shopping, royal castles and other sitesGood for relaxing and jogging ||August 1, 2018
Paul S||40||My daughter had bought a couple of tickets for the Paul Simon Homeward Bound concert with support from James Taylor and Bonnie Rait as well as a host of lesser-known acts.The park makes a great setting for such an event, with so much space that there is plenty of room for all the food and drinks amenities and other facilities and amusements to make it a very fulfilling day out. We were there from about 3pm to the finale at 10'ish.I have been lucky enough to have been there several times for such an event and it is always a delight to get there early and have a walk around the Serpentine and just generally enjoy this huge beautiful space in the heart of London.||August 1, 2018
Raisa A||50||So we were there at the last day of out trip. Which weirdly after the heatwave it became the most cold winded and rainy day. Beautiful place to walk and also to ride the bike. Lots of places to seat and take a break.||August 1, 2018
eppieo||50||Tied w St Jame's and Holland Park as my favourite green spaces in London, Hyde Park used to be a place for hunting and has a traditional gathering magnetism for rallies & protests, where anyone can climb onto a soapbox and soeak their mind... the breathtaking gardens and magnificent trees open up to people of all walks of life...peace has a better chance in nature than in concrete||August 1, 2018
Wakayoo||40||We saw a lot of people enjoying them self with a lot of different activities. We also met a squrrel that trieid to charm us for food. It was nice and clean, but there was a lack of green gras this time. ||August 1, 2018
Lia95pri||50||We loves this park for a lot of squirrel comes near people. We gave some pinuts at squirrel. Ti was very great !!! ||August 1, 2018
DiogoM1458||50||Hyde Park is, for me , the best park in London to walk, ride a bike and it is the place where you can have some peace and silence. ;)||July 31, 2018
HeatherM5518||50||The Diana Memorial play park is so beautifully designed that it was a joy for us all to spend time there. It kept the kids captivated for hours. Great toilet and snack facilities. We enjoyed a lovely walk afterwards to see the swans. ||July 31, 2018
SergeLourie||50||I had to get from Marble Arch to South Kensington and as I had an hour to spare, decided to walk. It really was a revelation.After the initial difficulty of crossing the roads at Marble Arch I walked south westwards across the large grass expense; then there was a walk through a wooded area; along the lovely Serpentine; and then out and along Exhibition Road. It was lovely.Londoners are so lucky to have this large Royal Park and I loved the art installation in the middle of the Serpentine||July 31, 2018
Mansour007||50||No matter how often I visit this park I just can't get bored with it, it's so diverse, so big, a place for nature's habitat, people's activities, riding horses, sitting under the trees on a slope and enjoying a drink, or even visiting Winter village during Xmas time, must visit place in London.||July 31, 2018
triper2014||30||Free and worth wondering around some parts are great for relaxing in or putting your feet into cold water (Diana's Memorial park) Very dried out grass not suprrising considering the weather||July 31, 2018
gabecichon||50||Hyde Park takes the cake as the largest and most diverse in activities than all of the other parks. If you don't want to hop from park to park and you just want to spend a day at the park, you have to look no further. Go to Hyde and enjoy a snack while sitting next to the lake watching some ducks or rent a boat out to the lake and enjoy the sun and the water around you. There's plenty of cafes and huge fields to sit down for some peace and quiet. This park is so spread out, it seems impossible for it to be crowded. Even on a packed day, it will feel like you have plenty of space to yourself. Go and enjoy!||July 31, 2018
johnkenn2018||50||Hyde Park is a wonderful place that anyone can enjoy any time of the day or season whether you are strolling through the trees or paddling on the boats, playing football or having a bite in one of the restaurants ||July 31, 2018
Alayjafalls||50||Last summer (2017)i spented most of my week lying around in hyde park with my wife, just talking and watching the day go by.I have never had such a good time in my life, there is so much to do.We walked around the park for hours, and it was just nice to be somewhere were people will give you your own space and you can just be with someone you love.I know that sounds really cheesy but it is true.U recommend it for young couples hwo just want to be together but dont necessarilly have that much money.It is also a change to the other carp that you have to do over and over again, for example the cinema.I Love this park and im really sure about coming back again to explore it more and more.Hope this review helps and makes people have a same feeling about hyde Park as me. ||July 30, 2018
Gordon S||30||Went to Hyde Park to see the Lady Di memorial Fountain which was a bit of a disappointment. However, the kids appeared to be enjoying themselves walking on the fountain. However, the park was spacious and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves either walking around or sun tanning. It was great to walk around the park and seeing everyone enjoying themselves. We enjoyed playing and feeding the budgies under a tree and seeing the Peter Pan memorial statue. Well worth a visit.||July 30, 2018
kaif331||40||We did select our hotel to be near this park.We always do enjoy the walking in the park.Siting near the lake some thing you need not to miss||July 30, 2018
GregT_NZ||40||A lovely park to wander through under the shelter of the trees. A few places to stop and grab some food or drink along the way.The fountains and wildlife in the park make for nice surroundings to relax in.||July 29, 2018
momof4traveling||50||My kids (aged 5, 8, 10, and 12), LOVED this park. We visited every single day during our week in London, and they never got tired of being there. They especially enjoyed the Diana Memorial playground and fountain, as well as feeding apples and peanuts to the parakeets that you can find throughout the park (but mostly near the Serpentine). There's a lovely merry-go-round, too (2.50gbp per ride in July 2018).||July 29, 2018
Abi261094||40||Hyde Park is beautiful place to visit at all times of the year. Long walks through the park & various events on at different times of the year. Winter wonderland being a must visit! There is also a lovely cafe right on the water in the park & not a long walk from Buckingham Palace, green park & the must visit Harrods! ||July 29, 2018
Alan253||40||You don’t always have such a large park in Major cities around the world, Hyde Park is an exception. Beautifully kept, Always a pleasure to walk thru in the Summer Months, Great place to sit and relax and watch the World go by.||July 29, 2018

Y S||50||W had an early morning walk in the park from 06:30 it was just great, with live music from all the birds in the park.||July 29, 2018
flcIII||40||My favorite part of Hyde Park is "Speakers' Corner" (located near the Marble Arch at the top of Oxford Street). Come here around midday on any Sunday and hear many different views expressed in many different ways (on other days you will probably not find much happening). The Memorial to Princess Dianna is interesting if only because of its unique and very much understated design (it's built into the ground, so it can be a little hard to locate).||July 29, 2018
Jktchorne||50||The park is very big and hard to see all of it. Very beautiful and relaxing. We enjoyed the rose garden. My kids loved Princess Diana’s memorial park. We rented bikes for them ride around. It great spot to relax and people watch. ||July 29, 2018
Leximillion||40||Hyde Park is iconic and it is very centrally located if walking around Oxford Street has worn you out. While it is not as picturesque or wild as Richmond Park, it is worth checking out for a bit of respite from the hustle and bustle. You can ride a bike, roller blade or walk and you will also see people on horseback. The park leads westward to Kensington Gardens which is a nice way to explore that part of London. No deer, but plenty of squirrels and birds.||July 29, 2018
D7323MOpatrickl||30||It was a nice day to walk in the park. We saw a marriage proposal, bikes, statues, and plenty of people hanging out. Unfortunately the grass was dead and there was litter around...||July 28, 2018
justalittlelife||50||We love Hyde Park, it’s a great space to catch your breath & find some peace amongst the hustle & bustle of the city. The Serpentine cafe by the lake is great & has plenty of options to eat & drink from Handmade pizza to coffee & cake or sandwiches to takeaway & eat in the Park. A little pricey but it’s central London....||July 28, 2018
MonicaC5478||50||Being in London, a must go! Hyde park, one of my favorite, offers so many beautiful views no matter the season you travel. I strongly recommend it!||July 28, 2018
benjidog1||40||we strolled through Hyde Park and along the serpintine. there were plenty of benches to sit on in and out of the shade. lots of grass areas for sitting, picnics and sunbathing.the only thing missing were the signposts to show us which was to go. my mum remembered that they had them last summer and they were helpful as it is quite easy to get disorientated in the park especially if you are only visiting London.||July 28, 2018
Traveling G||50||The walk is a steep in nature. Beautiful trees, birds and quiet. The park is clean, no litter and safe. ||July 28, 2018
Jan B||40||Although rather sunburnt Hyde Park is still a wonderful place to sit or stroll through. To sit on a bench and have the cute squirrels come visit is awesome.||July 28, 2018
Gamal_Mik||50||You can’t go to London without going to the Hyde Park, even if you’re a repeater.The typical picnic is a great way to relax, maybe after the tiring shopping tour at Oxford street. But you can also do more active things and enjoy a nice piece of nature in the heart of London. These include long walks, jogging or even pedaling on the lake. My daughter enjoyed very much feeding the parrots (see photo)||July 28, 2018
Wanderer039||30||We took the overcrowded, boiling hot tube to Hyde Park Corner and strolled into Hyde Park on a hot evening. The place was seething with people, many with children in tow. The food at the Serpentine was ridiculously expensive for a mediocre meal, sitting at a dirty picnic table. Not my idea of a quiet evening in the park.||July 28, 2018
mamta1511||50||Nothing can beat a morning walk or jog and relish freshly squeezed orange juice with scrambled egg with spinach and brown toast for breakfast at the restaurant by the lake side in the Hyde park .The best place ever to fill in your lungs with loads of oxygen and start your day!!||July 27, 2018
Brad A||50||Really big park. Rent a bicycle and spend some time riding around the whole park. Lots to see inside. ||July 27, 2018

364vanessac||50||This park is excellent, it is huge. Loved the lake and the serpentine restaurant. Very busy place but still managed to find seating and your own bit of space. Art work piece on the lake looked an eye sore but I suppose that’s a matter of taste. Lovely plants and trees ||July 26, 2018
Reviewer2987||50||Especially with this summer's hot weather, this is the place to be. Although it may get really busy, it is one of the best places to have a lovely stroll or just to sit and relax with the family. It's a must go!||July 26, 2018
Debbie C||40||Spent the day on a walking tour of London and strolled through Hyde Park. Very pretty gardens and lots of statues to look at. Nice walking paths that are shaded and lots of spots to sit and rest along the way.||July 26, 2018
persianrocks||50||It always amazes me that Hyde Park isn't busier. So much to do apart from walking, there's horseriding, rollerblading, boats on the Serpentine, Art to look at, a cafe designed by famous Architect Zaha Hadid and a restaurant too. ||July 26, 2018
zziv2000||40||We walked via Hyde park for Oxford street several times. Every time it was nice. But since there is a heat spill all the grass is yellow. We missed the green grass. ||July 26, 2018
colcat17||30||All of London came out on this warm and sunny Bank holidayto soak in the sun and take a stroll through the park. This is such a large and busy park, I did not feel relaxed asI maneuvered through the green space. This is certainly a popular spot, I appreciated the park though not my favorite.  ||July 26, 2018

DanielL2463||50||More picturesque than I could have imagined. Amazing to step away from the hustle and bustle of the London and into park. ||July 25, 2018
michellengary||50||We were there on several occasions. We rented deck chairs and people watched, visited the Diana memorial, Peter Pan Statue, had refreshing lemonade at the lakeside cafe, saw the Albert memorial, the Italian gardens, and speaker's corner. Lovely views, relaxing and peaceful.||July 25, 2018
DonMcS||50||Loved spending the day at this park. We rented bikes from one of the nearby stands, and pedalled the length of the park. Beautiful gardens, and so many birds. We also saw a couple of the Indian Ringneck parakeets who now call the park home, which was fun. ||July 25, 2018

nicethingsinlife||50||Another great example of open public space, well-utilised by many - tourists and residences alike. Cycling paths, gardens and many children's activities - not to mention the ducks, swans and geese!||July 24, 2018
MelOzzy||50||Hyde Park is very famous park at London.There are too many people sitting around.Always a lots of festivalsAnd you can see a small see..||July 24, 2018
chiangmaicharlies||40||Hyde Park certainly deserves an excellent rating, there is so much to see and do there. But it badly suffers from a lack of toilets and good signage. Also, many of the things for sale there (mainly snacks and drink) are overpriced and often of inferior quality.Having said that, I would recommend that you give it a try. It's huge, so don't try and do too much the first time you visit.On this visit, we walked the length of the park, but mainly went to see 'The London Mastaba', a 20 metre high sculpture floating on the Serpentine Lake,It is based on the trapezoid shapes of mastaba, an Arabic word for Egyptian tombs and seats in ancient MesopotamiaThe London Mastaba is made of 7,506 painted barrels secured to scaffolding and anchored in the lake and is free to view by all. It certainly dominates the Serpentine.Note that the artist, 'Christo' is to build a 170-metre version outside of Abu Dhabi!||July 24, 2018
Annefrid76||50||We always make time to walk in Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, when in London. We've been there year round and even in mid January you enjoy walking in the park and stop for coffee break or two. Last visit was in June. Summer heat and sun chairs out, just perfect for a chillax. ||July 24, 2018
Christopher H||50||Hyde Park is a wonderful park with great scenery and a quiet comfortable setting. Ducks abound throughout the park and swim feverishly on the picturese ponds. The park boarders Buckingham Palace and provides a tremendous background.||July 23, 2018
Nedelakttraveler||50||We walked the park on our 3rd day in London, and so glad we did. This wonderful green/calm space I the middle of London. The water and birds (who don't move no matter how close you come) were wonderful. Finding Princess Diana's tribute fountain another bonus. ||July 23, 2018

Kerstin1301||30||The park itself is quite nice, very big and famous. I have seen smaller parks I liked more in London but I guess that is only a matter of taste. The restaurant I would not recommend as the quality is not that great. ||July 23, 2018

206martim||50||My husband and son and I were visiting from the states and staying in a hotel across from Hyde Park. We thoroughly enjoyed strolling through the park and people watching. There were numerous people speaking at Speakers Row and lots of people walking, running and riding their bikes. All the statues and monuments were well taken care of and everyone was doing their own thing. It was a neat experience. ||July 22, 2018
LauraSaraceni||40||Just been with our little girls for the first time. It’s a very beautiful park, but I would appreciate a children dedicated area to play and explore nature. Still, it a nice place to visit. ||July 22, 2018
aiazotti||50||one of the most beautiful places in London. just have your walk or hire a deckchair overviewing the mini lake or enjoy your drink by the lake. in winter you enjoy the winter wonderland.||July 22, 2018

703stuartt||50||London is so lucky to have such a wonderful space, safe, well policed, and well maintained, a jewel in the crown of parks in London. I think if they had an open swimming section, with supervision would be even better in the summer months. Not far from Harrods, and other parts of central London.||July 22, 2018
Yazeed777||50||A large park with a great touristic location. People can ride horses, rent a bike, swim and rent a paddling boat. There are many coffee shops and snaks kiosk.||July 22, 2018

Gabrielle A||40||My friend and I have been lucky enough to see Carole King 2 years ago and were really looking forwards to James Taylor this year. A great atmosphere and fantastic weather! Well organised food, drink and proper loos!James Taylor didn't fail to deliver - great set!Paul Simon, we felt was a bit disappointing. Sand too many unknown songs which was a disappointment especially as it was a farewell concert. Never mind, can't win them all. We do wonder why, 4 people paid good money to talk loudly all through Paul Simon's set? Did rather spoil it for all of us surrounding them. Only question I have for the organizers is, when we last came (2 years ago) we had access to an area almost in front of the stage. This time we had no separate access and therefore paid to come in an hour earlier, but achieved nothing to our advantage for it. Won't be buying those again.Otherwise a great day out with great music.||July 22, 2018
gitah a||40||You can almost get lost in this park, it is very large...but it also has a water body and it is a great place for a walk or just sit and relax.||July 21, 2018
dmodernmarcopolo||50||We love going to Hyde Park, there is always so much to do, nice walks great picnic areas, the serpentine river, bars restaurants and pubs to relax in. Basically there is something for most people||July 21, 2018
latentinger||50||My friends and I are visiting from the States and this was a beautiful place to stroll through! We loved every bit of it||July 21, 2018
ScampinIzzy||40||The grass is very brown at present which detracts slight from the normal view of the park. There is plenty of shade and nice walks as you make your way down the Mall, better than walking on the wide paths on either side.||July 21, 2018
drizztl||40||Was here a couple of times during my stay in London. The place is really huge and there is quite a few nice places to see including the lake which I liked the most there. There are also some parts that looked like a savannah which was quite surprising. All in all a great way to get away from the city noise.||July 21, 2018
hannahsodyssey||40||Hyde park is a nice place to get a dose of greenery in London. It’s big and interesting to walk around and discover different parts of it. Some the things I particularly liked was seeing Kensington palace, the Princess Diana Memorial fountain and the NZ memorial (although that last one maybe because I’m a Kiwi). Some parts of it are a bit boring, there’s quite a lot of just grass and trees, but I guess that’s part of the charm. ||July 20, 2018
tasdebbie||40||Great place to spend a few hours, so much to see or just lay on the grass and watch the world go by. Lovely place for kids too, so much area for them to play. So close to the centre of London, bring a picnic , walk or just sit in the sun, along with loads of other people.||July 20, 2018
N T||50||This park has so much to see! It's beautifully kept,very inviting and peaceful. There's something for everyone in this park. ||July 20, 2018
Jennifer B||50||Absolutely huge is this park with plenty of walks and places to picnic and sit. Lots and lots of room for kids to run about in. Hard to believe this exists in central london. Amazing.||July 20, 2018
FTichy||40||We went to Hyde Park after Buckingham Palace, a nice walk.The Park is really nice. There are lots of great places for beautiful pictures.There is a big lake and it is great to have lunch overlooking the lake.There are a few food places there (nothing fancy), but perfect for a Park.You can spend an entire day walking around it, or just walk through it, it depends on your schedule and interests.It is a really beautiful place to visit.No entrance fees.||July 20, 2018
Mandy L||20||I attended with my sister, we paid £490 each for our Ultimate bar With Diamond view tickets, should have been a perfect day. Events occurred with two other parties in our surrounding area, (none of which we knew) that led to security moving us aggressively from the place we'd be standing all day.And when we protested threatened to eject us from the event. So by the time Bublé had come on. Our Diamond View was probably a worse view than people who had paid general entry. If you intend to get the ultimate bar experience do not waste your money on diamond view. And if you book Diamond view be prepared not to move all day. I'm gutted I spent money I couldn't really afford for this, but thought it would be a treasured memory, turned out to be one of the worst days of my life.||July 20, 2018
auntylane||20||We were at the British Summer Time Festival on Sunday to watch Paul Simon and James Taylor. The age of these superb artists and how long they have been around would be a good indicator of the age group of the audience but yet again we in Britian are treated badly in Hyde Park. There was not a single seat to be found ( and no chairs allowed in ) The weather had also been widely forcast for many days before that it would be in excess of 31c but yet again no shelter provided at all. It was an endurance - standing or sitting when possible on rock hard ground for over 10 hours is no fun. And then to add insult to injury you are not allowed to take food in and are forced to pay £8 for hot dog - rip off Britain. Last time I will be going to a Hyde Park event.||July 20, 2018
Excursion524504||50||This is a spectacular park in the middle of London. We enjoyed walking through the park during our vacation. For birders, there is a wide variety of birds that can be seen in the park. ||July 20, 2018
beaner2436||50||Visited for concerts and charity events always clean and full of lovely people and views making it a chilled experience and cultural too.||July 19, 2018
vonifide||40||A great place to stroll, and a shortcut through the city. I went specifically to visit the Rose Garden in the southeast corner of the park. In mid-late May, many of the roses were blooming wonderfully. The garden beds were planted with a mixture of perennials and the roses and other shrubs and some small trees. Excellent in the late afternoon.||July 19, 2018
Anastasiadempsey||50||Me and my friend stayed the weekend in London, and we stupidly booked a 9pm train which was draining as we were exhausted from the night before. However, after feeling hungover we brought some food with us, and sat on a bench at the park and stared at the ducks, including the beautiful swans. It was a lovely view and even better when hungover, it’s so beautiful and natural. Hyde Park is also used for festivals in London, and located in a great location in central London. ||July 19, 2018
BenBriggs||50||Beautiful contrast between the serenity of the Serpentine and the marginal planting with the electric colours of the Mastaba that Christo and Jeanne-Claude have installed - their first in London. See it and admire.||July 18, 2018
Heike1201||50||Wonderful open space in the centre of the city - the Serpentine Lake is great to wander around, not only now with Christo's "The Mastaba". There is also a public swimming pool with paid entrance - looks nice but we didn't visit.||July 18, 2018
AbhishekS4354||50||Well i went with the thought that it would be any other of moderate size.. but oh my goodness it is so huge to say the least..I would suggest best time to go would be morning time till the noon., spending time near the lake.. watching the the water ducks and getting the sun..There are many gates.. if you are a visitor keep track of the nearest exit near you.. not necessary you need to come back all the way to same entrance..(this mistake I did) ..||July 18, 2018
TheMartins1997||50||This beautiful park is so much bigger than I thought- we spent a lovely, leisurely afternoon walking around Hyde Park finding out what it had to offer. Be prepared to walk a fair distance to see all the areas within the park. Plenty of places to refuel & rest your tired feet. The Diana, Princess of Wales memorial fountain was especially nice- not just for the fountain itself but also for the fact that you could dip your feet in the cool water. Was lovely to see families enjoying this lovely space within the park. We didn’t get to see all that the park has to offer but really enjoyed what we did see. ||July 18, 2018
josz134||40||Great and large park with speakers corner.A park with quiet spots, concerts, nature and art. Currently an artwork of Christo is in the pond.||July 18, 2018
HarryHSR||50||this is a huge park, located in Kensington ... you wont be able to see the complete park in 2 hours, very well maintained with beautiful fountains, flora & fauna :)||July 18, 2018
amitkapur70||30||Nice place, pleasing to eye , too big to cover in a day, recommended short visit for 2 hours or so, located centrally in london and has a metro station nearby||July 17, 2018
roxyjeff27||40||Peaceful and beautifull. Lots of birdlife,squirrels and people with dogs. Quite large. Allow a few hours to explore||July 17, 2018
Gakeitse||40||I strolled from Green Park to the Albert Memorial on my way to the Albert Memorial and the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall on a beautiful, sunny evening. I photographed points of interest en route (see attached). It was busy but balmy and lots of people were out. enjoying the ambience it afforded. London's beautiful.||July 17, 2018
ladylime||50||If you think that Hyde Park is a little old park with a small green area and a few trees you will be much mistaken. This is a huge are and accessed from many places. Do not plan to meet someone where unless you know exactly where you are going you will have a very interesting and long walk but you still may not find them. Read about the park, look at a map, plan what you might all want to do. There is so much you will all be going in different directions. If it is warm but not too hot get a picnic together read what the tourist information says and head to the nearest access to you but expect to spend a long walk as Hyde Park has a way of drawing you in deeper and deeper to the Serpentine, to the statue of Peter Pan to the trees to the art gallery and then you will wonder where you are! There is usually a bus stop near by, not always a tube quite so close and in doubt always plan to hail a taxi or sit in a hotel or bar and take stock of how to get home for by then you will be tired and still have missed much of the park!||July 17, 2018
Jill W||50||BST Hyde Park even in the rain we still had an amazing day watching in brilliant sunshine during the day before the rain came and Michael Buble but he was brilliant||July 17, 2018
ZoeF754||40||I had a fantastic day in Hyde Park watching Bruno Mars and all the other acts at British Summer Time on Saturday 14th July. There was excellent facilities throughout the park as well as a wide selection of food and drink. The sun was shining, the company excellent and the music was fantastic what more can you ask for?||July 17, 2018
reggio1623||40||My wife and I and friends attended the last of this years Barclaycard BST concerts , there was another review which stated that the reviewer had followed the t ‘s & c’s and brought nothing more than a hat and purse , we had done the same only find many of our fellow concert goers had not , one guy and I wished I’d got a photo had a kettle and one of those whippy little gas hobs !! It would appear that not all bag searches were the same we saw brollies rugs fishing stools etc so well done to those who fought the system !! The music IMHO was ten star throughout the day with a special note for a duo called Ward Thomas and of course the feature acts were outstanding , my only other negative was the state that some of our fellow festival goers were in especially the four posh boys near to us who had either had been on the Colombian marching powder before coming into the park or had ingested said powder whilst in the Park see previous comments about bag searches . These four “ gents “ were babbling throughout Paul Simon ‘s entire set until a chippy little Aussie guy told them to either shut the **** up or move away ( cue round of applause from others in vicinity ) they moved !! I guess my main point is that the searches were not thorough or consistent enough , but it won’t stop me from coming next whoever may be performing.||July 17, 2018
peter r||50||Went on Friday for Micheal Buble.Excellent set up. Great choices of food and drink.Prices not over the top.Great supporting line up.A great day despite the rain as Van Morrison finished his set.Micheal Buble superb as always.Would have no qualms about visiting again.||July 17, 2018
pjgrad||40||This was a lovely, giant park. We sat and watched people boating and the swans while having a drink. It's a bit smelly right by the water due to the fowl poo. The temporary art piece in the water was interesting. One the one hand I liked the idea of the monolith rising from the water but the color was so jarring. ||July 17, 2018
cazd53||50||We only saw a bit while we were waiting for a gig at the British Summertime event but it's a fab place. The temporary barrels sculpture is impressive. I'll be back to spend longer later in the summer||July 17, 2018
Prokop T||50||This enormous park is the best hang-out spot in all of London and is a must visit for each visitor. Walking around, feeding ducks or just relaxing with a book under local oak trees is an experience. Also, Hyde Park is definitely the best place to go running in Central London if you pursue a healthy lifestyle.||July 17, 2018
Freddy W||40||This is the biggest park of London. There's a lake (Serpentine Lake), where you can row or sail in the summer months, and playgrounds for the children. Perfect place to have a walk.||July 17, 2018
Pathfinder101||40||Utilising the Hop On Hop Off bus, you can take delight in a very nostalgic walk through Hyde Park to gain access to Kensington Palace. It certainly has wide open green spaces to be able to enjoy on a casual walk or to simply sit and escape the hustle and bustle of the adjacent significant city.||July 16, 2018
Jonathan S||50||It was a sunny day and I enjoyed taking a walk around the park and lake.It nice place to visit on a warm day.||July 16, 2018
BAZANG||50||We went on a very hot day but do not be fooled by the weather .We encountered a Thunderstorm before the Headline act came on . BST in The Park is not cheap for food oulets and drinks unforturanty you cannot bring you. Great Concert venue and atmospherer||July 16, 2018
potter75_11||40||A great day out, excellent venue, well run with helpful staff. Glorious weather all day, apart from just as Van Morrison finished the heavens opened and we were all drenched from a typical torrential British summer thunderstorm. Luckily, it didn't last through Buble's entire show, but started raining again towards the end.My one complaint is that my wife and I duly read the terms and conditions of entry to Hyde Park for the show, which clearly stated no food or drink to be brought into the venue, no picnics, no blankets, no chairs, no umbrellas etc. etc. However, it seems we were the only ones who had either read or obeyed the terms and conditions. We turned up with minimal belongings, only to find that just about everyone else had brought in exactly what they wanted to! People had brought their own alcohol, picnics, chairs etc. in and they were obviously not stopped at all.This didn't make any difference to our day and enjoyment of the show, but it is extremely annoying when, having obeyed the terms and conditions, we found that we were just about the only people who had! Either there are terms and conditions to entry or there aren't, please get this sorted out!||July 16, 2018
trev h||50||Had not really done much in Hyde Park in all our other visits to London however on this occasion we spent our 3 day visit going through different parts this time. From the British Summertime concert (generally where Winter Wonderland is located) to walking much of The Serpentine to visiting Kensington Palace at the top end. Lots of things to do and visit such as the lake itself & Prince Alberts memorial to spending time with family and friends or just people watching from one of many coffee shops or you could visit an art gallery or just wander through the woods taking in all that natural provides.Wonderful space & it's beautiful plus it's free.||July 16, 2018
RobinHoodNG12||50||Walking through the park to the South Kensington museums relaxing, sunny,peaceful. Stopped for a coffee at the Lido and watched the swimmers. Strolled onto the Prince Albert Memorial watching the birds, the neat flower beds, Diana’s memorial and kids learning to play sport. London at it’s best ||July 16, 2018
Frankie R||50||This is such a lovely place to come if you are in central London. The concerts there are fantastic and really well organised. ||July 16, 2018
Aidas S||10||I was there couple time and it was good,but the last time it was very bad.Lots of ducks sh** everywhere,i love animal,birds and whats ever but you can domsomething about it i think or stop charging people then.They said is nature.Ok next,kids little swimming pool was so dirty.This is center of London one of the biggest places and i was shocked and asked refund after 10 min walk.Sorry for putting bad review but to change water and keep ducks on one side its not big deal or hire someone to clean after them.Swimming and sh** goes in a water no way man.||July 15, 2018
PaulW5401||50||I walk through Hyde Park every time I come to London. The park lets you get away from the hustle & bustle of the city. On the west side is Kensington Gardens where you'll find the stunning Kensington Palace, home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridg, William and Catherine, and now Meghan and Harry. Running through the middle of the park is The Serpentine when you can rent paddle wheelers. And on the North West corner is the famous "Speakers Corner", which leads to Marble Arch. Throughout the park are many trails that criss-cross in every direction. From Red Oak to Silver Maple; the park has a variety of trees and large open grassy areas. There are trails for walkers, other trails for cyclists, and places to walk your dog.||July 15, 2018
karleensheets||50||On a lovely day, you’ll see families and friends picnicking, playing football, sunning, listening to music, reading... etc. etc. There are many paths, beautiful water features and gardens. Also, museums, Kensington Palace, and restaurants are nearby. ||July 15, 2018
SaskatchewanViking68||50||Excellent bike pathes with a number of rental locations at different entrances to the park. We rented two bikes for 2pounds each for a 24 hr period. I think this was the most affordable item we encountered in London. There is an excellent BBQ venue along the small lake that has picnic tables and serves draft beer and apple ciders. This place offered one of the best meals we had in London and was also affordable.||July 15, 2018
bigglesStrathaven||50||Absolutely fabulous setting in the Park,lots of good food eateriesin the garden ticket area and they were for London reasonably priced,great stewarding and free water the temperature hit over 32 degree so very welcome.||July 15, 2018
R1595PCjohnt||50||Nice park, with a big lake, for lots of activities on a sunny day. Strolling, picnicking, canoeing, ride a bike (not everywhere, in some paths is not allowed) and more. Also at summer many events take place there. Recommended.||July 15, 2018
RnWP||50||Attended the British Summer Time 2018 festival in London's Hyde Park to see Michael Bublé in his return concert to the UK. A great venue, courteous helpful staff and excellent facilities and toilets were clean for hosting over 55k people. Well done all the ground staff.||July 15, 2018
TeamWard||50||BST 2018, great line-up we had tickets for Michael Buble day and were not disappointed, great venue, very well organised and an exceptional outdoor concert with weather glorious until 19:20 when the heavens opened for the last act Michael Buble, but he performed until 22:20 in the rain and was fantastic, a great day out.||July 15, 2018
Scott H||50||Huge, busy park with lots to see and do. When there's a concert going on, you can sit anywhere close and listen for free! ||July 15, 2018
OskarWarsaw||50||If you’re looking for a perfect location to get rest in the heart of London then it is the place to be. Very big park with beautiful lake and lots of cafes. You can charge your inner batteries and get back to whatever you want. ||July 15, 2018
Sjabena||50||Came here on Friday for their festival and had a brilliant time. The access was very easy and security checks were easy enough. Once inside, the amount of food and drink stalls along with other bits and pieces to get involved in, it was great! The acts on stage were also great but obviously Michael buble was the star of the show! ||July 15, 2018
brendagS4105QF||50||We strolled through the park more than once. Picturesque-families picnicking, children playing, couples walking hand in hand. Didn’t make it to Princess Diana’s memorial but still would recommend the view. Beautiful flowers and statues ||July 15, 2018

Carol A||40||I went to Hyde Park during my first trip to London and I found it to be quite beautiful. It's a nice place for a walk. It's also conveniently located in the city.||July 15, 2018
Bob G||40||This park is huge for an old git like me, but an enjoyable walk from Queens gate to west entrance of BST venue especially if you take the long way round. Great place to chill or swim or see an event. Very dry ground until 2000 hours then the heavens opened. Not pleasant if you are not prepared. Still a great day.||July 14, 2018

Walth58||50||Went to London Hyde Park for a concert and the venue and facilities are excellent. The sun was out all day but come the evening the heavens opened and there is no shelter. Make sure you check the weather forecast and go prepared. Apart from the rain we had a fantastic time ||July 14, 2018
darlenefrizzell||50||Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are great places to spend a day. Walking around, boating, seeing the fountains and Kensington Palace. Very nice. ||July 14, 2018
WendyTJr||40||Hyde Park is one of the 8 royal parks in London, also probably the most famous one. U can do jogging, biking, n also paddling in the lake in the middle of the park. There is a cafe by the lake. In sunny days, it’s nice to sit on the deck, having a pizza while seeing the beautiful swans swimming around. There is also a small kiosk selling drinks n sandwiches/wraps. We grabed a sandwich n a wrap n sodas from it and found it actually quite pricy. Anyway, it’s good to spend a 2-3 hours there just doing nothing but enjoying the sunlight.||July 14, 2018
ElmoMasey||40||We went to the British Summer time Festival on Thursday! It was absolutely lovely and perfect weather. The park itself (and the festival) were free to get in, but everything inside is VERY expensive! I'd recommend taking a picnic. The river is lovely, with lots of ducks and geese, it's lovely place to walk around and sit on the grass in the sun (you can sit under the big old oak trees for shade), it would be great to have a bit more activity areas for kids though, like a play park or something ||July 14, 2018
Tonelliandr||50||Best place for the summer, I used to go there at list 3 times a week!! A lot of activity are possible ||July 14, 2018
daveybear||10||Told no food, large bags, umbrellas, chairs, etc and all of these were clearly allowed in so all those who played by the rules felt cheated and ripped off for food. More to the point, when I went through the security check, the alarm beeped but this was ignored by the staff and when I mentioned it to them, I was told it was OK. Total joke and open house for 80000 people to be targeted. ||July 14, 2018
RhettL905||40||What a beautiful park with big lake and great running and biking trails. Worth a visit while in downtown London. ||July 14, 2018
D8TEterryh||50||For fifth year running we visited Hyde Park for open air concerts. This year, Michael Bublé headlined. The park is perfect for this location apart from cover when the unexpected shower happens. North Entrance to the park is best accessed from Marble Arch tube station whereas other entrances are better accessed from Hyde Park Corner station. Food and drink facilities at the event covered all tastes. Sound system and screens are excellent. Wi-fi was awful. When will big events get this right??||July 13, 2018
quinni_224||40||Our visit to Hyde Park was the only time during the entire six weeks on holidays with my mother and brother that I experienced real euphoria. The open air and greenery was something that I was missing during our travels, yet Hyde Park provided this for me. I was able to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and feel free.This freedom was heighten by being able to watch the squirrels scurry about and feed the pigeons.||July 13, 2018
mauriciou1970||30||Whereas Hyde Park is a large and well maintained park, it's flat with few trees and wide grass areas and hasn't city views from inside It, so is good for a sunbath or take a rest, ideal for london citizens. But for me, a tourist, I think that is enought with visit it around it, specialy if you already knows another huge and more diverse parks in other cities like Central Park in NYC or Golden Gate Park in San Francisco or another wherever.||July 13, 2018
Jeremy R||50||Got everything - fantastic park.....best in the world. Good atmosphere, lots of variety, great plants, trees, flowers; well organised, safe and just a wonderful place||July 13, 2018

kevangarratt||40||Went to Diana memorial in the Park, very nive but water was very cold. Nice to see it working and very well kept ||July 13, 2018
Auchtubh8||40||I always go to Hyde Park. It has lots of things to see and do well away from cars etc. You can do a bit of boating on the serpentine. If you are fit you can walk to Oxford street into the main shopping area. ||July 13, 2018
702khurramh||40||Hyde park is amongst the most beautiful parks in London and it lives up to its fame. We visited the park during summer but unfortunately at a time when it hadn’t rained for the last two weeks or so. The yellowish brown grass didn’t do justice to its natural setting. Beautiful trees while talking a walk around the park was very serene. I think it’s certainly a place one should visit while in London. ||July 13, 2018
plantbasedpiget||50||Went here last week as I had a few hours in London to kill and spent them sitting in Hyde Park, such a gorgeous place, as it so big it can be busy without feeling cramped. It is a great place to spend the Summer in and if you take yourself some food and drinks you could have a nice long day here without spending too much money.||July 13, 2018
Ross M||50||Just a perfect day out that flowed from 2pm to approx 10pm. I have been going for many years and is a summer Highlight. Neil Young, Carole King, The Who and now Eric Clapton, Santana and Steve Winwood....all excellent with an out there collective age that renders timeless when you see and hear these guys playing out of their skin. Having been to many festivals over the years I thought the facillities were just fine, plenty of food and booze obviously pricey and great Loos. I can only suggest dropping the contract with "Heinekin" enough said!||July 13, 2018
TimC233||50||Awesome BST Festival with Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana and Steve Windwood! Superb organization, great sound and vision, good restaurants and bars ..... no queues, except for the Merchandise which was a joke .... 45mins to buy a tee-shirt!!! ||July 13, 2018
alanamy69||50||A magnificient park located in the middle of Paddington. It has everything one could want in a public park. There is a variety of shady trees and spectacular floral gardens. Parrots can be hand fed and squirrels are an added attraction. On one side of the park is Kensington Palace close to Princess Diana's Memorial Gardens.||July 13, 2018
David R||50||Any visitor to London should set aside several hours to slowly enjoy the "park experience".There is so much to see and more importantly, to do.The park is extremely well maintained and it is a pleasure just to stroll or sit on a bench and enjoy an ice cream whilst bird watching, or to visit the art galleries. Makes a welcome break from the hard streets of the capital.||July 13, 2018
SumitD533||50||Haven't really seen such a huge garden in my whole life. I would suggest this place for cycling, siesta and picnic!||July 13, 2018
Alison F||40||The park is excellent, but it is so large, once you're ready to leave it is hard to find the exit! Definitely worth a visit, especially in the spring.||July 12, 2018
D A||50||This is one of my favourite spots in th entire world. The park is extensive, and it's surrounded by so many trees and bushes, you'll certainly forget in the middle of one of the largest cities in the world. The history of this place, Percy B. Shelley's old haunting ground, is particularly delicious (and you can sail paper boats in the Serpentine as he used to), and you definitely need to make this one of your must-visit stops - bring a picnic, or grab food nearby, and spend a few hours here.||July 12, 2018
Fae C||50||Beautiful huge gardens, especially loved the Italian fountain area.We were there for a concert and what a lovely place in central London!||July 12, 2018
Ally M||50||The park is lovely - a must see when visiting The Kensington Palace. Walk around, sit at the lake, chill - it is beautiful.||July 12, 2018
LynseyUK55||40||Very organised we have been before so knew what to expect. Although states no rucksacks people do take them in. The north entrance which is the main entrance is a fair walk from hyde park tube but doesn't take long to get inside. Given the weather it was a very hot day this year however we came prepared. Free water so just needed to refill the bottle. A pint of cider was 6 pound and 9 pound for a meal which is expensive but not surprising for these events. The sound on this occasion wasn't the best but we got to see Eric Clapton Steve winwood and Santana so good value for the band's. I will continue to go as long as there is a band I want to see. Lovely surroundings and a very enjoyable day!!!!||July 12, 2018
shenn09||50||We loved this place, feeding birds, wading in the Diana memorial and serene. Lovely place for a picnic or to cycle in||July 12, 2018
katelynbooth||50||Attended the Cure concert at Hyde Park while on our honeymoon. We have been to a LOT of festivals in the states for all sorts of musical genres but this was by far the most organized we’ve ever attended. Prices were decent and there was such a variety in food and drink offered. The park itself is HUGE and clean, we saw lots of people relaxing and enjoying their day out in the park before getting to the festival gated area. Lots of shops nearby to grab food and drinks to bring to the park for a picnic! Can’t speak to how the park normally is when not set up for the concert but I can say that we enjoyed time lying around in the shade in various areas before the show and seeing sculptures throughout the park. ||July 12, 2018

Great screens so everyone got a great view. No problems everyone friendly and having a good time. I'd recommend it for all ages there's music for all ages over the 10 days it's on. Easy to get to from all transport. Public transport easier cos you don't need to park and pay a bomb.||July 12, 2018
Sally C||10||We went to see Eric Clapton, Santana & others on Sunday 8 July 2018. Nearly died of sunstroke - no shade nor ability to bring your own. Ground rock hard and we were ordered to take up any picnic blankets etc. Water provided but that was all. In view of forecast very hot weather this was shameful, especially as we had paid £130 each for tickets. If you left your place to try to seek respite you would not get back. The screens were not properly visible from many places - could have been higher up so people who had paid a lot of money could see. My husband has Parkinsons and was really suffering from lack of shade (even temporary) as was I. We left about 5.30 (5 more hours to go!) as did many others. Don't even think of attending another event like this if you value your health & well-being. We are very surprised that this sort of event is permitted where cattle in trucks are better cared for. It brings a bad name on such an otherwise lovely park.||July 11, 2018
zeppgirl||50||I wanted to see the speakers corner and visit the Princess Diana playground. The speakers corner was ok. I think it would have been better without my younger kids, and in that case I would have actually stopped to listen to what the people had to say. They couldn't care and it was just crowded, so we walked to the playground. It was a 20 minute walk at a brisk pace, which gives you an idea of how big this park is. Even with this, we were not at the end of the park.The playground was a lot of fun. There are some cool activities- my favorite was the musical section, where there are some toys like xylophones and whatnot that the kids can play with to make music. They had fun.||July 11, 2018

Dgn1010||50||We walked around the beautiful Hyde Park at a leisurely pace and took it all in. Lovely trees, lots of greenery, statues, river... just nice away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Princess Diana Memorial Fountain is nice for relaxing beside. Lots of people so great for people watching too!||July 11, 2018

IvanaM2363||50||Hyde Park is lovely mainly on a nice sunny day. You can do cycling, jogging, exercising , etc. there while being surrounded by a beautiful nature and animals. However sometimes you get to see dead rat floating on the water, but the beautiful scenery of Hyde Park exceeds that and you will soon forget it. You also can get something to eat there and so to enjoy a lovely day out with your friends or family.||July 11, 2018

Aziz H||40||Being close enough to my work place, I tend to go for a run here every so often and it is a nice contrast to the seemingly never ending tiredness of the west end. It is not over run by tourists and can be used as a peaceful time to one's self or even a family day out.||July 11, 2018
Bernice D||40||Most days when in London we meander through this park enormous, absolutely, beautiful, completely, busy, very, especially on a warm summer day, flowers and trees in bloom, lawns immaculate and very green, and even a woodland area so the squirrels feel at home||July 10, 2018

teach1211||50||We had one day in London on this trip before heading out on a cruise. We spent our day walking around Hyde Park and visiting Kensington. My husband, a huge history buff, wanted to visit a few of the memorials in the park. We enjoyed walking around the park on a beautiful day. We did want to visit a few memorials not shown on the maps which was like finding a needle in a haystack since the park is huge! Luckily we spotted them all before giving up on the search. Definitely worth a visit especially on a nice day.||July 10, 2018
harryw2607||40||Wandered around Hyde Park on a hot day to keep cool rather than stay in the city. Loads of people walking about in the sunshine, buying ice-creams and drinks, taking photographs of the multitude of wildlife on the river which were always being fed by the many tourists.||July 10, 2018

curtis69||50||the 2018 Hyde park concert was a super event! never again those three superstars of music will be seen together at one time. Steve was out of this world and considered by me the best act this evening, I felt back in 1965 so refreshing authentic his music. Carlos tried to please the hip hop generation, wish he would have played more slow, bluesy tunes. Eric as usual out of this world, thouhg he changed the set list a bit, missed white room and Doyle Bramhall came very close to Eric's solis||July 10, 2018
PRAMMRBM||50||Great buzz and busy at Lido area. Managed to get a table at the lido cafe where we had great sandwiches and a well needed cool drink. Cafe was very busy and finding a table was tricky. Lido has swimming which we didn't know about and in the 30 degree heat would have been handy if we had brought a towel and costumes. Great place to sit and people watch so would definitely recommend hiring some deck chairs in the shade with views over the water. We hired 3 chairs for an hour which was roughly £5 but would have been better value to hire them for longer. Great relaxing day however as the park is huge there is the option to go for a long walk too! ||July 10, 2018
g0ingn0wheresl0wly||50||Well organised Well presented Great day out and will definitely go back next year. had some extra time and walked around the park. This is a must for anyone visiting London. Excellent park very well maintained.||July 9, 2018
Adam H||50||Hyde Park as a music venue continues to delight - whatever your taste in music.For me, The Cure's 40th Anniversary was dazzling; personally - my 38th Anniversary, having first seen The Cure play live in 1980 -Seventeen Seconds tour (?) and seeing The Cure play "Route of Kings" again @ Hyde Park many years later...Great venue - huge and yet intimate.Sir Bob - now 59 years young - and the boys continue to perform beyond belief.Epic encore was a medley of their first album - having nailed the "pop songs" they are also known for earlier, with a huge 65 thousand sell out crowd singing along - closing with 10:15 and Killing an Arab ( based on 1940's book, L'Etranger book by French author Albert Camus) was just the azimuth.Hyde Park - great venue!The Cure - unforgettable 5 star performance!Audience ranged from Grandad High Court Judges to pre-teen kids!Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight!||July 9, 2018
Robert T||50||I attended an open air concert at Hyde Park. The facilities inside were first class. The waiting time for food and drinks was very fast and the amenities were excellent. There were plenty of areas to keep hydrated and even a small pharmacy to get sun tan lotion etc. Overall a great facility and worth visiting for any open air concert. Bear in mind we had excellent weather that was certainly a bonus.||July 9, 2018
anagnclvs||30||I have lived in London for quite a while and been in Hyde Park multiple times. I think it’s a great place if you wanna go with family and friends. I personally don’t think the park is that beautiful... I prefer Regent’s Park in terms of beauty and nature. If you’re visiting London you should visit both. ||July 9, 2018
mariajellicoe||50||Lovely to walk in the park any time of the year but quite brilliant with clear blue skies and trees in their green glory. This particular time we took a boat on the Serpentine which gave us good views on all sides. Quite steep though at £40 but it was a treat.||July 9, 2018
Alain G||50||I recently went to an event which was inside Hyde Park. It truly is a wonderful place with large open spaces and Londoners are very lucky to be able to have such a green area situated in the centre of London. Plenty of trees to lie under and beautiful parkland to walk around and savour and also enjoy. This is a true haven and if you are visiting on Sunday go to Speakers Corner and listen to lively conversations and if you are brave enough join in. I hope you get the chance to visit Hyde Park and if the weather is good you will have visited a real gem at its best.||July 9, 2018
lindiloo21||10||Where to start? Well the first disappointment was the poor selection of drinks at the bar with the hum drum choice of Fosters and Strongbow, we were told in advance that they wanted to make it a cash free event and all the staff had t-shirts with contactless is quicker, apart from when we went to pay for our drinks and were told it was cash only, as the card machines weren't working!! Then the worst part of this money making scam of an event, they block of the first third of the arena and only allow access to those who could afford to pay more! Well I was appalled, it's bad enough that they provide the rich with their own grandstand with parasols, while the rest were desperately searching for shade in 32 degrees, only to be moved off by security. Then we decided to get some food before The Cure came on and had to queue at the vegan food stand to order, then join another queue to wait to collect the food, I ordered a couscous and hummus salad. It turned out to be a spoon of couscous and hummus and a few leaves of lettuce for £8. I did enjoy seeing the band, although from a distance, shame on you Barclaycard||July 9, 2018

Linda D||50||I was fortunate to have the pleasure of visiting Hyde Park for the Eric Clapton concert. Wow is all I can say. Great security and limited queuing to get in. Food and drink set up absolutely fantastic with so much choice and no queues due to amount of vendors. Tables near food areas so you could have a seat to eat your food. Yes more expensive than home town but well worth it. Great atmosphere and most importantly lots of toilets which were being cleaned regularly and no queuing. Pleasantly surprised. Had a fantastic day and hats off to the organisers and top marks for everything. Very well organised. Definitely be back next year.||July 9, 2018
WalkingInLA||50||Walked it from Hyde Park Corner and back. Ice cream available from vendors near snack bar. Our day, Eric Clapton was playing, and you could hear the fantastic concert without paying the 200 pound ticket. Families relaxing on the ground. Not much grass due to the recent drought.

Steetwise||50||Hyde Park is smaller than Central Park New York at only 350 acres excluding Kensington Gardens. Established in 1536 by Henry VIII as a hunting ground for himself, the land was taken from Westminster Abbey.For the jogger, it is about 4.3 miles of running paths through glorious pathways littered with huge well established trees, the Serpentine lake at which you can hire boats to wile away the time floating gently on water in the centre of London or picnic on the banks watching the swans and ducks. They will be looking for food so do not be tempted too much.Speaker's corner has been established as a point of free speech and debate since 1872.Large concerts of all types and styles of music is common with crowds often reaching in excess of 100,000 plus.There are numerous sporting facilities including football pitches, cycle paths,tennis courts and of course horse riding, a very popular activity.Step into the heart of London and enjoy.||July 9, 2018

TanjungBaraDiver||40||We got lucky with this trip and had warm, sunny weather the whole time. Hyde Park was perfect for a walk, checking out the lake, swans, ducks etc. and even squirrels. Walkways are everywhere and it's a little easy to get lost, despite signposts we didn't manage to find the Diana Memorial Garden. But the floral arrangements were amazing and the big open parkland in the middle of the city is great.||July 9, 2018

Nicholas H||50||What a perfect setting for a feast of guitar music, amid the acres of peace and quiet of Hyde Park. I wandered through the parched landscape of this wonderful haven of peace and quiet in the very heart of London and marvelled at what a great public facility this is, with the Serpentine lake the glittering jewel at its heart. The festival grounds are well organised, with excellent areas for spectators to get a variety of food and drinks. The festival was amazing: Willie Nelson's son, Lukas, Gary Clarke Jr, Steve Winwood, Carlos Santana and finally of course, Eric Clapton. An absolute feast of guitar music. Leaving at the end was surprisingly efficient. Despite a crowd of some 60,000 I was clear of the site within about 15 minutes. Plenty of public transport serves the park.||July 8, 2018
964AnneM964||50||We spent an entire morning walking through Hyde Park. I believe the secret is to get there early in summer, most of the attractions in London (Princess Diana Memorial) only open at 10:00. Any time before that the park is quiet and you will encounter joggers, cyclists and people going to work. Hyde park is a big park, around 2 - 3 miles in length. Give yourself enough time to walk through the different sections. We started at Speakers Corner and zig zagged across to Kensington Palace. There are plenty of coffee kiosks dotted around the park, along with drinking fountains and good restroom facilities (20p entrance). We loved our leisurely morning spent in the Park in the midst of the London hustle and bustle.||July 8, 2018

It so pleasant it will undoubtedly make you smile.Check the website for Summer activities (tons), in the Fall you'll be content just by taking in all the colours of the season and during Winter, you cannot miss the Winter Wonderland festival.||July 8, 2018

We walked through the park to visit Kensington Palace, then later, as a shortcut back to our hotel from Royal Albert Hall.||July 8, 2018
Natalie B||50||Beautiful! Lots of hidden gems. Closes at dusk. We got some really nice pictures at about 10:00pm. It feels like it goes on and on. Peter Pan statue is also located here.

We also had a burger at the food court area that was quite tasty.||July 7, 2018

HenaTravel||50||This park is lovely, huge and with plenty to experience as well. I recommend trying the pedal boats (book at least an hour, 30mins is not enough time), visiting the restaurant next to the lake, walking all around the park, seeing the statues, walking to Kensington Gardens which is just separated by one road.On Sundays see the Speakers Corner bustling with people.A very nice big park.||July 7, 2018
fishinwater||40||This is a great experience. You can’t ride a bike on all the trails as there are designated walking areas only but you can circumnavigate the park pretty well on a bike. This is a nice location to get away from the hustle of the city. Well worth a visit. ||July 6, 2018
itsbest||20||Lots of ground to cover so bikes are ideal you can get a rental at either end of the park and it is much more comfortable to cover the grounds. Many teenagers and grown ups drinking liquor and humping each other in the evening so if with kids I’d suggest visiting earlier in the day. Park officials could use a pointer and stop quite a bit of this obscene behaviour||July 6, 2018
inorbi||50||Not far from the Peter Pan statue you find tons of perroquets. Yes, the park is nice, and the authorities don't advise to feed the perroquets, but if you are with children, this is going to be one of the highlights of their visit...||July 6, 2018
f-foerl||50||Hyde Park is perfect for a stroll and jogging. We where lucky enough to have the parks entrance next to our hotel, which made it possible for us to walk through the park when going to sights, rather than going underground.It might not be amongst the best looking parks in the world, but it’s definitely a nice grasp of freshness and a green lung in the city. Even a place to “hide away” and think.Recommend!||July 6, 2018

r0savelj||50||Big beautiful park! We were staying two blocks away from Hyde park and walked there almost everyday. There is a lake with swans and ducks, Kensington palace is just across that lake. In the morning you get to see the royal guard practicing with their horses. It’s a nice walk and you can visit some tourist and local attractions there. Also a good place to exercise, run or walk :)||July 5, 2018
Fearless756862||40||Most locals don't have yards so you'll see many of them lying on blankets to sunbathe or picnic. It's an enormous park with places to buy ice cream and water and food. There are also paddle boat rentals, the Memorial to Princess Diana, Kensington Palace and horse stables. Our hotel was across the street so we got to explore a bit. Lovely!||July 5, 2018
GreetingsfromIdaho20||50||Hyde Park is a great place to walk. It is a way to get away from the busy city without leaving London. The park was near our hotel, Grosvenor Hotel on Buckingham Road. There are nice shops to pick up souvenirs or duck food and restaurants. ||July 5, 2018

juliemS832RC||40||This beaupark in the centre of London is a great place to catch up on some sun, hang out with the family and stroll through nature in the city.....but don't you dare sit in a deck chair. Lots and lots of deck chairs all over the place and each set is patrolled by a fierce and poorly skilled chair guy. Their signage is poorly placed...probably to make sure people don't see it... then once a hapless tourist sat down they pounced. Declaring said tourist owed them money and demanding it then and there. As we walked around the park we saw it happen again and again. The only mar on a lovely time in the park.||July 4, 2018

issa81||50||This is probably the most famous London park and for a reason!I like strolling in it along the Serpentine. You can always rent a pedal boat, hit the cafe and restaurants, or simply rent a chair and sit and watch the birds.The park is also close to Kensington palace and other major London landmarks.Highly recommended!||July 3, 2018
Ruth G||40||It’s startling to step out of a busy part of the city and into the ambiance of this famous park. The centerpiece of the bucolic area is the Serpentine, a long narrow stretch of water filled with swans, ducks, geese, and a few coots. We even saw a heron. There’s a little café at one end where you can buy burgers and other simple food. At the other end was an art installation by Christo and his wife made out of colorfully painted beer barrels. To me it took away from the old world atmosphere of the surroundings. You can walk around the lake, and there are other walking paths throughout the park.||July 3, 2018
Birtrum_13||40||This park is world famous and lives up to its billing, its very large and provides a lot of walking excerise for those so inclined. There are also rental bikes which are a good value.B Niagara Canada||July 3, 2018
AvidTraveler12||50||Considering that Hyde park is located in the centre of London you will be surprised that it is so large. Richmond Park is bigger but not as central.From Speakers corner, the Serpentine lake, Diana memorial and where we visited this time the Albert memorial opposite the Royal Albert Hall.Probably not wise to walk around the whole park as there is to much to see, view the park in bite size chunks for an hour or two, you are likely to appreciate more.||July 2, 2018
tasgard||40||Great place for a stroll in the sun and watch the passing parade. Each time we walked through there were lots of people around, however there were a few quiet corners to sit and relax. A good central place for us overseas visitors to walk as it is on the way to Oxford street and Marble Arch in one direction, Buckingham palace and Trafalga Square in the other||July 2, 2018
weez1219||50||What an awesome place in the middle of a huge city just to take a peaceful walk and enjoy the scenery. Get a little excercise while unwhinding a bit but lots of stuff to see and stop and admire. ||July 2, 2018
Kimberly C||40||Beautiful multi use park, site of concerts, manual watercraft rentals, dining, swimming, strolling around the pond and gardens. Princess Diana memorial fountain is more of an in ground water slide but certainly has become a place families gather on hot days. ||July 2, 2018
surkho||50||Must must must go. Take the kids, let them roll around in the grass, buy them some burgers, get yourself some beer - it's heaven on earth. So quiet, relaxing and rejuvenating. The best place to spend an afternoon, unwinding. ||July 2, 2018
Lweir19||50||We had a brilliant afternoon exploring here. Went to see the Princes Diana fountain and was very surprised to see hundreds of people playing in it! Tbh looked wonderful since it was 30 degrees today! Had to laugh reading the information to say no standing on granite walls and stepping in water! Had lunch at The Lido, you’ve got to be on your toes to get a table but they have a lovely lunch menu. Great quality and prices you’d expect. The park has chairs for rent, toilets, swimming, paddle boats and cafes all in a beautiful surrounding ||July 1, 2018

Lynn P||50||Stopped at Ottolinghi - Notting Hill and picked up a wonderful array of take out foods before walking down to Hyde Park. A leisurely walk through the park, enjoying the groups of school children romping around the park before we stopped and ate on a park bench. Continued our walk by a lovely garden before exiting the south end on our way to Harrods. Quite a contrast but a lovely end to a memorable day in London.||July 1, 2018
55delaneyw||50||We visited Hyde Park and had a spectacular time! The park was beautiful and there was tons of black and white swans along the Serpentine. We didn’t try the restaurant but it looked amazing.In one area of the park near the Peter Pan Statue there always seem to be parrots flying around. If you hold an apple they’ll fight to get somewhere around you.The Peter Pan Statue is also really cool as well, a gift from the creator of Peter, J.M Barrie. The plaque there was unveiled by Princess Margaret. This is a must - do if your in London!||July 1, 2018
Neil S||40||Always something going on, people watching, bird watching. Wider park with lots of little bits which offer diversion from sweeping vista. Centre piece is the Serpentine - currently with a stunning piece of art. Various cafe's dotted about. Not cheap but add to the experience||July 1, 2018
SafarKhaana||50||I visited London in summers but I also hear they have a very famous Winter Wonderland in winters. Hyde Park is the largest of the four royal parks in London. Seeing the whole park is a big task so unless you have a lot of time, you should check which part you have to visit and which entrance you should take. I got off at the wrong bus stop and we really had to walk a lot till we reached the entrance. You should visit Princess Diana’s memorial which also has a duck lake nearby. You will find children playing in the stream and you can also dip your feet in the really cold water! It’s a really nice park to go for a picnic or to just relax, or go for a run. ||July 1, 2018
82lloydm||40||Hyde Park is one of London must see park, it is one of the Largest parks in London and a Royal park I believe it’s the most famous park in London, it In the middle of some of the key area in London lot of people Flock here day to play relax take in the Sceneries, also known for Speakers corner where people come to speak freely and debate it is a Tradition lasting Hundreds of years. Hyde park reminds me of Central Park in New York in lot of ways but a smaller version, which has many Famous Landmarks a Museum and Generally a fun place to be, I enjoy coming her with the kids ||July 1, 2018
ronyk395||50||Great place to relax, job, chill ... you can take pedalos and enjoy the lakes or chill on the grass with a bottle of wine or have a lunch in the park (bring ur own food or restaurant) ||July 1, 2018
odessadima||30||Super busy . Tons of people . Great part of the park was blocked for an upcoming concert . Due to the heat wave most of the grass was dry . Just an average park - can be definitely skipped . ||July 1, 2018
Gill H||50||Had a lovely stroll around the park, stopped for coffee and toast at the Lido Cafe and visited the Diana Memorial which was well worth going to see. Children Paddeling in the flowing waters and enjoying every minute, delightful tribute to her. ||July 1, 2018

isabellekane2000||50||If there is one park that has everything, this is Hyde park. It’s huge and you can go from walking or sitting under the trees to horse back riding. It is very easily accessible by public transportation, located in the heart of the aristocratic Kensington. Enjoy an afternoon walk there and decompress from running around in the sites of London.||June 29, 2018

lncclc||50||Our host recommended renting bikes (2 GPS) and it was great. We went all over the park. There is a fabulous Christo installation in the Serpentine until the end of September. And it is a good way to get to Kensington Palace and all the way back to the Marble Arch.||June 28, 2018
KateJohn6064||50||Sun is shining and Hyde Park is buzzing with people walking, sunbaking, strolling with babies and school groups. Lovely gardens and buildings and plenty of paths to follow. Recommend a visit.||June 27, 2018
801ChrisD||50||Hyde Park is a fantastic park.There is lots of open space and also lots of nice things to see and do.We visited on a very hot and sunny day to eat some cupcakes and it was a perfect setting.The statue of Albert is incredible and was definitely my favorite spot.||June 27, 2018
Carol I||50||I love to walk around London....I always bring sneakers and Hyde Park is one of my favorite places to go for a run. I have always felt very safe running alone there..||June 27, 2018
loveylavazza||40||Went here on a beautiful day and walked to Oxford street. Very peaceful and tranquil. Stopped at the restaurant for a pizza but too many people making a lot of noise so moved on. The rose garden was very beautiful with several statues and fountains. Did notice that a lot of the lawns were left wild and not mowed. Several seats to sit on along th way which is a rarity in London. Enjoyed our day||June 27, 2018
Speedycat74||40||We walked in at the Marble Arch, and frankly, wondered for about an hour not really knowing how to exit. The park was nice; it was being set up for music concerts in July. The boats on the pond looked fun and refreshing, although the line was long. We just walked, and enjoyed seeing the many geese, pigeons, and swans.||June 27, 2018
Donna G||50||An oasis of calm away from the hustle and bustle of central London. I didn't think there would be anything like this in London. It reminded me of central park in New York. Worth a visit if you want a chill.||June 27, 2018
BorisLikesFood||50||We went on a Saturday, so it was fairly busy but that didn't really affect anything. The huge pond is beautiful and the views of London are excellent.||June 27, 2018
martinsQ6334NU||50||This is a massive park with many features and attractions. Either for a stroll, or a game of rounders with friends, or simply lying in the sun a very relaxing space in a beautiful part of London. Make sure you see the splendour of the Albert Memorial just opposite from the Royal Albert Hall.||June 27, 2018
Lochclose||50||Sometimes you can see the royal horse and their riders exercising in the park sorry I can’t give the times but it is beautiful to watch them and the park is huge easy to wander about see the serpentine you can spend lots of time there||June 26, 2018
Primrose2002||50||Recently visited London for a few days with a couple of friends. We stayed at The Belmont Hotel and walked to Hyde Park on our first afternoon/ evening stay. The Gardens are vast very well manicured. Loads of space to walk, run and picnic - lovely afternoon spent there recommended. ||June 26, 2018
PeterColette||50||We stayed at the Columbia Hotel...just across from the Lancaster Gate.Stunning and peaceful park in the middle of London....beautiful grounds to wander through over several days.Lots of squirrels ( unfortunately no red, only grey ones)Excellent for children and off leash dog area.Many exit gates which lead to shopping, coffee bars etc.||June 26, 2018

_marychampagne111||50||My daughters and I (ages 9 and 13), visited the park a few weeks ago. They loved the ducks and swans by the Serpentine, and my younger daughter loved playing in the playground. We rented a paddle boat for 30 minutes and it was very enjoyable. The rose garden is just beautiful.||June 25, 2018
Gabriel002||50||What a beautiful park! Truly exceptional the beauty and grandeur of this city park. We unfortunately had this on our schedule when the weather wasn't the greatest with a bit of rain.... but still, what an amazing walk around we had. Likely would have spent longer here had the weather been better. We started up by the Marble Arch and worked our way thru to The Serpentine and over by the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain and then towards Kensington Palace. It was all exceptionally beautiful and tranquil, great place to visit and spend a few minutes or a few hours as you can. So many beautiful spots for pictures had the weather been better! But no matter, we enjoyed it very well as it was.... well worth planning this into your visit and spending an ample amount of time here!||June 25, 2018
307juanitak||50||An attractive and safe place to run and bike in London.Interesting plants, trees, and sculptures.Lovely place for a walk and picnic on a summers day.||June 25, 2018
Helen G||50||We specifically visited to see the recently completed installation floating on the Serpentine. It was very impressive and made good photos. The geese were out in force with their goslings. We walked on around to the Tomma Abts exhibition in the Serpentine Gallery in the old Munitions Building. The art was colourful and the history of how the gallery was constructed around the munitions storage chambers (as explained by one of the custodians) was interesting. ||June 25, 2018
Luvinspoonful||50||My favorite park in the world. Squirrels and robins and swans and geese and loads of happy dogs being walked by energetic owners. There’s monuments, sculptures, beautiful gardens and ponds. ||June 25, 2018

205joannag||50||We biked the park and Kensington park and it was awesome. Definitely a must in London. Nice place to picnic or just to take in the views. Adjacent to very tres chic ($$$$) neighborhoods so be prepared to shell out major dough if you decide to eat around here. ||June 25, 2018
3WildThings||50||This park is huge, lots of cafe’s and playgrounds for children. The Princess Diana Memorial Fountain is a lazy river-like type of thing, brilliant for kids to splash about in. Lots of green area around it for a picnic. You can go horse tiding these if pre-booked on their website. The Lido cafe is lovely and does get very busy, it’s just on the river. paddle-boating on the river is very popular and reasonably priced. The park will always have exhibitions on some paid and some free. Car parks there but have to pay even Sunday’s. Free bank holidays. Super day out. ||June 25, 2018
356vijayn||50||visited this moth hyde park is very large and beautiful park with small lake in the centre.anyone freely stroll the park no need to buy any tickets located in very central in london very close to attraction like diana museum and other places easy accessible||June 25, 2018
FoodieeDiva||50||london and its parks are a beauty sply hyde park .. interlinked Kensington Gardens, once the private gardens of Kensington Palace, are among the Royal Parks of London.. beautiful pond and ducks rides for children , a must visit ||June 24, 2018
SuzeeoutoftheCity201||30||I think this is an overrated tourist attraction, it's more of a good location for a nice long run or bike ride, and parts of the park like the Serpentine, the lake and Kensington Gardens are worth a visit, and in the summer there are concerts and in the winter there's winter wonderland. But otherwise, it's always so crowded that you really need to search for a quiet corner if you're looking to read or have a picnic with friends.||June 24, 2018
Lorraine S||50||This is a great park to wander through no matter what time of the year it is. One always sees plenty of bird life and animals, it is so quiet but on the weekends there are plenty of joggers etc.||June 24, 2018
Delilahdr||50||We had been in Italy for over a week, and it was just wall to wall people/tourists everywhere. We had a great time, but we had a couple of days in London before heading back to the USA and it was a wonderful respite from crowds to just have a picnic in Hyde Park, walk around in nature, enjoy the antics of the squirrels, pigeons, ducks, geese, swans, etc. walk through the areas with fountains, take a picture in front of Kensington Palace... it was a peaceful way to spend several hours. The only suggestion I would make would be to have more trash cans - I picked up some litter people had left, which is inexcusable, but I had to carry it for 7-8 minutes' walk before coming to a trashcan. I think maybe people wouldn't litter as much if there were bins available. Other than that- a lovely day.||June 24, 2018

sheila s||50||We walked to Hyde Park as we heard that Christo had a new installment there. The installment was quite interesting but we noticed a crowd growing so wandered to where they were. Low and behold...it was Christo doing interviews about his latest creation. What a great experience to not only see the artwork but also to see the creator. Great memory!||June 24, 2018
Abbeylls||50||My husband and myself visited on a Friday afternoon, we had a lovely long stroll around the park - there is so much to see. The gardens are huge and so well tended, we walked round the Rose Garden, saw the Albert Memorial, Serpentine and Kensington Palace. It is a really nice place to walk around, there could be a few more maps / sign posts to help you find the things to visit though.||June 24, 2018
Peter M||50||This is an enormous park and also has two art galleries-Serpantine and a tribute to Princess Diana.When I went there was many crowd control people in safety vests||June 24, 2018

588jurgenr||50||Hyde Park by itself is already worth a visit ... but with Christo’s Mastaba on Serpentine Lake it is a ‘must see’! Tip: visit the nearby Serpentine Gallery with a special exhibit of Christo and his preparation (and his plan for a much larger - 150meter Mastaba in the Abu Dhabi)!||June 24, 2018
SivaSG50||40||The visit to Hyde Park is always a must when in London.The only issue is that there are not that many park benches around the park and quite a few of the benches are not in the shade which can be difficult during summer.||June 24, 2018

TiborM_12||20||Not a big museum fan, the Kensington palace visit was a waste for me. Otherwise seems just like a regular big park||June 23, 2018
CartwrightD2||50||This place is Gorgeous! Lovely wide, tree lined tarmac paths to walk on which are all on the flat, so making the Park wheelchair, push-chair and bicycle friendly as well as incredibly romantic! This place is huge! It has some beautiful plants, trees and large ponds as well as plenty of places to sit to enjoy it all. I didn't get to see it all but the bits I did see, didn't disappoint! Will have to go back again some day to see the bits I missed.||June 23, 2018
Elaine M||50||If you come to London once in your travels or if you are a frequent visitor this is a place you must visit. You can walk leisurely and feel you aren’t in a bustling city. Or on a sunny day hire a deckchair and sit back and enjoy the scenery. There is plenty of space and greenery to sit and embrace. ||June 23, 2018
eeleeo||50||Went there 3 times to enjoy the nature. The swans, geese and ducks there were so beautiful and hungry. You can prepare some bread for them to eat when you are at the Serpentine. Another surprise was the feeding of parakeets in the evening. As you walk from Long Water to Serpentine, with the Serpentine on your left, you may meet a group of people with stretched arms and apples in their hands. Many parakeets were flying around, perching on the hands, feeding on the apples. Grey squirrel was another sight. They love nuts and crackers. They are not afraid of humans too. If you are an animal lover, Hyde Park is a great place to go.||June 23, 2018
DARADAIusa||50||This park was beautiful in the fall and full of people and tasty things to eat and drink. The park was clean and safe. The gardens are beautiful and it’s a great place to just relax, people watch and enjoy London. ||June 23, 2018
AdelaideGB||50||Hyde Park was beautiful, we walked through each day of our stay in London seeing different sights. It's an easy walk through to Kensington Palace, Marble Arch, Royal Albert Hall and lots more. Each section of the park had a different feel and the walking paths made it easy to get around (although some of the signs pointed in odd directions!). There were squirrels which were fun to watch and they are clearly comfortable with people as the'd come walking straight up to you. Recommend taking your time to explore and enjoy this beautiful piece of London.||June 23, 2018
CarolynH1475||50||We were lucky the sun was out. Wow what a stunning park. London you are very lucky to have such a well maintained park that everyone can enjoy. Spectacular! A must see and do - enjoy the sights||June 23, 2018
Neri2409||50||One of the best places to take a walk, ride a bicycle, ride a horse, go for a run or walk, spend time with friends or alone, watch the birds, watch the nature, have coffee or have picnic. Its a place also where you can escape and take the stress out of the city while you are still in the city ||June 23, 2018
MikeSchrek||40||Staying nearby for business trip, i took the opportunity for several walks around the park. Enough walking paths to get confused, but never lost! Completely safe and many families, couples, and individuals walking about. A wonderful place||June 23, 2018
Elizabeth R||50||After more than a week in ancient buildings and museums, we wanted a day outside. Our hotel being close to Hyde Park, this was our choice. The park is huge, with wonderful flowers and huge old trees. We loved the Serpentine, a man-made lake with lots of waterfowl. One can rent boats or horses. We had lunch at one of the several cafes - surprisingly good food and quite clean. A great change from being indoors all day. ||June 23, 2018
Unit623||40||Spent a very enjoyable just lazing and walking in the park. In all my years of travelling to London never been.Decided to walk through the park fom Knightsbridge to Marbl Arch, very relaxing sitting on the grass although large areas were unavailable due to preperations for a festival in July. However very peaceful sat in the hot sunshine.||June 23, 2018
Jamie O||40||Hyde Park is a lovely park, but prepare yourself for how big it is. To walk it will take some time. We visited Speakers Corner on Sunday afternoon. It was a bit disappointing...mostly Christians and Muslims yelling at each other about how everyone is going to hell. We also went to Princess Diana's fountain. It was lovely and packed with children. We sat by the Serpentine Lake for a while and just people watched. You can rent paddle boats to take out on the lake. They have lounge chairs near Speakers Corner that you can rent for a sit in the sun. Again, this is a huge park, so plan accordingly for your tube stop to get off at the part of it you most want to see.||June 23, 2018

homesteads||50||This is a beautiful park to spend time in. There are lots of things to see and do. A walk through Kensington Gardens is a must. The Serpentine is a great place to wander both banks and enjoy the wildlife. Take a boat out on it. Swim or sit on the striped deckchairs and take in the atmosphere. There are cafes serving tea, alcohol and food. We went to see the floating art installation comprised of oil drums by the artist Christo. It was very very good. Definitely worth seeing before it is dismantled. It is called the Mastaba and is 20 metres high.||June 22, 2018
janelitamirta||50||The trees, the gardens, everything. What a nice place to spend time by yourself or with children. I loved the "upside down tree". ||June 22, 2018

hickmananastasian||50||Hyde Park was my favorite part of London. You can spend an entire day at Hyde Park. There are many places to visit. There are families and people all throughout the park. The part is safe for solo travelers. The park is also filled with an abundance of nature and animals! ||June 21, 2018
KarinB3300||50||This is a wonderful place to rest as well as walk in the lovely gardens revive the body and soul. The water park was lively with. Iris and boats. The gardens are in full bloom and a wonder to look at. The facilities are of a high standard.||June 21, 2018
TravelFan48105||40||Hyde Park is a huge green space (it is the largest of the Royal Parks). It has several important features. The best way to explore it is on foot along the many paths, over several visits. Look out for well known sights such as the Grand Entrance and Wellington Arch at Hyde Park Corner, Speaker's Corner (Sunday mornings), and the Diana Memorial Fountain, and take a break at the Serpentine Bar and Kitchen with its great water views.||June 20, 2018
travelbugdon||50||Love walking in Hyde Park. Among other things to do is tour Kensington Palace,former home of Charles and Diana. You can also lounge on many of the lounging chairs. But, you pay a rental fee for these. A meter maid comes along and you purchase a time ticket. The grounds are beautiful. Oh, by the way, you can bring your dog. The Royal family loves animals so you’ll see lots of pets including horses.||June 20, 2018
sarahruffles||50||The Park was so beautiful and vast, very busy even on a week day which was lovely to see, there were a troup of gardeners doing their best to keep the borders tip top.||June 20, 2018
da_jm||50||I've traveled to London many times, but somehow had never been through Hyde Park. What a mistake which I quickly made up for on this last trip! We stayed north of the park and walked through different parts multiple times. It's a stunning park with gorgeous flowers, water displays and even a spot to dip your feet in (the Princess Diana memorial). Highly recommend walking through (but if you bike it, please pay attention to the bike paths!).||June 20, 2018
Karen T||50||This is such a wonderful escape from the hustle and bustle of London. It offers lots of open green spaces yet plenty to keep you entertained. The Serpentine Cafe is a must, with amazing food, great views and friendly staff. If you want that little bit of down time Hyde Park is the place||June 20, 2018
dacsue||50||Nothing like a walk in the park on a summer day. Amazing how quiet it is and not that many people. Definitely recommended when in London especially if you want a picnic, sit down or just to relax.||June 20, 2018
Paul_In_Canada||50||This is a great park with plenty of nice trails. Just make sure you take some comfortable shoes for walking. They have benches if you get tired, you can always sit and have a little break.||June 19, 2018
The_Loup_Garou||40||Over about the past 10 years, we have stayed immediately across from Hyde Park, on Park Lane. This time, we were still staying in Mayfair, but several blocks from Hyde Park. That, however, did not stop us from taking a stroll through parts of Hyde Park, and we started up by Speakers’ Corner, at the Cumberland Gate. We kept to the east side of the Park, for the most part, but did deviate over to The Serpentine, for part of the stroll. We exited at the Albert Gate, into Knightsbridge, as my wife needed some cosmetics.On this glorious April day, Spring had come to Hyde Park, and so had the crowds. It seemed that most of the residents of London were out, and enjoying the sunshine. Now, one aspect that we had not considered (at least not enough) was the number of skaters, and bicyclists, who where also enjoying the Park. We had to keep our eyes open, and also our ears, so that we were no in the way of faster-moving folk. Even with the crowds, we managed to make our way safely.We reentered the Park, in the little section, where Hyde and Green Parks intersect – that little “square” section, right at Hyde Park Corner. Now, I am never sure which Park, that section is officially in, and have friends in London, who argue long and hard for Hyde, but about the same number, who insist that it is in Green Park... Oh well, it’s the little section, partially circled by Duke of Wellington Place. This little section also had crowds, where it usually seems to have many fewer, than Hyde Park “proper.” A gorgeous Spring day (April) will do that to folk!We then crossed back under Piccadilly, and returned to our hotel, The Chesterfield, but with a stop into The Dorchester for wine at their lovely bar.||June 19, 2018
michelf28||50||I like wandering through the park. Plenty to see with the monuments and Kensington palace. Plenty of seating and this park is tidy unlike others||June 19, 2018
MissS115||50||it’s a very nice park with two small lakes. there are a lot of ducks. you can also see a lot of squirrels in the park.we hired a bike and cycled cross the park, that was very nice!||June 19, 2018
mrsagf||40||This Victorian rose garden was re-landscaped in 1994 as a gorgeous embellishment of Hyde Park Corner Gate, the Hyde Park Corner entrance to the Park. There is a circular rose garden of trellised climbing roses, with a statue of a boy and dolphin in the center. Other beds of roses and companion plants lead away into the park. Magnificent in May and June. Can easily be combined with a visit to Apsley House.||June 19, 2018
Pipa-in-BsAs||50||Love to walk around and discover the paths and be away from the city but still being there! Get lost in between the trees!||June 19, 2018

Eagle6869||50||Great extensive park. Plenty to do swimming , boating of various types on the lake. Cafes too but shop in food stores around and take a picnic. You can rent deckchsirs if you don't want to sit on the grass. There are benches but these get taken quickly. You can sit and watch the world go buy or rent a bike and cycle round and go past the Albert memorial. ||June 18, 2018
Eileen37||50||One of my favourite parks it’s such a vast wonderful open space amongst hussle and bustle of our capital and if you’re really lucky you get to see the horse guards too!||June 18, 2018
Made_in_Mumbai||40||One of those places which you cannot miss if you're in London. A great place to relax, or have a walk or unwind with nature with friends and family. ||June 18, 2018
Adam B||40||This is generally a nice large park, with lots of trails going every which way. There are a few bike share stations in the park, and bike trails. It had some nice views of Kensington Palace, plus the pond with all the swans. There wasn't a whole lot of shade on a sunny day||June 18, 2018
Cathy C||40||We enjoyed walking around the park, plenty of photo opportunities. A visit to Kensington Palace to view the sunken garden and afternoon tea was the highlight.||June 18, 2018
Zanotti-A-broad||50||I always stay close to Hyde Park so that I may run here in the mornings -- fantastic loop. Lovely walks through the rose-lined paths, or lingering with a coffee by the pond... ||June 18, 2018
doloresiorizzo||50||Hyde Park is such a great place. It is not only beautiful but also clearly one of the most active places in London. Food, paddle boats, cafe life, running, swimming, family friendly, and a perfect place to meet up. Remember to bring some cash to rent a paddle boat and then sit in the restaurant with a pint looking at other people do the same. Perfect view of London from the bridge. Henry James claims it is the most striking view of Westminster.||June 18, 2018
301kikkik||50||And so does most of London. Just a nice relaxing place to spend a day when there is nice weather. Take a walk or stay awhile. Very nice. ||June 18, 2018

Erika B||50||During a sunny :) May visit I had the luxury of jogging each morning in Hyde Park. I just loved exploring the park by foot:)...so many sites to see. In the morning there are very few tourists and it feels like it is just yours to play in. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. If you have young kids - bring them to Diana Memorial Playground!! They will have a blast! ||June 18, 2018
Roman P||50||We had a fantastic time with our kids ...Flowers, all the colours of the world, trees, plants, everything so harmonised.We paid £29 for a family ticket for one hour and enjoyed every second of the trip with swans, ducks, geese...At the end we fed the birds and they were eating from our hands .After that we went to a restaurant on the shore and had a tasty lunch.We had a fantastic time !!!If you need to recover after a stress - that's the place ||June 18, 2018
MarioJoao||50||Hyde Park is one of those places you can't forget to go if you're in London. And there are plenty of good reasons for that. Either go just for a break walk to refresh your mind, or go for a jogging or even playing tennis :-) These and a lot more reasons to take a bit each day to go and reset your mind.||June 18, 2018
shirleywhelan1||50||A lovely park and lake to have a picnic at, anyone can enjoy sitting here and enjoy the scenery and hire a boat to go out on the lake||June 18, 2018
DawnV238||30||A little walk and then chill out before the theatre in pleasant surrounding, hard to believe that you are in the heart of the city. Don’t try and use the toilet facilities though as the assistant is running some kind of scam. She turns the turnstile off every now and then and collects the cash as people come in. Filthy and disgusting too, the facilities that is; not the assistant!!!||June 18, 2018
gparada11||40||One of the larger parks in greater London and a good place for a stroll after dinner or visiting the nearby sites. Watch out towards the evening around the lake where the mosquitos are in full effect. We came here several times during our recent holidays and lots of place to stop and take in the sites.||June 17, 2018
AislingP916||50||Walked for hours through Hyde park, lots to see, serpentine boasting lots of new baby cygnets , many enjoying deck chairs or picnics on grass, got a gear bonus when the gun salute for queens birthday was carried out by the artillery ... so memorable. Great place to relax on a pleasant day or for early morning walks ||June 17, 2018

Debbie A||50||The park has lots of activities to do if you want. Great for kids. Has lots of birdlife, including beautiful white swans. Also the place to see the princess Diana memorial fountain. Coffee shops and food places were also dotted throughout the park. Walking through the park is good as there are bitumened walking tracks. Lots of people there walking their dad's. A very pleasant place to be||June 17, 2018
Cherie L||50||Lovely on the day we visited..clear blue skies, sunny and warm.. gardens throughout were well kept, just a nice place to go for a long relaxing walk.. ||June 17, 2018
LondonBen10||50||This iconic park is worth visiting out of the tourist season when it is less crowded. People tend to overfeed the birds so they are very domesticated. Best to visit in the colder months.||June 17, 2018
damianfrosberg||50||I have to say, I was completely astonished by the amount of grass that covers this park. The trees and the walkway provide an amazing sensory experience. Please note:this is the end of my review for this location however if you wish to read on, please do. Recently, I have noticed that my helpful votes and views have decreased slightly. To show you're a true supporter, be sure to smash that thumbs up button, to be entered into my giveaway later this month!! Thank you kindly.||June 17, 2018
mmajohnson||50||We ended up cutting through Hyde Park on our way to a different location and it was probably my favorite part of the day. Wide pathways, beautifully maintained lawns, peaceful water features. I could easily see packing a picnic and just plopping down in the park to relax! ||June 17, 2018

Sush19067||50||I arrived in London and after checking into my hotel I wanted to walk. Caesar Hotel is not far from Hyde Park and I entered at the Marlborough Gate by the Italian Gardens. I walked through the gardens to the other side to Harrods. Along the way there are beautiful planting’s, lawn chair to sit and relax. Water features and people feeding parrots! Everyone seems to be enjoying the warm weather and nature. Truly a gem!||June 16, 2018
EricaK2013||50||Beautiful large park at the heart of London where you can get away from the husttle and bustle of the city. It has small lake, where you can see for example swans. There is also a lovely cafe/restaurant to get your tummy full when you feel the need. ||June 16, 2018
Chris M||50||I love Hyde Park. It is so beautiful and a splash of the countryside in the middle of London. The paths wide though, London Plane trees are splendid in summer. Sure there is lots of people but it’s a big place and plenty of space for all.||June 16, 2018

emohawk||40||An oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. It is literally a breath of fresh air after consuming the incredible amount of cigarette smoke that seems to be everywhere on the streets.Be mindful of the bike vs walking tracks as bikes can be quite dangerous especially around commuter time.Lots of wildlife, some particularly bold squirrels.And much bigger than I ever imagined!Spend some time in this famous park and chill for a while....||June 16, 2018
SihamL65||50||Such a gorgeous place to enjoy nature and have a nice stroll. Walking through Hyde Park made me wish I had brought my running clothes on vacation. I was so jealous of all the runners and cyclists in this park. Seems like such a great place to run! ||June 15, 2018
milljl37||50||We spend a lot of time in Hyde Park, very relaxing lots of places to sit and relax and enjoy the wildlife. Recommend this to anyone!||June 15, 2018
907philt||40||Such a wonderful place for all ages. You can walk and lose yourself for hours. The park it's self is relaxing and due to there being a play park (Kensington end) suitable for young children. My only complaint and it's not the fault of the royal parks is that some dog owners are unwilling to clean up after there dogs which I find disrespectful.||June 15, 2018
catharinel||50||Hyde Park is just one of the many fabulous green spaces within the city of London. There are many places that you can stop for a snack or for a meal. The Serendipity Lake has paddleboats ans swans a swimming. And one mustn't forget to take in Speakers Corner to take in peaceful protests or evangelical preachers!||June 14, 2018
travelyss||50||Hyde Park is truly lovely on a normal day and even more special when it offers festivals such as the Christmas Market. ||June 14, 2018
liaail||40||We were in the middle of our daily visit when we decided to cross Kensington gardens and reach walking the city center. When we started walking we had not decided yet to cross the whole Hyde Park, but it all came very natural. It was so relaxing seeing families and tourists and locals enjoying the sunny day and sharing that little oasis in the middle of the town.||June 14, 2018

DettaP||50||We were lucky enough to be there at a time when the gardens looked wonderful. Walked through the whole park and enjoyed seeing the free roaming English gardens. Had a quick bite by the water. Don’t waste too much money eating there. A beer and a snack are fine. We didn’t boat. Not a great day for it. But fun nonetheless. ||June 11, 2018

Peter J||50||Visited with my family, we only managed to walk through a small section of it but we all enjoyed it. Lots of places to picnic which makes a cost effective way to 'eat out'. The cafe/kiosks are good places to pick up a coffee or tea, Watched the Household Cavalry walk pass. Must visit again sometime.||June 9, 2018
marcelloi318||10||We literally lost half a day in this park looking for the statue of Peter Pan that disappointed the expectations of our daughter, a lover of his adventures, and then look for the play area that actually is nothing. There is so much green but nothing more that can not be found anywhere.||June 9, 2018

VickiC02||30||Myself and husband rented a couple of bikes from the bike rentals at the park entrance and rode around the park looking at some of the statues, etc. The problem is that you can't bike on all the trails and you have to stick to the "bike trails" and there aren't many. We found them very limiting and we missed out on some things we wished we could have seen. Otherwise, it was a fun afternoon.||June 7, 2018
Mistigc||50||Tranquil and Scenic. We had breakfast by the water and watched people go about their daily business. Rose Garden is amazing and highly recommend this walk through the park.||June 6, 2018

Zwillingsseele||40||When you are in London it is a must to spend some time at this huge park area in the middle of the town. I went there on a Sunday, so it was a quite crowded. There is also the famous „Speaker corner“ with these crazy people holding a strange speech. You can just sit there or have a picnic or just having a walk. It is nice to enjoy the London atmosphere there.||June 6, 2018

Helvellyn2009||50||Spent lovely day in the park. Beautiful rose garden, walk ways, grass areas, boating lake, paddle boats, exhibitions, quiet areas, picnics, a lovely lovely park.

BPO1031||50||Hyde Park was one of my favorite places 25 years ago when I lived in England, and i was afraid it may have somehow diminished in the ensuing years. Not to fear- it is very well-maintained and worth a stroll. Lots of benches along the route to enjoy the natural beauty and wildlife||June 4, 2018

It’s a great place to just sit and relax in the middle London.||June 3, 2018
Paul N||50||The park was very busy (a gorgeous Sunday afternoon) but it was great to wander along the lake side, watch the rollerblading and then saunter across the grass to Speakers' Corner before getting the tube at Marble Arch.||June 3, 2018
grannytina2018||50||Nice relaxing stroll through park to reach Harrods, with some history along the way, no better way to spend a sunny afternoon ||June 3, 2018
PeterTML||40||This park is just perfect for a good day um the nature... You can choose what to do: run, walk, picknick, lay down in the grass, go for a boat ride, play football, feed the geese and the swans,... A fully enjoyable park!||June 3, 2018
ErPr||40||Told myself I'd check out more of this park than I did. It's a lot of walking if you really want to explore. I think you're best off coming at it from different places on separate visits. For example, take on Speaker's Corner and Marble Arch (and the surrounding park) on one day when you're already in the area. If you're checking out Kensington palace, you may want to say on the west or southwest corner of the park, near Albert Memorial.We came up from Harrod's (entering at Park Cl) and followed The Serpentine all the way up past the Lido and Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, finally arriving at the Italian Water Gardens. That was quite a walk, but we did a little people watching along the way, especially at the fountain, and there was plenty of bird watching, especially since we were trailing someone (the bird man? I think I heard someone say) who was feeding birds, who would come up to him and even sit on him like Snow White or something. The Lido Bar & Cafe fortunately had a free toilet that we were able to use along the way. Otherwise it is a long stretch. Near the Italian Water Gardens, the public restroom was 30p, I think.The Serpentine itself isn't particularly dramatic or interesting. Just wet. The bird watching is pleasant, and I thought the fountain was pretty cool. There were specific instructions not to climb in and walk on the stone, for safety reasons, but of course people had their children running around in there. At any rate, it was nice seeing people relax and seek relief on a sunny day in that spot, and the execution of the memorial is interesting and worth a look.The Italian Water Gardens look like they've seen better days. Still an interesting stop, especially after walking for so long (and many people were sunning themselves or otherwise relaxing on the grassy hill just above the area), but it would be nice to see some funds put into keeping it looking how one can only imagine it's capable of looking.||June 3, 2018
candylaucy||50||Don’t expect to see many things in Hyde Park. What you can see is many many trees and grasses, people comfortably sitting on the grass with their books and sunbathing, children playing around,people feeding birds and swans, squirrels running around, people having their jogging...what you can feel here is relax and comfort. I really like this place a lot and I definitely will have a run here next time.||June 2, 2018
nottoogrumpy||50||Even on a sunny bank holiday, Hyde Park still isn't crowded. You can still find a nice patch of grass, maybe even a bench, to sit and watch the wildlife (human or otherwise), or just walk round and explore. I found the allotment area, which I didn't know existed.||June 2, 2018
karen t||40||We spent a few hours here just wandering along, enjoying the beauty of the park with the trees, flowers and wildlife. There are plenty of places to sit and enjoy the scenery and no need to hurry - enjoy||June 2, 2018
amfr08||50||My husband and I walked through Hyde Park on our way to Kensington Palace and so that we could see the Peter Pan statue. It snowed while we were there in February, but the scenery was still beautiful. Also, if you are a dog lover on vacation, this park will be one of your favorites! Everyone has their pups out playing fetch, etc. A great park and well worth the stop!||June 1, 2018
Btravellor||50||Walked into the park and saw Rotten Row and horse riders, lunch viewing the Serpentine and then a walk through the gardens||June 1, 2018
jeff h||40||this a very big and beautiful with lots to do, was able to be there at sunset and it was beautiful over the pond. ||June 1, 2018
Halvard S||50||This park is awesome. Locals hang out here and to me that is always a good sign. The park is so big and it feel like you are anywhere but in the middle of a big city. Beein here felt like a vacation within the vacation. Well kept, and lots of activities. People had picnics, played ball games and had lots of fun. We loved it||June 1, 2018
278kirstinh||50||This was park was amazing! We rented bikes and rode around the boarder of the park. A lot of the paths in the park are not bike permitted. We ended up changing our hotel to a hotel closer to Hyde Park because we enjoyed it so much. We will definitely be going back. ||June 1, 2018
757SueH||50||We are lucky enough to be staying in walking distance of Hyde Park. It is a huge park. Some of the flower gardens are beautiful. Fantastic statues too. Busy, busy park!||June 1, 2018
profjoypc||50||When you fly over London you get a sense of just how much greenery there is, and on the ground in places such as Hyde Park you certainly come to know that London is far more than a huge built up city. Hyde Park is a major area of parkland, the largest of the several Royal Parks in the vicinity. There are some wonderful trees and plantings, plus natural areas and vast expanses of water. As a whole it is a haven for wildlife and a wonderful place to walk and jog. There is also an assortment of statues and memorials and places to eat and drink. The park is a favourite venue for various concerts and gatherings. Well worth a visit.||June 1, 2018
SimonaS1132||50||Hyde park is amazing, very beautiful park and very well maintained. There is loads to do for families. Down by the lake you can hire some boats, which is great fun for the kids. You can bring a packed lunch and spend the whole day in the park.||May 31, 2018
davidnD9373QO||50||This is my favorite park! Beautiful walk and many mansions on the north end that back to park, and of course the Kensington Palace is also in Hyde Park. A must see. Have money on you to use bathrooms.||May 31, 2018
somam||40||Hyde park stretches few kilometers in peremeter. Its amazing to walk around amidst such greenery. The waterbodies with swans and ducks are delightful. Great place for picnic. ||May 31, 2018
BarbaraHama||50||when you are tired of visiting museums and looking around, this is a place to rest in the open air for a while. the park is very big, you can also walk nearby the lake. I really recommend everyone to spand a couple of hours in Hyde Park..||May 31, 2018
BarbieintheCity||30||make sure you have spare change for the loos and if you go on the lake GET A RECEIPT or they will scam you!! Not my favorite park in London but great for a quick feet-up after shopping. ||May 31, 2018
Lissel A||40||A wonderful large scale green space that gets utilised by locals and visitors for exercise, lunch, sunbaking, playing games, or just to get to somewhere else. No matter how many people were there you could find somewhere isolated to make you feel like you had it all to yourself. I'm sure we missed lots of features and expect that if we spent a whole day there, we would still find more to see. I'm only holding back to a "very good" rating because I didn't get to see enough of it to justify a full excellent rating.||May 31, 2018
Scott S||50||A world class city with a world class park.What a treat to be enraptured with the heightened splendor of Central London and then find solace in this magnificent park.||May 30, 2018
521MichaelS||40||Hyde Park is a lovely recreational park in the middle of London. It's size is approximate to Central Park in New York City. But the gem of the place is in the southwest corner of the park where you'll find the Rose Garden and a number of other beautiful flowering displays. It's a killer-great place for a picnic and lots of fun pictures. Don't miss it. ||May 30, 2018
PLAfromMichigan||40||A walk in Hyde park puts you in the face of British history, both old and new, and the grand expanse of one of the world's great city parks. My review is woefully inadequate at the task of surveying this park and its monuments and memorials. Let me mention only one: the magnificent Albert Memorial, so grand that it defies modern sensibilities.||May 30, 2018
Facemaker01||40||Due to a bad case of jetlag, we walked through Hyde Park at about 5.30am! It was eerily quiet and was a great way to get acquainted with the park. Crazy people were swimming in the Serpentine and the Swans were lovely to see. Diana's memorial and the Italian Gardens were great to see as well.My biggest gripe was the Public Toilets...20-50p for a Pee!Also they weren't open at 7.00 as publicised. The 50p toilet block was pretty 'crappy'.Broken seats and excrement up the wall.....not pleasant.During the hot days on the long weekend, the park was full of tourists, sunbakers and loungers....was great to see people out and about.||May 30, 2018
paulav131||50||The park is beautiful and the rose garden was spectacular. There were all kinds of activities going on and it was a very vibrant area.||May 30, 2018

Cfab777||40||I was staying not far from Hyde Park during a short stay in London and decided one Sunday to take a walk through Hyde Park. As it transpired I met en route the "tail-end" of the Moonwalk for breast cancer - they looked shattered from their overnight efforts. When I arrived at Hyde Park I spotted legions of bowler-hatted gentlemen (and ladies) - it turned out that this was the Old Comrades March for ex-cavalry officers. Interesting to see and to watch the associated pageantry. What was intended to be a meditative walk turned out to be a most interesting sojourn - I guess Hyde Parkers must witness a range of such events. Certainly worth a visit.||May 30, 2018
luisa b||50||It is a huge nice park close to Buckingham palace and Kensington. THere are a lot of different animals.||May 30, 2018
neilkeeble2018||50||Enjoyed the weather. A lovely romantic stroll with my wife. Lovely to see families using the park. Very clean/tidy||May 30, 2018
seand423||50||It’s much bigger than it seems, so give yourself plenty of time to cross it. We stayed nearby and walked through or along it to get almost everywhere. Lots of pollen and stuff blowing around in the spring, so beware if you have allergies. Lots of people walking around, lots of friendly dogs, and some dedicated paths for bikes, horses, etc. There are a few notable memorials and statues spread throughout, as well. ||May 30, 2018

StephenieU||50||Walked through this park while heading to Buckingham Palace. It was very clean and there were a lot of people running around the park. It’s extremely close to the center of everything and easy to get to by bus. ||May 29, 2018
maureenbythesea||50||We spent a few hours strolling through the park and enjoying people watching. There are benches on which to rest, and there's plenty to see here. This is simply a lovely place to enjoy London and Londoners.||May 29, 2018
Tupac96||50||Every time I visit London I always make time to visit Hyde park . It’s a wonderful place to have a walk and relax . If the weather is sunny there aren’t many better places to relax in London. There is a cafe on the park that sells good food and cold drinks all at reasonable prices . You can hire a deck chair for a couple of pounds and relax looking over the lake . A wonderful place to visit while in London.||May 29, 2018
T6762GVstephanies||50||Think Central park - in the center of town and a lovely break from the noise and the people and the cars. ||May 29, 2018
Avram C||50||Simply amazing! You must go there if ever in London. You won’t regret it. We rented the Santander bicycles to get around and had a fantastic day. ||May 29, 2018
Regina M||40||Pleasant walking through here. Scenic areas all around. Very nice to walk through here to get to Kensington palace. I recommend taking the walk along the pond in the center. ||May 29, 2018

Laurel G||50||The park is beautiful, easy to navigate, and centrally located. Spend some time exploring the paths and statues or relaxing. I’ll definitely return on any future trips to London. ||May 28, 2018
Juliet18064||50||Although it was busy the park was beautifully kept full of birds with their chicks and full over beautiful plants and flowers. We also saw parakeets and very tame squirrels. Stopped for a drink which was reasonably priced for London.||May 28, 2018
Aizhan_Kuss||50||Good nature! But many peoples are on this park.Very big ,there is different part only for family with children and for dogs)I prefer Regent park. ||May 28, 2018
Ajay Singh S||50||If you go to London, you must must visit the Hyde Park. Its a big and beautiful park. You should take around 4 hours to cover the whole park. Its green paradise with a serene lake, carpets of grass with various trees, ducks in the lake who also come out to greet visitors, beautiful birds chirping, strolling, flying, roads criss crossing through the park, a sense of peace and calm all around...... It may not appeal to Europeans as much as it will tourits as it will appeal to Indians and other Asians. If I have to rank, I will rank and rate the Hyde park higher than the London eye or Madame Tussads or the Buckingham Palace. Its THAT GOOD.||May 28, 2018
LeeannaL3||50||The royal parks are all lovely and clean but Hyde park offers so much to do ! I love going on the pedal boats and sewing the parrots who come and sit on your hands if you take nuts with you. Then there is the lovely Peter Pan statue and fantastic ambience on the rare sunny days that England is graced with ! If you fancy cycling you can hire a bike and cycle all around the park ! It is one of theost beautiful places in London !||May 28, 2018
RoselledFW||50||Nice place to spend your break time from sightseeing or shopping trip during good sunny weather. My kids loved running around and observing the squirrels, birds, ducks and swans you can see while in the park. There were also trees that kids can climb safely as they are not so high and quite sturdy. There is also a small patch of botanical garden where kids can smell the roses. It is relaxing just to be there.||May 28, 2018
dickydoodaa||40||A must when touring London especially on a warm sunny day, hundreds of people just laying on the grass, kids playing in the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain and everyone just enjoying one of the nicest days of 2018, and only a short walk from the madness of London City.||May 27, 2018
MS4866||40||If your children have had enough of tourist sites/sights, let them off the leash here. Like all the best city parks, Hyde Park has many different areas, each with its own atmosphere. It merges seamlessly with Kensington Gardens which has still more to offer. On sunny days it is thronged with tourists, London families and people just enjoying themselves. On a frosty winter day it is a wonderfully beautiful landscape. There are statues, temples, herbaceous borders, and - best seen in the setting sun - the blazing gold statue of the Prince Consort, whose memorial is one of the most splendidly over-the-top things to be seen anywhere.||May 27, 2018
Laura S||40||During our trip we walked through Hyde Park several times as it was near our Hotel . Gorgeous grounds , iconic statues and memorials. ||May 27, 2018

SalimM||40||A lazy stroll on a very sunny Sunday. Lots to see and listen at speakers corner a unique feature which you cannot find anywhere else in the world. The park is huge. Somewhere towards the middle is a lake where you can hire paddle boats. Plenty of deck chairs all round which can be hired for a small fee. Then there is the Diana memorial. Interesting all round. perfect to relax and chill out.||May 27, 2018
rodc899||50||After walking the park and enjoying it beauty, we spend at least 30 minutes watching several roller bladers practice their tricks. We would have stayed longer, but we were hungry for supper. The restaurant in the park closed at 5:00. We had to look for other places to eat nearby and there are none. After looking for about an hour we took a cab back to our hotel area and ate there.||May 27, 2018
ASHOK P||50||Could see various species of ducks and birds .Also could feed parrots and squirrels in park by your own hand ||May 27, 2018
Don H||30||Beautiful spot, particularly found the speakers corner interesting. Here in Canada we have nothing similar, people simply got up on their soap box and spoke to the crowd.||May 26, 2018
ramonanovi||50||Hyde Park is a perfect British celebration of the joy of life. It is sophisticated (like Diana's memorial), cozy (a lot of active or meditative people), mysterious (like Peter Pan's statue or the Renaissance garden). It has an unique spirit of harmony between mind, spirit and body.||May 26, 2018

th0masellam||50||This park is beautiful. To be fair all are fabulous in central London however we spent the most time here. The park is beautifully kept and a pleasure to stroke through on a hot day. It was also great to see so many Londoners out sitting and not walking furiously. ||May 24, 2018
DinahGO||50||What fun there is to be had. Glorious weather and bikes to hand. Spent a happy few hours cycling from one part to another. Best £2 to be had in the capital. A wonderful park in every way, the lungs of London||May 24, 2018
Baldaquin||40||Beautiful park to stroll in on a sunny day in London. I even saw some blossoms in May it was beautiful.... this being said, there is not a lot of benches and chairs on the lawn are quite expensive to rent. But it's still worth a little walk.||May 24, 2018
cavus||40||Nice large park, busy but with quite spots if you look for them, always something going on, get a deck chair and watch the world go by.||May 24, 2018

StevePower1976||50||I went to Hyde Park in May 2018. I hired a Santander bike for riding around this magnificent park, all 350 acres of it. bike hire was cheap as you are charged about 2 pounds per hour after an initial free period. The Serpent lake was a great spot to see all the bird life. Squirrels were at play taking food from your hand and people just lazing in the park made for relaxation all around me with the sunny day.Food served in the park was of good quality.Kensington Palace is very much worth a look and the space in such a large city is a credit to the city itself.||May 23, 2018
Alan K||50||Hyde Park was beautiful; something different around every corner. The grounds were perfectly maintained and there were memorials to the victims of different military actions.||May 23, 2018

lrozman1989||50||I do love parks, but the animals which I found here make this into a open zoo rather than a normal park. After a busy day in London, nothing could calm you down more than a stroll down Hyde Park.||May 22, 2018

Kayleigh D||30||Lovely park to visit and the lake is absolutely beautiful, the park is very well maintained too. There is many cyclists so walking around can get a little bit of pain when you have bikes coming in all directions. Although they had designated paths for bikes in the park a lot of the time cyclists were just ignoring them.The cafe inside the park, next to the lake was beautiful however it was very hipster and overpriced. ||May 21, 2018
Jenny M||50||What a fabulous place to chill and relax Stunning formal gardens and fountains Or wander further for peace and quite Parts of this stunning park are so quiet you’d never believe you were in central London Walk along the many paths.

Jan P||50||Hyde Park is great. It's large & you can see many different things each time you visit. On a recent 9 day stay in the capital we went to Hyde Park at least 4 times. People enjoy many aspects of this green space & the lake has beautiful waterfowl & there are colorful parakeets in the park. You can get something to eat or have tea or ice cream or just stroll around. One of the nicest!||May 21, 2018

MyLittleVoyage||50||Hyde Park is a vast and beautiful park, in central London.For me, Hyde Park is one of those beautiful areas you can explore without a real "plan" or itinerary. That is where the fun is. Seeing all the different flowers, plants, wildlife and just being out in the open - even in the middle of a city the size of London - is where the charm is.It's a wonderful place in summer. Picnics here can be truly magical.||May 21, 2018
JILLIAN F||50||I always love visiting and walking around Hyde Oark. It is great to start at different places because it is very diverse and you always discover different parts.||May 20, 2018

mcpackard||50||Hyde Park was beautiful and convenient for biking through. We were able to see locals roller skating and skate boarding, sitting in chairs in the sun and paddle boats on the lake. We also found the Peter Pan statue. Beautifully colored parakeets were found just landing on people as they stood still holding apples. ||May 20, 2018
AmandaA4956||40||Hyde Park is the biggest park in London, and offers a huge range of grass and water activities for tourists and locals alike. You can walk or run around the park's beautiful green scenery, or you can stroll along the river or ponds to watch the ducks, swans, geese, and pigeons. As an American it was actually really surprising to me to see how used to people these birds are, as swans are generally pretty aggressive in the United States.But here, the birds are so tame that they'll eat out of your hand if you have bird feed. However, I would still recommend keeping a respectful distance from the birds because they are still wild animals and should not be touched or handled in the same way as a pet.In addition to the wildlife, there are also several cafes and food trucks around if you get hungry.Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.||May 20, 2018
Sonia M||50||Had a fantastic picnic in the park on a lovely afternoon. I love London's parks. Hyde Park in particular is massive, you could easily spend a day here. Great for lazing around watching the world go by and easy to forget you're actually in the centre of London!||May 20, 2018

Lucy G||50||When you are fed up with the bustle of Oxford Street, or similar, just walk over to Hyde Park for some quiet. (It's a short walk from Selfridges). The park is enormous, with some flowers beds, and big open expanses of grass and trees. Round the edge is a sandy gallop used by the Household Cavalry and the riding school (catch them early in the morning for a great dawn mist photo.) The Serpentine has boat hire, a cafe and deckchairs for hire, but many Londoners just have a picnic there on fine days. Lovely in winter too (but less good for picnics!)||May 20, 2018
Buzzman11||50||our trip to london was blessed by the weather it was a balmy 27deg c so the park was alive with people and animals ,simply breath taking ! a must see !!||May 19, 2018
kwagmeister||50||Walking through Hyde Park is a fun experience. On a sunny day like today was people are all over enjoying the weather. Crossing through the park takes you from Mayfair to Buckingham Palace, as well as to other parts of the city — and the park is so serene it’s just wonderful walking through it. Right now the flowers are blooming beautifully - perhaps not great for those with spring allergies but the scents are heavenly. Wide walkways mean no real congestion - room for bikes, walkers, and runners alike.In a city the size and population of London having the size and quality of parks like Hyde Park is a real boost to the city. Lovely!||May 19, 2018

GuimaraPerpetuo||40||This is a place to be in a day like yesterday with lots of sunshine. There is plenty of space for walk among the nice trees and people enjoying the sun. The grass allow you to go there for picnic with friends and play soccer or any other sport that requires space. There are so many interesting attractions like the Serpentine, the monument to Diana princess, and so one. It is a place you cannot miss when having a day to relax in London.||May 17, 2018

SandyBlueBliss||40||This is of course a must see. You probably will end up here whether or not you initially intended too as there are often events and endless activities held here. When there's a sunny day, this park comes alive with sunbathers, people having picnics, smiles and laughter. It's a lovely sight. During spring all the migratory birds can be seen along the lakes edge looking for a free meal. Watch out for the squirrels.||May 16, 2018
JTclarke||40||so much walking. Right in the middle of busy streets, this paradise is truly untouched. So many walks, so much space, used for festivals and outdoor events, and why not.||May 16, 2018
HotelGuest2014||50||delightful park in the middle of London with wide speaceous walking lanes, great natural environment for different birds, squirrels , swans and in the summer is the perfect place to soak up in the sun!||May 16, 2018
concon55||40||Nice park for a walk. Not busy or over crowded. Would I recommend going? Yes. Kind of quintessential London between Buckingham and Kensington palace. ||May 16, 2018
pterryshort||50||Visited on a sunny Sunday afternoon for a chill. Good place to relax and take in who and what is around you. Beautiful gardens and lovely place to walk ||May 16, 2018
rameshsiram||50||The park is located in the heart of London and the park is very big. You have an option for the boating in the lake. Very pleasant to be there.||May 16, 2018
Corrie P||50||We walked through the park at about 9:30pm at night, without being worried of our safety. It was magical.||May 15, 2018
Tahreem A||50||I have been to Hyde Park quite a few times for walks with friends, charity walks and even boot camps! The best time in my opinion to go there is early morning or early afternoon! ||May 15, 2018
barfiner||40||I have been here many times..I believe it closes around 9pm. It's a very relaxing place to be when your beside the lake||May 15, 2018
jennypapadimitriou||50||Hyde park, is exquisitely beautiful during spring time. Take a walk, lay under a tree and relax. A great getaway from the city! ||May 15, 2018
natesmith2311||50||Hyde park is a great place to escape the buzz of the city. I usually take a foldable chair not to pay for a chair. Quiet and peaceful.||May 15, 2018
Rob G||50||Hyde Park is less formal than we expected (unlike NY Central Park). Coming from a drought area the stunning green grass was a sight for sore eyes! Great park to spend some time in.||May 15, 2018
gr872018||30||Spend some time here to take a break from seeing the other sights. Walk down to the Serpentine and watching the ducks and swans which are graceful and beautiful.||May 14, 2018
Yogananthini||40||The park is clean and very relaxing. Nice to spend time with families. There is shops where you can have some snacks. Pretty lake.||May 14, 2018
Margarida A||40||Family park with no cyclists! You can easily walk through all the park and visit Kensington Gardens as well ||May 14, 2018
cocopotisawus||40||Hyde Park is one of many London Green spaces where one can chill out from the city life relax and walk around the round pond and lake or catch a view .||May 13, 2018
_Rocket-Raccoon_2017||50||London has some amazing parks and this is definitely one of my favorites. There is so much to do and it is huge. Reading a book, going for a walk, going for a picnic or looking at the beautiful animals who live in peace and harmony with the people here. What can I say, it is such a lovely park to visit and I would recommend it to anyone! Believe me, you will not be disappointed. ||May 13, 2018
Michal S||50||amazing place right in heart of London , always full of people , however very well maitained it is nice to borrow a bike and go around the park and see all the corners :) ||May 13, 2018
Iva I||50||Beautiful park with a lot of spots to make picnic. Gardens are so nice and clean. We spent all day there. Highly recommended if you want relaxed day in London||May 13, 2018
Mark L||50||If the sun is shining grab some food, drink, a couple of friends or a good book and head for the park. Huge so plenty of spaces to relax in. ||May 13, 2018
950NikkiB||50||What a lovely park. Unfortunately when we visited it was pouring with rain but it was still lovely. There was a big map at the entrance of the park so we walked towards the Princess Diana Memorial which was nice to see. I couldn’t believe how tame the herons were, they’d just stand there very close to you as you walked past. We stopped into a big restaurant in the park and ordered a coffee and sat undercover outside to watch the wildlife across the Serpentine lake. I’d really recommend a visit here if you are in the area. I hope to come back again on hopefully a nice sunny day this time. ||May 13, 2018
steph1234x||50||Was very busy as the weather was nice but we still found somewhere to sitBoating was reasonable and enjoyable although if you can’t row don’t go as we got stuck - shout-out to the kind lady who helped ya row backWould recommend going when weather is good||May 13, 2018
P M||40||What a beautiful and peaceful part of the city. Gardens amazing, (squirrels adorable) with so many places to enjoy.||May 12, 2018
AshK07||50||My wife and I enjoyed a lengthy Friday evening stroll through Hyde Park in early May 2018 and it was an exceptionally welcome break from the hustle and bustle of city life. Londoners enjoying this serene landscape after a week of work all appeared equally relaxed. I recommend taking time for a burger and glass of wine at the outdoor restaurant on the east end of the lake. This sunny evening turned out to be high point of our trip through London!||May 12, 2018
885ramia||40||I think Hyde park is the most famous park in London, where you can walk or run while enjoying green area, fresh air and beautiful birds||May 11, 2018
milliemc2018||50||We go back every time we visit London. This is a magnificent park with beautiful trees, flowers and shrubs, etc. It is well visited by families and runners. ||May 11, 2018
Sonz999||30|| a lovely green space in the centre of London.very busy on a sunny day with chairs hard to get. Lots of activities on offer.expensive refreshment stands so it's worth taking your own with you.||May 11, 2018
naganand||50||A haven for outdoor lovers,in the heart of London,a vast green space full of birds,and lawns,trees and walking and cycling tracks.||May 11, 2018
Newinnman||30||It’s really incredible that there is such a huge park like this one, right in the middle of London.Be warned this park is huge, so it’s not a quick stroll from one end to the other.I also liked that they had dedicated lanes on the paths for walkers, which cyclists can’t/shouldn’t enter.||May 11, 2018
petercH4005JM||50||Great weather makes all the difference !!Lovely evening walk around the lake, just soaking in all of the history that is contained within, and around it.I did feel slightly guilty that I wasn't running or cycling (or even roller-skiing...never seen that before) but really enjoyed a calm relaxing walk in the middle of such a busy city !||May 10, 2018
gazzy_j||50||We walked along the paths, rented an old fashioned rowing boat in the Serpentine and dipped our feet in the Princess Diana memorial fountain......all on a blisteringly hot May afternoon.We found our time in Hyde Park was the perfect break from the heat and bustle of the city.||May 10, 2018
Aoife B||50||We have visited here many times... suitable for the whole family... If the weather is good. This place is a great spot to chill out! Worth a wonder any day! ||May 10, 2018
Trudilynwood||50||Forget the tourist bus, stroll from Victoria Station, past B/Palace, down the Mall to Trafalgar Sq. 25min walk. ||May 10, 2018
Kath5324||50||We went here on May 7th & the weather was beautiful . We had a great time here , Hyde park is lovely . We have been here before some years ago & enjoyed it so thought we would come here again .||May 9, 2018
gailwinterbottom||50||Speakers corner in Hyde park, Sunday mornings is a must! For the experience. From here you can walk to Oxford st or the other way Buckingham palace.||May 9, 2018
carlyingon||50||So we went to the Hard Rock Cafe` and decided to walk it off. Wow so big, but so pretty. An amazing park this big, really reminded me of central park but it definitely has that Victorian thing to it. You can imagine encountering Mr Darcy while you're walking through it, if only ;) ||May 9, 2018
YN_Trip||50||One of my favourite places in London, where you can have your own time, walk, drink nice coffee, watch squirrels, ducks, swans!||May 9, 2018
RHulett||50||I love this park! Great for having a chilled walk around or hiring a bike to cycle around too. In the summer it is beautiful but can get so busy! Lots of deckchairs to lay for but I prefer to lay on the grass. I can’t recommend hiring the boats enough! Is so lovely to be on the water and they are well priced I think. Great to do for an hour or so to really appreciate the park||May 8, 2018
sui_generis_man||50||I adore Hyde park. It's great for running, feeding the parakeets, strolling with a loved one, and generally enjoying life on a sunny day. Hiring a boat and paddling across the little lake is a fun way to spend an hour. ||May 8, 2018
Danuta321||40||Very big park with a nice lake and cafes. I liked it very much till my last visit. There was 28 degree yesterday and there were too many people there. We could not walk on the main footpath without touching other people. My daughter wanted to play in the playground but after a few minutes we had to go because there were many bushes and I was too tired to run all the time behind my daughter (I could not see her when she changed from one slide to another). So we decided to go to the lido to enjoy swimming... and it was not a good idea... women toilet out of order, lift out of order, paddling pool out of order, a ticket seller could not tell me if there is a stroller locker in the lido... Fortunately we found the Diana Memorial Fountain (and a few hundred people too ha ha) and we could splash and play in water having fun.||May 8, 2018
DNVGA||50||We walked through this park several times while visiting. It was really nice leaving the bustle of the city for the quiet of the park. Lovely spring visit.||May 8, 2018
JollyHolidayer||50||We were lucky enough to spend a few hours in the park on the hottest May Day bank holiday Monday on record. The park was very busy, but because it's so large it didn't feel too overcrowded.We chose to hire a bike and oh, what a wonderful experience that was. I haven't ridden a bike for over 20 years and the park is very easy to ride around/navigate with very clear signs where you are and aren't allowed to cycle. I would recommend bike hire as you get to see so much more of this wonderful park.I will bring a picnic next time!||May 8, 2018
Kostis m||50||Well i believe this is one of the best parks in UK. It is enormous.. You can see the beautiful lakes and sunbath. Very nice experience||May 7, 2018
kend407||40||Hyde Park is amazing! It is massive and takes you back to the British stories you’ve heard about it. You can walk or ride and enjoy the beautiful park.||May 7, 2018
Brian S||40||I walked through this park a few times going to different museums. It was always very busy. I was in London when the weather was sunny and warm. There were a lot of people out enjoying the weather. It seems like Londoners try and take advantage of any nice days. It is a great place to people watch. A lot of fun.||May 7, 2018
vanessakF1435GS||50||Huge park in London! Absolutely green & well kept. Wonderful to walk around in, go for a run or take a picnic. I have no idea how large it is, we only walked thru a part of it but glad we did. Not sure how it is after dark but we felt very safe and comfortable during the day. ||May 7, 2018
84suzetted||50||This massive park in London is a must see with it’s beautiful gardens, lakes and fountains! Loved the Kensington sunken garden||May 7, 2018
gabrielciuchi||50||The park is quite big. You can find some chairs to lie on, for free, under the shadow. There are not many other chairs to sit on, you can find some by the lake, though, plenty, actually. I would suggest to just lay on the grass, you can find lots, and on a sunny day, you don't need anything else. Clean, beautiful, very big park, plenty of places you can buy ice cream. ||May 7, 2018
tashspdns||50||The park is such a hive of activity and if you enjoy people watching, this is the place. The Serpentine Cafe is perfect and serves gorgeous food. Hyde Park is a place for relaxing and taking your time to absorb the atmosphere. Every year this is my simple birthday choice.||May 7, 2018
Becky-0052||50||A wonderful open public space to walk,sit, play, sleep or party with friends on a sunny day.A gem in the Heart of London ||May 7, 2018
Biggestcorey||50||Stunning park Whether walking through, having a pic nicRelaxing Just a great place to take time out in a hectic city ||May 7, 2018
Kenrharrison||50||Must see Diana memorial here. Large park with lake, swim club and much more. May want to take a walk along the pathways.||May 7, 2018
pnh20||50||Just a beautiful park that's well kept, has several options for refreshments, and lots to see including Speaker's Corner, Kensington, Italian fountains, and Marble Arch. I stopped at the Italian Cafe near the fountains which had great food if a tad overpriced. Definitely worth a stroll or run if the weather is nice.||May 7, 2018
Henrik B||40||Do stoll along this nice park with big lanes and many people.There is at big lake where you can rent boats to relaxe||May 7, 2018
POD521||40||We were there on a sunny Sunday which also happened to be a Public Holiday. The park was literally full of people almost everywhere with larger numbers closer to the water. This is obviously a much loved area of public open space. Well worth a visit when in London.||May 6, 2018
Tracey C||50||Walked through both Kensington gardens and Hyde Park on our way into the city rather than taking the tube. Lovely walk with plenty of sitting areas and cafes||May 6, 2018
rknack2017||50||Staying in the area this is a fantastic walk with so much to see plan to spend a couple of hours its well worth the time||May 6, 2018
Carol C||40||It was a nice sunny day so after walking around for hours it was lovely to sit in a deckchair in the sun. The deckchairs cost £1.80 per hour but gets less the more hours you want one for. Princess Diana memorial is a nice place to visit as well.||May 5, 2018
Siyamik||40||we visited after london eye, we walked from london eye to hyde park, it was very good experience.Hyde park is a gem in town , i never seen this big park in a city except orlando .And park was clean and green lovely park any london traveller should visit.Excellent walking area.||May 5, 2018
Mah_Murrini||40||The Albert Statue and small lake with swans make for a nice respite. The entrance to Kensington Palace is at the west end, in the middle of the north and south park entrances, and you can also visit the small but beautiful Palace Garden without a ticket to the palace. ||May 5, 2018
LindaKK2013||50||Hyde park is a lovely oasis is the heart of London. It connects so many areas, I usually walk from Queensway through to Knightsbridge much more pleasant than public transport. ||May 5, 2018
RamySabry||50||Enjoy the nature and green colors with birds and lake. Tou need to sit at the lake enjoying your coffee and the great weather. ||May 4, 2018
339334||40||Rowing isn't for everyone, but it's a good reason for coming here. You also just enjoy walking through this beautifully kept park - and perhaps on a Sunday afternoon go to Speakers' Corner.||May 4, 2018
nataliya9021||50||It is the amazing place to escape from the urban environment and enjoy walking around the park, seeing different birds, blooming flowers and listening all natures sounds||May 4, 2018
OwenTho||40||Lovely park, way bigger than you expect. Clean and tidy with paths leading everywhere and places to sit regularly dotted about. The park needs to reduce the pigeon population as they are a pain in the arm. The ducks, geese and swans are overwhelmed. trafalger Square is so much better now the pigeons have gone, Hyde Park (Serpentine) should take the same action. ||May 4, 2018
Per Henrik A||40||Get away from all the noise and traffic, just lay down in the gras or walk around in the park. Hyde Park on a sunny day is just perfect. Bring your own picnicbag or eat and drink at one of the cafes.||May 3, 2018
ARF-GF||50||Hyde Park is my favorite place to spend time on each visit to London. I enjoy walking the miles of well-maintained paths through the dell, around the serpentine and up & down the gently rolling wooded hills.||May 3, 2018
nerminegamea||50||Huge park, very nice and walking through it gives you a lot of positive energy it has a wonderful lack as well. ||May 2, 2018
Shei I||40||I went there to spend a few hours since i got one of the few sunny days in london. I walked around the lake, where you have different types of boats, and stayed around the area of the Princess Diana fountain, where there were a lot of kids playing. There is a spot for everybody, its a must in london!||May 2, 2018
Spary09||50||It was a gorgeous day so it made it all the better for this excursion. I wanted to ride a bike but couldn't find one of the rental places anywhere that wasn't behind construction tape. I walked the river and entire park. Locals have their dogs and picnics. It's a wonderful place. You can walk along the river and the trails are marvelous for running as they are NOT all concrete. If you stay on the main paths they are all easy to walk as they are asphalt. Lots of swans and saw some parrots. That was quite a shock. I guess they are now roaming the park as someone's lost pets. There was an art show going on which made it all the more enjoyable. LOTS of joggers. Great place to just hang out and enjoy the London sun. It's a huge park and adjacent to the Albert Memorial. There are a couple of restaurants inside and places to take a rest. Definitely will return. Always fun to people watch. ||May 2, 2018
Chillaxin71||50||This is a must see... After a nice meal, take your time and stroll the park. The views, the scenery are very nice. I would keep track to where you walk because in any park you can get lost. We had a wonderful time. We were lucky to have some nice weather. ||May 2, 2018
Emsalee||50||Hyde Park is a must-do when coming to London. The sheer size and beauty of a natural landscape is a stark contrast to the towering and majestic buildings that make up the bustling centre of London. There are plenty of gorgeous flowering gardens, massive shady trees and a large sprawling lake with plenty of picnicking space. There are also a number of cafes and restaurants present, allowing a wide range of variety for lunch and afternoon tea. There is the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain which is a lovely tribute to the late princess and the spray from the water is rather pleasant on a warm day.We walked a circuit through Hyde Park on our way to Kensington Palace and found it a rather lovely place. Being the middle of summer, there were quite a number of people having picnics, playing and relaxing on the hireable chairs by the lake, but there was still plenty of space for everyone and you didn’t feel crowded.As cliché as it is, it was definitely one of our favourite places and is beautiful, definitely deserving its international reputation.||May 1, 2018
fastrada||50||It was unusually warm the day we arrived in London, and we decided to kill some time here while waiting for our room in a nearby hotel to be ready for checkin. It was beautiful! Trees were in bloom, flowers were everywhere, and it was nice to get some nature in the middle of a large bustling city.||May 1, 2018
Arleen S||40||Nice walk in the park. Had lunch at Serpentine near the waterside. Park is wtoo large to see it all.||May 1, 2018
theouh88||50||Had a wonderful time exploring this beautiful park. Of course, we couldn't really cover the whole of Hyde Park during our two separate occasions in London. Lying down on the grass eating your typical "Pret a Manger" sandwich, listening to talented musicians busking their way to stardom. This was such a new experience for someone like me who lives in a busy competitive fast-paced Asian country like SG. But the highlight was definitely the Speaker's Corner. The passion and animation that the speakers had were an eye opener. Sensitive topics were discussed aggressively and openly which makes it all the more interesting. Stood there for almost an hour in the cold listening to different speakers. Will definitely do that again. FUN times!||April 30, 2018
AJ S||50||Here you can feel the nature in the center of a beautiful city. Nice views, relaxing walk among the trees and by the pond.||April 30, 2018
MajaroffS||40||When it happens and yes it does happen every now and then The sun shows it face run to Hyde park ... A very nice walk beautiful trees an amazing pond with ducks and swans ... ||April 30, 2018
arunthangavel||10||The pack was full of kids smoking cannabis and frolicking. Not please. I thought this was illegal in London||April 30, 2018
PJWallyrock||50||All we can say is Wow. Now, we never have been to the Eastern European Christmas Markets, but if the market here was an indication, then they must be terrific. This market was astounding in Hyde Park. To think that they tear this down and set it up everyear is a marvel. Tons of great food and products.This was one of our favorite activities during our visit. However, be reminded that the park is huge. We thought that it would be a leisurely walk from here to the Princess Di Memorial, but it was a hoof. To us, it was long; though at the end, we were rewarded with a reverent, but uplifting time at the Memorial.||April 30, 2018
marmi0||50||Since first time 30 years ago still a place where to walk and relaxing. The beautiful sensation of nature in the heart of a beautiful town||April 30, 2018
timetravelerruby||40||I went here twice, first to explore, second to bring nuts for the tame squirrels. A park with a wide area of grass and occasionally trees. While part I saw from the park was not sooo special (in comparison with other English gardens and parks), the atmosphere is very nice and harmonic here. Good visited, but less crowded than expected (at least the two times I have been there).||April 30, 2018
kona5150||50||I stayed near the park for one week. It was beautiful sunny days... almost all the days...I went for jogging. All all green...well maintained ,calm and quiet environment. It is a huge park at the central London. Would like to visit again.||April 30, 2018
RonL40||50||The parakeets are a treat, as are the many wading and swimming birds you'll find near the boathouse. The park is lovely on a Spring day. Plenty of different paths, great place to find a bench to do some people watching, walk along the water, watch people feeding the birds. Perfect respite from the concrete on a sunny day.||April 29, 2018
Kate B||50||Another park in London that is lovely to walk through. It's a great place to people watch and enjoy a quiet afternoon.||April 29, 2018
Snowball23514||40||I've always wanted to come to Hyde Park but never got a chance. I've finally got a chance to come here on a very hot and sunny Friday afternoon (20th April).I got off from Hyde Park Corner. I entered through the Decimus Burton's Gate and my first impression of the park was "wow", it's huge. The park has almost 350 acres and it has many crossed walking paths between those gorgeous trees. It's easy to walk as you can walk on both walking paths or on grasses. At the middle of the park, there is a lake called Serpentine where it has swans, gooses and ducks paddling and looking for the feedings from visitors. On the day I visited, there was also a couple of dogs playing with their feet inside the water too. If you're in the mood, you can also rent a pedal boat to ride on the lake for £12/person/hour or £10/ 1/2 hr (children £5/hr). There are also a cafe (Lido Bar), a restaurant (Serpentine Bar & Kitchen) and a store (Boat House) which sell coffee and tea, fish and chips, proper hot meals, ice cream, waffle and hot dogs...etc. Many people just lay down, enjoyed the picnic, sunbathing ...etc. and everyone looked so relaxing. Surprisingly, there were a lot of police everywhere which I found out later that it's due to the "World Weed Day", which thousands of organised marijuana fans flooded to Hyde Park to smoke in the sunshine. I could smell very strong marijuana and weed at every corner which meant the presence of the large police force didn't scare people off from smoking weed in the park. The other unpleasant scene was, there was quite a lot of poo floating on the Serpentine lake, (just next to the Lido Bar), which I think they should be cleared on a daily basis.Overall, Hyde Park is a wonderful park sitting right at the heart of London. Highly recommended for those who wants to escape from the noisy and busy streets. Will definitely come back.||April 29, 2018
anna_c182||50||We visited the park following the London marathon, mainly for the children’s play area for our 3 year old. She absolutely loved it, free to enter and lots of items to play on. There’s stands where you can buy food and drink also.The serpentine is good to hire a boat/pedalo, especially in nice weather.||April 29, 2018
chrissie21Yorkshire||50||Had an excellent visit here over the weekend of the London marathon. The weather was wonderful so the park was packed with visitors.||April 29, 2018
Ron H||50||Been past Hyde Park a couple of times but never took the time to go for a stroll through there. What a beautiful park! This is really a credit to the people of London, it has so much space and it has a really peaceful feel about it even with heaps of people around. Lots of splendid statues and for entertainment just near the Marble Arch there is Speakers Corner where you will find all sorts of people with all sorts of agendas spruiking their various ideas and beliefs. Nice coffee shop by the lake too.||April 29, 2018
janehthomson1||50||second time to visit in the spring. All trees blooming. Very sad that the Princess Diana memorial foutainn was not functioning.||April 29, 2018
surens340||50||My favourite morning walk destination in this huge spread out park- with the lovely Serpentine lake- the ducks quacking. The expanse of greenery- the fresh breath of air-A bit of jogging and walking- and now a relaxed Sunday!!Whats missing is the Tulips and Cherry Blossoms of Regents Park||April 29, 2018
Pája F||50||Amazing place to relax! While we were walking around we found a guy who was feeding parrots so we joined him and it was really a lot of fun. It was also surprising to see something like that. This experience was a nice way how to spend the last day of vacation||April 29, 2018
MikeChfx||30||Hyde Park is a lovely park with interesting water courses, swans, geese, ducks and other waterfowl, interesting gardens, and superb walking paths. it also has Princess Diana's Memorial Fountain. As a Canadian who lives in a suburban location with lots of access to woods and wilderness I was fascinated by the huge numbers stretched out in the park laying or sitting on the grass. We saw the same thing in St. James Park. I wondered if that was a common practice or a result of winter hibernation with exceptionally warm temperatures while I was there. In any case it was a lovely walk on the way to Harrod's!||April 28, 2018
S7133DHsaras||40||Walked from Kensington through Hyde to Marble Arch. Great walk even on a rainy cold day. Interesting landscape with lack of grooming to completely groomed areas. Worth the walk in the rain.||April 28, 2018
rickll1||40||The park is gorgeous and huge! This is a must if you are visiting London - it’s a real perk for me living so close to here. However, the pedalos are so pricey - so avoid this. Nonethless, beautiful gardens and nice cafe. ||April 28, 2018
GeroChiavari||50||Go to Hyde Park for walking, running, riding, watching the swan, ducks and all the surrounding nature. It is open from dawn to sunset.||April 28, 2018
BillNorthumberland||30||We decided to walk back to our Kensington Hotel from Oxford Street through the park. However it was roped off and I have never seen so many Police and dogs checking he grassed areas. We asked a Police Officer if there had been a serious crime only to be told that the Army were to carry out a gun salute and they had to check that it was safe. With the pressures on our Police surely the Army could have carried this task out and what were they checking for on the grass. We had to skirt this area but we still enjoyed our walk.||April 28, 2018
Davide G||50||My favourite park in London. In a sunny day it becomes just wonderful. Huge, full of art and charming, what to ask more from a park? Just go!||April 27, 2018
amandajcharles||50||Beautiful surrounds and weasy to walk around. I saw Diana's memirial pool and walked down to Kensington Palace and did a tour of the palace and the gardens. ||April 26, 2018
JIHAD40||50||Walking in London and you must end up going to Hyde park. It’s such a beautiful place with so much to see and do. You can just sit and watch people or walk around admiring the peace and quite even though your in the middle of London. A definite oasis in this beautiful city. ||April 26, 2018
MotasemA44||50||The best place to walk, run, enjoy the scenery and get any tension out of yr system Don’t miss the small lake in Kensington u will love the ducks, pigeons and goose In summer time it much colder than rest of the park||April 26, 2018
Tom A||50||A must visit if in London and you enjoy open spaces. The park is over 300 acres in size and has a fantastic number of amazing trees and scrubs. The water attracts a large number of local as well as migratory birds. The fountain dedicated to Princess Diana is beautiful, the passage of water majestic. Spent a couple of hours walking around the park and will definitely return on another visit to London.||April 26, 2018
shelleyluli||50||Beautiful park in the city, noticed the beauty even in the cold. Wish we could have listened to people's views while we were there. Hyde park is a must!||April 25, 2018
Lyanna L||30||Beautiful park with some biking trails and a pond that makes for a relaxing break from the craziness of London. Easily accessible and worth it to spend a morning running, biking, or just enjoying a cup of coffee. You can also rent small boats to paddle in the lake which is fun.||April 25, 2018
steve_vstheworld||50||It's so strange to think this sprawling, beautiful park is right in the middle of the busy city. It's a nice change of pace from the hectic London life, with plenty of nice grassy areas to explore, a huge lake to walk around or go for a bike ride, trees, birds, squirrels, and plenty of space for a picnic. You can get there from either Hyde Park Corner or Marble Arch tube stations, but you might prefer to walk down Oxford Street to do some shopping on the way.||April 25, 2018
johnmK4883LR||30||This is a city park and is good for walking or biking. There was a place to rent small boats to paddle in the lake. There were food vendors as well. Bottom line it was a city park. The Princess Diane Memorial Fountain was a huge disappointment (for what we thought it might be).||April 24, 2018
Stephen M||50||What better way to get in some exercise, while enjoying the wildlife, beautiful surroundings and fresh air.||April 24, 2018
Stavri||50||Relaxing oasis in the hard of London! Nice for a long walk or training.... beautiful flowers and birds... just visit!||April 24, 2018
Wilja_of_Lovund||40||An oasis from the busy London pace. We enjoyed a drink by the lake close to Knightsbridge Station on a beautiful warm Sunday in April. Great walk and some piece and quiet away from the city, but still in the middle of it. Loved it!||April 24, 2018
Sabah S||40||Ive been coming here for probably 18 years and Its always special to have a walk about especially in the sun.Obviously thats when its jam packed so thats the disadvantage but its lovely to see so many different people enjoy nature.||April 24, 2018
CarolineArchebaut||50||One of the best parks to visit if you are looking for a wonderful experience in nature. It's just so large and spacious that it seems never-ending. Peaceful, quiet, very clean and very well looked after. A perfect place to jog, do yoga, ride your bike, that the family out or simply have a lovely romantic stroll.||April 24, 2018
Niranarm||30||Green and spacious with jogging trail and bike trial with more than 10 Santander Bike (docking) stations to hire. However the bike trails was quite limited so it is good for exercise but if you want to cover the whole ground/attractions of the park then you will have to dismount. And don't forget to visit the Kensington Palace (Princess Diana exhibition is now closed until late April) and its garden ||April 24, 2018
2uktraveler09||50||Wonderful dogs running loose. A quiet retreat from the loud streets. very well kept up. nice and reasonalble places for tea.||April 23, 2018
matom78||50||the best thing about Hyde Park is that it is is in central London. a massive patch of green in the middle of a great city! perfect for walks and meeting friends. ||April 23, 2018
allanriley9||40||One word describes the park!! BIG! What avgreat spot but be prepared to walk yourself silly! So much to see and do! Lovely scenery and all used by thousands of people enjoying themselves. Many specific attractions in the park worth taking timevto see.||April 23, 2018
Jade S||50||I really love Hyde Park. When walking around ti does't feel like your in the middle of London. Every time I come to London I make sure I visit. Especially at Christmas time, it's really beautiful and well worth a visit any time of year.||April 23, 2018
alexkuznets0v||50||Great place to walk alone, or with family, or with friends! It is just lovely place to spend some time||April 23, 2018
EADargue||30||We dipped our toes an the Diana Princess of Wales memorial fountain and walked to the serpentine. Picnic on the grass. Park was busy but still lots of open space to enjoy. Bikes, boats, jogging tracks, cafes and toilets.||April 22, 2018
christopher m||40||Took a "Boris" bike for an hour cruising round Hyde Park. Easy, uncomplicated and relatively cheap system for hiring a bike by the half hour. We had an hour and covered most of Hyde Park on a lovely sunny spring day. Almost flat so an option for everyone. Good break from the intensity of most London attractions, though a bit busy at weekends.||April 22, 2018
F9182DNelenac||50||I love this park especially in April and May when all the daffodils and roses are blooming. Truly an oasis in the middle od London||April 22, 2018
mariorI8749IT||20||Some trees, some gardens but overall just a big expanse of flat, boring, grassland. Toilets are hard to find and you have to stroll the all damn thing to find one (better taking a pee by one of the endless plain paths). No big deal, NYC Central Park just spank it mercilessly.||April 22, 2018
Graeme W||50||First time I have really explored the park and it is fantastic to sit and watch the world go by, loads of nature and exhibits to view.||April 22, 2018
Eran H||40||This is a nice walk for a good weather day. Don't forget to view the Princess Diana memorial on your walk. ||April 22, 2018
FeetinDaSand||50||This is a beautiful park surrounded by city. Lots of open spaces. And walkways. It feel very safe in this park. Lots of wonderful statues and monuments and waterways. The statue of Peter Pan is adorable. There is a massive monument to Prince Albert that you cannot miss.Nice for a pleasant walk on a sunny day||April 22, 2018
yariemke||50||Hyde Park is gianourmous!!! If you really want to see it all you need to rent a bike. Green everywhere you look, lakes, hidden sweet little cafes and bars, ducks and swans -just beautiful. Bring your blanket and a picnic basket and you're set for the day.||April 21, 2018
kennethbarker||50||It was one of the hottest days of the year as we strolled through Hyde Park. Those that were lucky or organised were soaking up the sun in unusually high temperatures dotted around on the grass. Those people who had arrived with a picnic were already seated, basket at the ready. People were queuing for food and drink and there was a separate long queue to take boats out onto the Serpentine. There was yet another queue for the public toilets. Some tree blossom was out and the flower beds were a riot of colour. Parakeets are much more exotic than we expected in Hyde Park. They were feeding on nuts and apples and were bold enough to take the food from outstretched hands. The grey squirrels seemed put out by the parakeets and were trying to get our attention. The view through Henry Moore’s sculpture “The Arch” across the Serpentine was excellent right through to Kensington Palace.||April 21, 2018
shereewhite57||50||Wonderful to walk through or just sit and take in the surroundings, Lots of interesting statues and history as well as Kensington Palace||April 20, 2018
Vincent D||50||King Henry 'The Villain' VIII stole this park from the Monks of Westminster Abbey who owned it as a revenue earner for the church. This illegal act should be properly punished. However today the park does provide Londoners with a place to let their hair down - or to exercise their horses. ||April 20, 2018
Atlas R||50||A must visit when the weather is good in London. Park is very nice indeed and brings a breath of fresh air to heavily poluted london||April 20, 2018
135alisterm||50||We had a very enjoyable stroll through Hyde Park during the warm weather this week, there is lots to see and do from sailing on the Serpentine Lake or visiting The Princess Diana memorial to just enjoying nature in these beautiful surroundings.Certainly worth a visit for a leisurely stroll.||April 19, 2018
davemurphy77||40||A really beautiful and large park right in the middle of London. Heaps of exploring, playgrounds and activities to keep the kids entertained. Well worth visiting the Princess Diana memorial fountain and paddling on the Serpentine on a warm day. On a warm, clear day the park has a tremendous atmosphere and is well worth spending a few hours at when sight seeing in London.||April 19, 2018
KJ_and_G||50||Let's hope that Hyde Park is kept as a park forever. It's a huge space with lots of things to do, and hosts some tremendous summer events.||April 19, 2018
jackg641||50||We recently spent a full day in Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens walking among the spring flowers, enjoying the many varieties of birds (including ring-necked parakeets, rowing on The Serpentine, visiting the Albert Memorial, the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain and the Italian Gardens and having afternoon tea at the Pavilion at Kensington Palace (the Orangerie is currently being extensively renovated). It was a lovely way to escape the bustle of London for a day.||April 18, 2018
kamiahkid||40||Go by bike! The park is beautiful and can be covered by riding a bike, which you can rent at several stations throughout the park and surrounding neighborhoods. You can park the bike and then enjoy the areas that are off limits to riding.||April 18, 2018
RiiiShaaa||50||Went here for a walk, and it's wonderful in the summertime! There's a reason why this is such a popular place - it's great to stroll around amidst nature!||April 18, 2018
Colin P||50||Beautiful, especially in these warm summer evenings. It's great to sit and people watch.The park can be utilised for so many things, running,walking,sleeping,reading,picnics, exploring the many aspects of the park. It has something for everyone.I recommend the middle section neat the George memorial, opposite the Albert Hall. This is a lovely section.||April 17, 2018
imanmarafie||50||Kids loved the ducks and had a great time on the boat, my kids are 5 and 2 so if you’re deciding to go on the boat keep it to 30mins and no longer, kids tend to get bored easily, as for us we didn’t even finish the 30 minutes ride.||April 17, 2018
sillyhilly74||50||Nipped through Hyde Park on a visit to Harrods. Peace and tranquility in busy city....great place for chilling out and catching your breathe.....nice and clean ||April 17, 2018
Saurabh B||50||One of the best places in London to spend a weekend afternoon with family and kids in the midst of nature. It is free and easily accessible from London underground trains and bus. You can carry your food. Great place for little children to fee ducks, run around, ride cycle and skate bike. You can rest on benches or carry your own mat to rest on the ground and read a book or hear music in the midst of nature and good crowd around you.||April 17, 2018
Sherif M||50||The park was outside my hotel. When the family met I just took them across and we all had a lovely time strolling through the park.||April 17, 2018
Ian M||40||We had a walk through Green park over to Buckingham palace, we then walked up to Hyde park, seen prince Harry (honestly true) then walked over the road to Hyde park. reminded me of central park in New york, really clean and bright, loved it.||April 17, 2018
Miguel Enrique B||50||My wife and I went for a stroll at hide park on a Saturday morning and we felt in love with the atmosphere of it. You can spend hours walking and looking at people, animals and enjoying the London breeze while thinking of all the amazing chapters in history written at this park. A must in London!||April 16, 2018
780RobertC780||50||Hyde Park is simply a beautiful part that is right up there with Central Park in NYC. Even in the evening, its a great safe location.||April 16, 2018
sivmee||50||Great paek with alot of animals and different birds. A great place to just relax and enjoy. Recommande to have a picnic:) Only negative..Very few toilets.. so people were pissing in the bushes behind us.||April 15, 2018
854DP||40||Walk along one of the many paths that weave through the park.Enjoy the shade of an old tree or admire the the flowers all year around. Paddle in the lake or take a boat out, so much to do in this large open space!||April 15, 2018
Sbentley292||50||really enjoyed the walk through Hyde Park, so many happy people and happy dogs! Came across fearless parakeets landing on peoples' hands to eat apples!! How cool! Beautiful flowers in areas. Lovely place to take a stroll.||April 15, 2018
Bross24||50||Lovely park to take a stroll thru. Lots of trees are in bloom, birds, ducks and swans looking for handouts. Young and old couples holding hands, sitting on benches talking to each other and if solo they were often still chatting away and I was not always sure if they were talking to them self or had Bluetooth.||April 15, 2018
Annie F||50||Do yourself a favour and rent a Santander bike and cycle your way around Hyde Park. It’s a beautiful park with plenty happening and lots to see regardless of the weather! ||April 15, 2018
Jedlynny||50||We went for a walk in Hyde Park yesterday 15/04/2018 which was the first sunny day of Spring in London. It was a joy to see people laughing and smiling. Lapping up the sun on deckchairs. Children playing and laughing. People tatking of coats, scarves and Jackets to soak up the rays.A beautiful day indeed.||April 15, 2018
Stephen M||50||That was sunny day and we have a fun with our son. Great park to spend the day and enjoy with family. ||April 15, 2018
W3634YVsamm||30||A place to meet, a venue to host or a space to breathe but not a place to target in its own right. Essential green lawn and trees but in a strange way nicely left as a stretch of green when not completely reconfigured too host one of many excellent events throughout the year.||April 15, 2018
ahs4y||50||Next to Knightsbridge and Marble Arch, two great shopping areas, good for a break and R&R between shopping and sight-seeing.||April 14, 2018
Catherine R||50||If you are looking for a fun and cheap activity, i can't recommend enough hiring a Boris Bike and cycling through the park. The views are wonderful, the cycle paths well maintained and flat easy riding. It feels like you are in the middle of the countryside not the middle of the city. Perfect day with a picnic!||April 14, 2018
YazzanSh||50||Large park with lots of things to see, very quiet and would visit againThere is a coffee shop or two is the park in case you want to have a drink while walking or just want to relax beside the lake||April 14, 2018

koenhilven||40||My girlfriend and me took a lovely stroll through the different parks in London and this one is definitely worth visiting! ||April 13, 2018
heatherjordan56||50||After a long flight, we needed to get some fresh air to fight jet lag and this was perfect! There are statues, birds, dogs playing, green grass, flowers, water...It is just lovely. If you are looking for a relaxing time with great photo opportunities and plenty of walking options this is the place! Beautiful!||April 12, 2018
jbA5000PG||30||Spacious greenery for LondonVisited the Diana memorial ..disappointing (personal opinion). Speakers corner and marble archPedloes available on serpentine if you want to have a go!||April 12, 2018
71bgc||50||My son and I were on a 14 hour layover in London. We had walked from the theatre district back to Paddington station through Hyde Park. Despite the pouring rain (no light drizzle), it was still beautiful. It was just us and the water fowl. ||April 12, 2018
hiddenvacation||40||Hyde Park, the biggest of the Royal Parks in London’s west central region, is and of itself a remarkable gift of lush open green space but importantly it also acts as a vital link with the other nearby parks including, St James Park and Green Park on its east side and finally Kensington Gardens on its West boundary. This splendid connection of excellent parks makes it possible for one to meander from the gates of Buckingham Palace to the magnificent statue of Queen Victoria in front of Kensington Palace. It is not so much the facilitating of getting from Point A to Point B but rather thoroughly enjoying all the beautifully delicate points in between. Along the vibrant paths in Hyde Park one can encounter security on horse back, a flourishing Dell, the bustling Serpentine Lake with benign boat traffic, clusters of the most most remarkable flower beds imaginable, lined trees standing century, The Memorial Fountain for Diana, The Princess of Wales and Serpentine Bridge leading to Kensington Gardens and the Famous Palace there.Hyde Park is a remarkable gift.||April 12, 2018
1Nick_B36||50||The weather wasn’t great when we went but it is a beautiful and relaxing place. We are sandwiches here and looked at the water! Worth a visit if you like parks. ||April 12, 2018
brentwoodmom48||40||Would recommend renting bicycles to enjoy the space. Be sure to follow the signs where cycling is allowed. ||April 11, 2018
ShelbyMadden||40||When we were walking to find our hotel we had to cut through Hyde Park, and it is literally massive it'd take well over an hour to walk fully around it, but it is beautiful and great for picnics and a bike ride. I also went during Winter Wonderland and recommend people go during winter to see it. A bit spooky walking through it at night though, don't recommend doing by yourself as there's literally no lampposts/lights at all. ||April 11, 2018
Hamoodals||50||I feel having inner peace in this place... love it to death.. very clean, relaxing and breath taking||April 11, 2018

lucysnell||40||Visited Hyde Park a couple of years back to see an Arctic Monkeys concert, it was packed, the busiest I'd ever seen an event that wasn't a festival. Close to a couple of tube stations so pretty easy to get to and from, and of course, a mass of bus stops too.||April 10, 2018
foi5002||50||A beautiful green space in the heart of London. Nice walks, cafes, boating lake and the Lady Diana Memorial garden all feature.||April 10, 2018
Benitta||50||A lovely safe and peaceful place to stroll and let the kids run wild after being in the confine of a to be station!

Sphynxeye||50||We rented some bicycles and we saw all the spots of this great park in London, a nice place to relax in the nature. We also saw the Kensington Palace.||April 10, 2018
Goddessmoonlady||50||Hyde Park was my favorite place to just wander and wind down from the hustle and bustle that is London. It's an amazingly serene space perfect for walking, jogging, biking, or ever riding horses! Plus in the winter the park hosts a "Winter Wonderland" a full blown carnival with games, food, little shops, and rides that has free admission.||April 9, 2018
pup83slg||40||We enjoyed running through the park but also taking time to look at the many sites such as the Princess Diana memorial garden, the many statues, Marble Arch, Kensington Palace, wild life etcRelaxing place that has a lot to offfer , go at your own pace ||April 9, 2018

Greig R||40||We were in London for a three day midweek city break and went for a walk in the park. Nice wide pavements but watch out for the cyclists. Went to speakers corner to listen to the people on their soapboxes but we were too early, depending on which way you are walking check out marble arch, stunning! ||April 9, 2018

Karwendel52||50||First Hyde Park run with our oldest daughter; the highlight of our London vacation for both of us. We were there the first few days of April 2018 and found the park very green; roses and primroses in bloom everywhere. Close enough for us to run there and back easily from the Park Plaza Victoria where we stayed. ||April 8, 2018
888anthony||40||Early in the day walking in Hyde Park is rather like being in the middle of the country and my dogs love the experience. There is never any litter and the only risk are bicyclists going too fast which can take one by surprise. The afternoons tend to be quite crowded especially on fine days but it is still possible to get off the beaten track. We should be proud of all our London parks which are so much better than most of their global counterparts.||April 8, 2018
estermariae||50||Biggest park in london. I would recommend getting a bike and biking through the park! It can get very busy in the summer though!||April 8, 2018

HiTrevor||40||Of course, the zoo is there. Aside from that there is a large pond, flower beds and many bird species. A good place to spend an hour on a dry day.||April 8, 2018
AmyC101||50||Naturally Hyde Park is the place to visit during Spring when the floral and fauna bloom. Tip: For nature lovers and photography enthusiasts, add Serpentine Lake to your list. If you’re patient, you’ll be rewarded. ||April 8, 2018
Paul P||50||This was a nice surprise. A park close to my hotel. I spent three hours there the day I arrived. It was clean with many different trails and the lake was very nice. Lots of families and birds to look at. It’s one of three parks near Buckingham palace. I would visit it again.||April 7, 2018
Paul L||50||A great place to take a relaxing break from the hustle and bustle of the City. A picnic or coffee and snacks from the various kiosks. Only downside is the expensive and filthy toilets||April 7, 2018
Menekag||50||Lovely to have a picnic in summer. It is a little green paradise right in the middle of the city. Lovely water features and walking paths to stroll along. Lots of space for kids to run around and play ages.||April 7, 2018
Paula C||50||This place is just a quintessence of what park should be, with it's lake, running path and endless walking paths it's a green heart of London and located very central too. Great for runners!||April 7, 2018
YogiShar||50||Great day out.Fresh air, boats on the river, swans, watching roller blading, long walk through the park. Lots to do.If the weather is good, bring a ball and your roller skates.We didnt do the boats this time round. Its worth doing if you are feeling fit.||April 7, 2018

mohitlohani||50||Hyde Park is city's central, near-squarish mile long park with two large lakes, tourist spots of Kensington Palace & memorials of Lady Diana and King Albert and of course, shaded and landscaped avenues occasioned by regular Londoners and tourists.||April 7, 2018
MummyDen||50||Headed to the Science Museum, followed by Hyde Park, coming in from the South East corner of the park. We were headed to the Princess Diana Pirate Ship which is located in the North West side of the park. We went via the huge pond in the middle that has lots of ducks, swans, etc. Then headed to Baywater for some lunch before heading home. A huge park. Bring a picnic!||April 6, 2018
Cerveira_Pinto_Jr||40||Remarkable at ease of the animals in this park. We went to see the Guard shift change and came back to the city via the park. Tons of squirrels, ducks, gooses, etc.. Excellent Photo Ops.||April 6, 2018

Cesare D||50||One of the best spot to relax from the rushing city. If you need to detox from your work, your study or during your vacation, go to Hyde Park and regenerate near the lovely lake. It is also a great choice to jog or ride your bike. Enjoy!!!||April 4, 2018
mouseHerts||50||There is a whole range of birds and wildlife to see in the park, but the Egyptian geese are particularly pretty. We saw 6, but I am sure there are more. It's a lovely park to walk around, you can also boat on the Serpentine and even swim in it, in the summer, however the water didn't look that appealing.||April 4, 2018
Lalaelle||50||Lovely park full of wildlife and great place to people watch too, the Parakeets were entertaining us and a lovely heron was posing for all the cameras. ||April 4, 2018
oscarposh||50||The lakes, the avenues, the memorials and beautiful large open space in the middle of London just has to be done, regardless of the time of year.If you are early enough, the Household Cavalry exercise their horses through the park, quite a spectacle.||April 4, 2018

CindyLou2013||50||Hyde Park is the real life going by part of London. Walking, jogging, horse riding, bicycling, dog walking, short cuts across the Park & no cars. It is just so peaceful to see the gardens in full natural seasonal bloom. The daffidils & crocuses were everywhere. If you miss your dog at home you will see many to commune with & talk to their owners/locals. A flock of large bright green parakeets have adapted & made Hyde Park their home. Cute, very vocal, great photos. Rain or shine it just feels really good to walk thru the ever changing Park, and even meet some locals to talk to. Found Londoners are very friendly & willing to share their favorite places around. If you are lost they have no problem pulling out their cell phone directions for you.||April 3, 2018

Michael G||40||Went for a run and circled the park. Tons of wildlife. Small swimming area. Not too busy. Swans, ducks and geese. Beautiful flowers and fountains. ||April 3, 2018
Adam Q||30||Central park in NYC is way better! this park is full of deadbeats masking for cash or cigarettes. certain areas are ok, but with such terrible weather and stuff like that, it's a drag.||April 3, 2018
rafaeljamiranda||50||The park is huge and you can walk a lot, there is a nice lake near Kensington Palace. During Christmas you can go to Winter Wonderland, one of the biggest events in London.||April 3, 2018
ice_la_strega||50||Hyde Park is a must see in London, just for a quick walk or a pic nic in a sunny day, it’s beautiful and it’s feel hundreds km from the city! ||April 3, 2018
Linda O||50||The park is a wonderful sight in the middle of London with the Serpantine and the ducks, the squirrels and the wild parakeets, you can get something to eat and drink and there are toilets. ||April 3, 2018
Dawn C||50||The hotel we stayed in was on the edge of Hyde Park so we walked through the park many time during our stay in London, both the enjoy the park itself and to walk through it to get to museums, restaurants and Harrod's. The swans in the pond are beautiful! We loved seeing so many people walking their dogs through the park (we were missing our dogs back home).||April 2, 2018
Mr. John L||40||If you do visit Hyde Park, go and see Diana's memorial. They did a very good job and it was worth visiting it.||April 2, 2018
aldanmikol||50||If you are going to walk in one park in London during your visit, it should be this one. We spent the better part of the afternoon walking this park. The weather was warm and the leaves your going through their fall colour changes making the views breathtaking. We started at Wellington Arch and walked to see Achilles statue, the Holocaust Memorial Gardens, Princess Diana Fountain, Albert Memorial, Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace. On the return, we walked along the northern part of the park to Marble Arch. A very relaxing and enjoyable day. ||April 2, 2018
Not-too-picky-in-CT||50||Huge beautiful park.Visited the Albert monument and the Diana Memorial. Lots of waterfowl to watch s well. Very clean and well maintained. A must visit. ||April 2, 2018

juliebergh||50||A walk through (and better yet an extended visit) to Hyde Park is a must for every traveler! It is like visiting London's communal backyard with barbeques, picnics, soccer games, dogs, people relaxing and enjoying the day! It feels so far away from the hustle and bustle of London and yet you are right there! This is a must stop for us whenever we are in town!||April 2, 2018
kerry h||50||Lovely large area with clear paths for walking, exercising or just sitting watching the world go by, if the weather is good. Diana memorial is worth a visit very tranquil.||April 2, 2018
vandebergmaud||30||Yeah yeah, it's a hyde park, but still - now it's just a park. Don't expect any great speaches anymore in there. Wide and open.||April 2, 2018
2madstaffs||50||Great to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, sit and feed the animals, grab an ice cream or a £4.50 hotdog, watch out for pick pockets||April 2, 2018
johndurmond||50||I have the fortune of being able to walk through the park for part of my commute and on a sunny day it's a very nice walk. Definitely recommend whether you're a Londoner like me, or a tourist looking for a simple relaxing walk - Hyde Park on a sunny day always seems to do the trick for me.||April 1, 2018
936douglasw||50||I loved this park . Such a wonderful public space to sit and relax. I would love to have spent more time here||April 1, 2018
kamelaldeirawy||50||Excellent open space in the city to relax, if a person wonders around he could find a lot of interesting monuments||April 1, 2018
dogKent||50||We had our morning stroll through the park and it's always so immaculately kept and great for people watching, nice to see the horses out to and we found a fantastic hideaway to have a amazing breakfast at only £7.50 each , it's at the south end of the park right by the entrance ||April 1, 2018
EarthlingA||40||Love this place when the sun's out and the sky's blue and clear. Makes every photo that you snap looks good, especially by the pond with the swans and different species of ducks! There's a cafe and a sakura tree near the Italian fountain too! :)||March 31, 2018
Anders386||40||Tourist and locals at the same time, a lot of nice dogs running in the fields and also some running people, horses, swans and other animals.||March 31, 2018
135DavidS135||40||Clearly one of the best parks in the world. Lots of places to chill, see the wildlife and just…relax. Beautiful, a real oasis in an amazing city.||March 31, 2018
tksglant||40||Walking in this park is exactly what I pictured from all those 1700 novels where Lords and Ladies of the ton did all their socializing. It's beautiful! If there were a horse and carriage ride I would've done it. ||March 31, 2018
Te3ma||50||Every corner of Hyde Park offers something different in terms of views and places to visit. Go to the Serpentine Lake for a stroll or hire a boat, enjoy feeding the birds or stroll through the scenic parks and gardens. Cross over to Kensington Park and visit the Gallery or play tennis. No other park quite matches up to Hyde Park and it’s beauty!||March 30, 2018
Annie51_13||40||The vast open space in the middle of the city is superb. There are many monuments to see particularly the Albert Memorial which is stunning. We walked through to the Albert Hall, the Science Museum and the underground.||March 30, 2018
CBow1es||50||Spacious. Well looked after. Great for kids and dogs to run around safely. Different parts to explore and enjoy. Very accessible.||March 30, 2018
LondonerAbroad29||50||There is no better park to run or cycle around in London. This park is truly stunning and very large with a lot of sub areas to enjoy and food and drink near the bridge. ||March 29, 2018
victoriae3579||40||Stumbled upon this park after visiting the Prince Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall. Did not realize the park was directly in front of Kensington Palace, so that was also a nice sight to see. It was very cold outside when I went and strolled by, but I can only imagine it is more beautiful in warmer weather. The pond with all the birds was a sight to see, the swans were gorgeous.||March 29, 2018
982victorh||50||The only thing more impressive then how beautiful the park is. Was how clean the park is kept. Lots of wildlife including the squirrel who ran up begging for food.||March 29, 2018
Discerning-intrepid||50||History, riding, boating, tennis, gardens, water features, entertainment space, winter wonderland, Speskers' Corner. Wonderful space in the heart of the world's best city. ||March 29, 2018
thepik||40||This place is huge!We visited and walked around the park. Not much to see on the grounds except the Princess Diana fountain that was placed in her memory. The park is overly large so make sure you plan what entrance and exit you want to use.Worth checking out on a nice day!||March 29, 2018
tanialatinina||40||This park is very big and nice.. There's a jogging track in there.. So you can enjoy jogging... Also there's a lake with a very beautiful swan which know when you come to see them. So they will come to you if you stand or sit near the lake... Very beautiful... Kensington palace (lady diana palace) is in this park.. There's also lady diana playground and memorial fountain||March 28, 2018
TravelLightOften||40||Chilly, cloudy day in London. There were many dogs off lead here, and some sort of dog club meeting near the Serpentine Gallery (warm bathrooms but strange hip exhibits). We saw mostly locals and families. We proceeded to Round Pond, where people were renting remote controlled miniature sailboats. The crowds picked up near Kensington Palace, a brick building which looked pretty dreary. The gift shop/cafe was packed with tourists. Skipped the expensive entry and exited the park.||March 28, 2018
meadowgrove4||40||suck a nice place to walk, view the birds and all the other people. Would be spectacular later in the spring or summer.||March 28, 2018
MariamM2185||50||Wonderful place and beautiful yard full of grass and birds. There are some cafe served coffee and some appraisers. Running is the famous sport people do here. ||March 28, 2018
Aussie_Tourist79||50||We visited in both summer and winter. Summer is a great time to wonder through the park. Enjoy the flowers and the many opportunities for different experiences. Our favourite was grabbing an ice cream and sitting in the park. Winter there is plenty going on with October fest and winter wonderland.||March 28, 2018
E7371KTmelm||30||I much preferred Hampstead Heath or even Regent's Park, although it's okay in the wintertime, for Winter Wonderland||March 27, 2018
Timmy B||50||A walk through Hyde Park on a Sunday ia a great way to spend the afternoon. Stop and have a coffee and a burger and admire the wildlife... ||March 27, 2018
SchmidtBerliner||50||Hyde Park is such a wonderful and beautiful space to take time out of a busy day in London. It’s so big & grand, you can feel the history in the trees. And I love the idea of the kings of England hunting on horseback through it.||March 27, 2018
Ashleigh S||50||Hyde park is beautiful and very vast in size. We took a very long walk from Buckingham Palace through the park to our hotel which was closer to Kensington Palace. It was very enjoyable with many paths, gardens, benches, etc. We really enjoyed seeing every day people with their dogs using the areas as it reminded us of our pup back home. I would definitely recommend a stroll to anyone.||March 27, 2018
360sharifg||40||Hyde park is pleasant but if you are sight seeing it only needs about an hour, if that!It's a pleasant park and worth visiting padding through...Though in summer it's amazing!||March 27, 2018
Jess C||50||huge and beautiful park, great to go with my kids. they enjoy running around! it has a big lake where you can rent a boat, we did it and it was a lovely experience!||March 26, 2018
LovesLastShift||50||So much to do and see ... the trees are so grand, Big and I bet its so beautiful when the trees are in full bloom. We hired out bikes to view the park faster there is a split in the pathway for pedestrians and cyclists there is also a cafe but we didnt catch it in time before it closed so unfortunately i didnt get to try it out||March 26, 2018
katiecarr1901||50||Stayed close to the park for a weekend, it is a lovely well kept park. It is well sign posted so easy to navigate with lovely fountains and ponds. If you dislike dogs it may not be the place for you as a lot of dogs playing and out for walks. ||March 26, 2018
USEuroTraveler1977||50||You must must must walk Hyde Park. From the Princess Diana memorials to the ponds and wildlife. It is peaceful and beautiful. Pack a picnic and enjoy a beautifully wonderful afternoon to relax. ||March 25, 2018
tommyDFTL1||50||This park is an awesome place to walk around, enjoy the fresh air and see some of the great pieces of London history. We walked almost the entire park. The fountain dedicated to Diana, Princess of Wales is an amazingly peaceful experience and just a short walk away is Kensington Palace. The park is very dog friendly and in the summer months you can rent the paddle boats on the lake. If you like outdoor activities, this is one not to be missed while in central London! ||March 25, 2018
davenylas||50||Loved this get away from the busy city and traffic to take the little ones to do something active. The park has a large pond with multiple swans/ducks to feed although no one is there selling anything to feed the birds so BYOB. Also has a huge park for kids named after Queen Diana that the kids loved. Got some good energy out to the then go and do some more tourist like things. There is even a small cafe next to the park in case of needs for a snack or otherwise. ||March 25, 2018
nakkone||50||It’s always nice to walk around Hyde park. Today we saw a couple of singing parakeets in the trees! It’s a great place to go for a short/long stroll, especially in the nice weather.||March 24, 2018
Vacationer728572||50||How nice to have such a perfect and vivid park in the middle of a big city.. a green place full of cultural and open air activities for all... Just perfect ||March 24, 2018
Ranis555||40||We were two and we needed a place to just chill for a bit! We sat by the lake and watched the swans while drinking our tea. It is such a beautiful park, an amazing place for an improvised pic-nic, to drink a tea with a friend or even to just appreciate the view. Had a lovely afternoon! ||March 24, 2018
TravellingTracyS||50||We visited here to visit the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. This park is very large, so make sure if you aren't spending lots of time here, you figure out where you wan to visit and get dropped off there. There is a nice cafe with bathrooms near the memorial fountain and we walked there. It was nice to sit and see the swans swimming. From there we were able to walk to Kensington Palace. ||March 23, 2018
Buckeye_Ryan||30||Nice place for a walk and a bit of green while in the city. Lots of dogs and joggers. Kensington Palace at one end is a close attraction.||March 23, 2018
Annamaria P||50||Speakers' corner was establishedin 1872 as a place of unbridled free speech. Including Kensington Gardens, the Park covers about one square mile and contains a number of interesting monuments and statues.||March 23, 2018
Letitiamm13||50||No matter what the weather it's always beautiful and fun to go to Hyde Park. I have hired bikes to cycle around the park, had a picnic while listening to a concert and of course the traditional visit to Winter Wonderland around Christmas is a must see||March 23, 2018
Alan S||50||The lush green gardens, the wildlife .. I mean ducks and other birds.. friendly squirrels are a pleasure to see and play with. Great photo opportunity. This is the Royal gardens, just off Buckingham palace. We generally sit down and have a picnic here with the best views of London. If you are lucky, you will also get to see flamingo's here. There are a couple of food stalls where you get some food and drink.in a sunny day will be very nice to take a walk and relax||March 22, 2018
frozz l||50||i also had the time to feed the ducks with the kids, lovely day out!fantastic relaxing . quite a lot of new places where to refresh yourself there too||March 22, 2018
Kari C||50||I was wanting to go to Hyde park forever. To see the Princess Diana memorial fountain was a dream come true. To know that at one time she walked this park was just so touching. Kensingtons Palace is in the park and a must see too||March 21, 2018
nkftravels||40||Being a Londoner I know this park quite well and is a common pick to meet up in the summer! On really sunny days it does get really busy with hardly a spot of grass lol but there is always somewhere to throw a blanket down :) it's still nice to go and stroll and see the water. You can also get a paddling boat, small cafe and ice cream stalls.||March 21, 2018
Anziri||50||What a wonderful park! Joggers, children, dogs, birds, seniors, tourists and locals all enjoying the beautiful spring weather the day we visited. Very well-trained dogs were running loose but never far from their owners. We visited an art gallery right on the grounds and walked through beautiful gardens. Park benches were well spaced throughout. Never saw so many swans in one place. A truly delightful day in a very clean and safe park.||March 21, 2018
Christine S||50||Amazing park in busy London and a must see on any visit! Lots of people watching and beautiful sections to explore!||March 21, 2018
jeffchia88||40||Nothing really blooms in winter, not a place to visit in the cold months.Lovely to photograph silhouettes of trees in the evening and setting sun during winter.||March 21, 2018
KLE2013||50||A royal park since Henry XIII dissolved the monasteries in 1536 and opened to the public by James I in the early 1600's, Hyde Park is the green heart of London. On every visit to the city we always enjoy time in Hyde Park particularly a stroll by the lovely Serpentine Lake. Our experience was quite different on our visit last November as the Winter Wonderland holiday festival was in full swing. With Ferris wheels, amusement rides for children and multiple locations for eating, drinking and shopping, the atmosphere of the festival was certainly family oriented. Admittance to the festival grounds was free, with tickets for rides and refreshments on sale at the site. Although a brisk day, the holiday merriment was certainly warm and wonderful.||March 21, 2018
susannec268||50||I always enjoy a walk through the park, whichever season. Look at the birds and squirrels. If your lucky you can hand feed one!||March 21, 2018
_rp_dv||50||Nicely maintained park in London, probably this is one of the not many places where you can get some fresh air in London. The park has a nice lake where you can go paddling. I would also suggests rent a bike so you can ride around the park. It also host a wide range of events such as concerts on the summer and the winter wonderland over the winter. It is easily accessible by public transport and it's close to many attractions such as Oxford street, Buckingham palace and the Royal Albert Hall. ||March 20, 2018
WalsallIan||40||This as to be the best park in London for me;what ever time the year you comeA nice walk can be spent taking in what the park as to offer with a stunning view ofRoyal Albert Hall as well||March 20, 2018

Caz N||50||Have been coming here for years, a haven of peace and nature in London, Kensington Gardens, Orangery, the lake, the openness, truly beautiful||March 18, 2018
MrPKI||40||It is very popular due to its size for walkers and runners. You can easily sneak in a 10K run without running the same paths. The only downside right now is all the landscaping work which is restricting some paths and it makes it a little ugly right now.||March 18, 2018
L1507ZLgemmab||50||First time in Hyde Park and enjoyed it. We got a good day which helped. Enjoyed walking about and even with the amount of people was quiet and relaxing. Plenty of wee cafes for food and drink. Very clean. ||March 18, 2018
260annmariem||50||Hyde park is amazing, whether it’s the middle of summer or the middle of winter it is always full of people from every walk of life and really is a hive of activity! There are bike and pedestrian paths throughout, a beautiful lake and an amazing and pretty secure play area for the kids died with wonderful things such as teepees, a pirate ship, swings, slides and sand as well as so much more! There is also a cafe which is a little pricey but well worth the money, food and drinks were perfect! I would definitely recommend Hyde park, great for picnics, walks and family days out!||March 17, 2018
991niav||50||What a lovely park to rejoice and recharge, there's plenty of areas to explore whether solo or with loved ones. Be camera ready for the swans !!||March 17, 2018
MaryiamS||40||Hyde park is beautiful whenever you go. Perfect for picnics in the summer or beautiful walks in Autumn. It is a little too built up for my liking, but there are parts that haven't been manicured... and that is just perfect for a walk.Stay away from Hyde park corner or Marble arch during winter wonderland though. It's just awful!||March 17, 2018
backendofbeyond||50||I recommend a visit to Hyde Park as it is a lovely, open, green space that is relaxing to walk around or even just go and have a sandwich on a bench in.If you live in London or are staying for a while, there are walking groups that take in a whole circuit and that is a great way to keep fit, make friends and appreciate the space.Lots to see and look at even if you take in an hour's worth of walking.Sure, it can get busy, but keep walking, the crowds thin out away from the entrances and it has always felt utterly safe to me.There is the Diana Memorial fountain, Speaker's Corner, the statue of Achilles, fountains, memorials galore, the birds on the lake itself, the Serpentine. Food and drink around the place is a bit expensive, so I would take something with you to enjoy once there.||March 17, 2018
nikoletam85||50||I really love this park is large with water view wildlife swans, ducks. Great place to fo in nice sunny days to enjoy nature.||March 16, 2018

Michee9441||50||This place is worthy if you like walking, talking and relax yourself with a great person on your side. It is really romantic and the lake is amazing. ||March 14, 2018
Jasmine S||40||I love the squirrels that are just everywhere, probably don't recommend that you feed them tho because of diseases.||March 14, 2018
Elbows29||50||I run around the park regularly when visiting London. The loop around the outside (within the park) is about 4 miles, so you can lap as much as you like to make up your miles. There are plenty of routes through the park and lots to see to make it interesting if you want to.At night only parts are lit, so I go onto the paths around the outside just in case. There are still a lot of people/cyclists at dusk within the park but I don’t run inside after dark - although it may be perfectly safe. ||March 13, 2018
ShannonH2535||40||Taking a trip down to Hyde Park wasn't a regretful decision and it was beautiful. Me and my boyfriend unfortunately ran out of activities to do for the day, so we decided this as an option. And it was a great couple of hours. We spent the majority of it walking around the pond and feeding the ducks, would be a great choice if you have children. There are also plenty of restaurants and cafès and plenty of restrooms scattered around the area. Although they have a 20p charge to them.||March 13, 2018
matte293||40||Always come here when I'm in London. It's lovely to sometimes get away from the bust city but still remain inside the city and enjoy and quiet place to wind down and relax. There is a tube located on the south east corner of it. There is a restaurant called The Lido to eat at as well if you haven't brought a picnic with you ||March 13, 2018
demain||50||in winter snow and in summer warmth it is the place to go, boating walking museums all there for ones pleasure||March 13, 2018
Amandasartori||40||It´s lovely to walk and enjoy the lake. But in winter there is not much more to do. Great place to find squirrels ||March 13, 2018
Mark G||40||Walked from one end to other last Sunday, with a stop off at the Lido café for a pot of tea.Great place just to watch the world go by, dog walkers, families, joggers, horse riders, swimmers (mad) and even people taking their suitcases for a walk too!||March 13, 2018
Amy_reviews_places||30||If you live in an area with lots of parks, skip it. If you live in a city, maybe it will appeal to you. Disappointed by the Princess Diana fountain. It’s a lazy circular river. ||March 12, 2018
Lisa S||50||I love Hyde park lovely massive safe park plenty of people about safe clean great to see wildlife loads to do for kids there is a park with swings slides and with plenty of seating. A swimming area to for adults I thought it was safe to walk round during the day and early evening not once did I feel afraid like I did with other parks. Lovely little waterfall nearby it is just gorgeous plenty of places to have a picnic or have something to eat and drink near by. I did see a couple of rough sleepers about sleeping on a bench and near oxford street as your coming into the park but they didn't cause any problems. Hyde park is the safest most prettiest park I've been to for a long long time its great for families walkers dog walkers runners joggers single people couples. Lovely lovely place I can't wait to go back there. I've been to Hyde park now twice and its a place where I want to come again. Its not that far from oxford street and other areas of London. ||March 12, 2018
gebbies2018||50||Space, greenery, trees, flowers, birds, people, children, lakes, bridges, fountains, dogs, horses, restaurants, cafes, ice creams, joggers, walkers, skaters & more.....a perfect place in the middle of London! Go and visit! See for yourself! ||March 12, 2018
CarolineC5199||40||I spent a wonderful afternoon exploring and walking in Hyde Park. It is quite large. There are many sites to be seen( Albert memorial, Princess Diana memorial fountain, Arch statue). I was lucky to have a sunny warm day. There were many people solo, families, dogs, runners, and opportunity to ride horses too. I had tea and cake at the Lido restaurant within the park. It was so relaxing.||March 12, 2018
KinkyNoodle||40||We walked through Hyde Park, from Paddington side to Knightsbridge. The park has many different sides to it, and would be wonderful to visit in the Spring/Summer. A cold wet March perhaps not ideal !||March 12, 2018
Rossonwye63||50||So much going on in the park, yet a peaceful place to jog which is the main reason I visit this park. The paths are wide and people respectful moving out of the way even if the walkways are full. A lot of the lawned areas were being replaced with new grass, so a fair amount of machinery but always careful of children and walkers. Lots of places to stop for light snacks and drinks, plenty of bird life especially the bright green parakeets who are vociferous and make sure they are heard.Thank you to London Parks who maintain this stretch of land so beautifully.||March 11, 2018
Sue F||50||Clean and tidy, plenty to see at every turn, the Italian Gardens, Kensington Place and the lake. Although we never used the park, it looked fabulous for children. ||March 11, 2018

nitzan||40||London gives you the understanding that people comes before concrete. When you are tiered of noisy streets, thats the place to relax. ||March 10, 2018
darius73||40||Went there on wet and cold December afternoon after lunch. Nice place for a stroll and just to while the time away on a park bench. You can feed the swans in the lake as well.||March 10, 2018
JoanneFromPerth||50||There are just some places test you HAVE to visit on a trip to London ... and this is one of them!The grass was all being dug up and replaced so there were barricades everywhere so we just stuck to the paths - which was a good idea as the ground was so sodden from recent snow!Lots to look at - the lake, the Diana fountain! We walked through from just near Harrods across to Marble Arch and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!||March 10, 2018
turkz120||50||Too big to write about accurately on here. Look to spend a full day here during the summer taking in the sun and going on a pedal boat ride. Grab some fish and chips and sit by the lake and eat. ||March 10, 2018
RoshanG187||40||It was a cold rainy evening when I was at Hyde Park. But its a lovely place to be, to have an evening stroll. You can see a variety of birds like ducks and swans in the ponds. The park looks so gorgeous||March 9, 2018

It also has the Diana Memorial Fountain and is home to many important and fascinating buildings. The park opens at 5am till midnight. The entry to the park is free.||March 9, 2018

ananda674||50||This park is open and safe for runners, cyclists, dog lovers, old and young. It is peaceful, clean and safe. We walked through this park, appreciating the peace in the middle of the city||March 8, 2018
netherd||50||It’s amazing full of nature and animals (squirrels in the best part) you can give them some nuts and they’ll come up on your legs to ear them! The lake is gorgeous and bars are really good even if they’re not so cheap ||March 7, 2018
Lars B||40||Hyde Park is very well located in the center of London. It is a very relaxing Place for a walk or to practice running or something like that. Very nice surroundnings and also close to Buckimham Palace. Do not miss the parade of soldiers mounting the guard and it is alos insteresteing to visit speakers corner on sunday arround twelve. ||March 7, 2018
Steeve P||50||What I really enjoyed when I was there was the canoe on the lake. It's awesome! Favor a sunny day and don't go alone - not necessarily "three men in a boat", two men, two women or a couple would work as well! And I remind you that daffodils will soon be blossoming all over the park. That's not something you would want to miss!||March 7, 2018
ehillround||40||You feel miles away once inside the park. It is great during the holidays when the Ice festival is in full swing. It is also beautiful during the spring bloom. Avoid it during really rainy weather as it gets a bit mucky and miserable. Good way to cut across from one side of town to the other. There are also bike stands where you can rent a bike and drop it off elsewhere.||March 7, 2018
OZS_ATW||50||I always walk from Paddington Station to Hyde Park. This park is so huge and offers so many things to do. A must to see attraction.||March 7, 2018
harund||50||When you visiting London and getting tired of shopping and historical places, you need to refuel and give a break. This park is huge and provide plenty of activities to enjoy; from Princes Diana Memorial, Italian gardens, Kensington Palace, lake and activities. There are always some activity all year around from concerts to Winter Wonderland or you could just walk and lay down on beautiful surroundings. A Must see!||March 6, 2018
Per G||50||You always discover something new when you walk in Hyde Park. The park is gigantic. You can see all kinds of people, Have a nice cup of cofee or a bit to eat in one of the many cafe's. Lovely in springtime with all the trees and flowers.||March 6, 2018
Anji1465||50||There is SO much to this park. Went originally to see Princess Diana memorial, but went to see the Italian gardens too. Very pretty n definitely worth a visit. Lovely place to have a picnic is by the enormous lake. Amazing to see wild parrots in the trees too!||March 6, 2018
tsephy||50||This park is on par with St. James' Park and you've got to see this place too as you can get an extreme up close with the squirrels and swans. You are allowed to feed them but we don't encourage rascals to chase after them. If you see any children misbehaving, I would highly suggest that you reprimand them and teach them how to treat the animals. You can enjoy an afternoon lunch or a picnic here when the weather is great, especially during the summer season. The same goes to St.James' Park.||March 5, 2018
patpatrick96||50||We took the red hop on/off bus & hopped off here. A great way to get away from the traffic, people & hub bub of this wonderful city. Take a stroll, pack a picnic, feed the birds. Probably the summer months are the best time to go. (Check your 'allergy ap.'1st!) In the winter time it snows but still has a different beautiful charm of its own.||March 5, 2018
MarkBrown57||50||We love Hyde park !! We leave around the area and is our recreation place...is good for the kids to place.Amazing...no words||March 5, 2018

956adriann||50||Last visited it in December when winter wonderland was here. This time we strolled through it to get to Kensington Garden to Kensington Palace. Lovely walk as always. Has speakers corner, 7/7 memorial and parrots in their dozens in the trees on the West side. Watch out for over friendly squirrels.||March 4, 2018
XFfile||30||I was here during the "Beast from the East" snow storm, so my memories of Hyde Park are cold, cold and snow. I do remember visiting many years ago and having a nice rest in the gras, but during the winter this is an open space where the wind has free reign and I would just want to cross it a fast as possible...||March 4, 2018
rohitkulthia||40||Bring your favorite read.. sit down and relax! also try to avoid the noisy western section for all the tour buses kinda drop folks there..||March 4, 2018
473wendyh||50||Hyde Park has something for everyone. Take your family or your special someone and stroll through the park. Don't rush your time here. You can enjoy people watching as well as swans, geese, and lots of dogs walking their people:) Take up a friendly game of football, or head to the Speaker's Corner to hear a lively exchange. We've enjoyed Hyde Park summer and winter. We try to enjoy a cup of tea (pastries, great pizza, wine, etc) from the cafe by the lake, but sometimes we head over to The Orangery in Kensington Gardens for something a bit fancier. We cannot wait to return.||March 4, 2018
donfl3344||50||Stayed a few blocks (about 5 minutes with a good tailwind) from the park and it was one of the places I didn't want to miss, so no little blizzard was going to keep me out. It was great, another thing off my bucket list. Must see.||March 4, 2018
magdalenaw371||50||Always take a walk in Hyde park when I’m in London. It’s a lovely place to spend a few hours and enjoy the green nature, the ponds and birds. There are several cafés along the way with possibility of sitting outside||March 4, 2018
l_ono138||40||Very nice large (! Dont underestimate the size) of the park. On a great walk from South Kensington to the Speakers Corner (Marble Arch) we saw geese, a hore riding trial, and a lot of grass. Nice to wander around if you want to escape the crowded Oxford steet for a moment, for example.||March 4, 2018
Shauna B||50||Saw only a small part of this beautiful park. I walked through a small section near Kensington palace. The gardens are expansive, well-used by locals and travellers as well as ducks and squirrels. So glad I stayed near this beautiful park and saw sections of it as I travelled by bus in to central London. ||March 4, 2018
HelenWSydney||50||Big beautiful park which is great for walks even in Winter.Large ponds house swans, ducks & many other birds.Kensington Palace is also in close proximity & another great reason to visit.Lots of space to run around, play sports, let your dogs play etc.Lots of squirrels around looking for their next meal & looking cute. A bonus if your visiting in December is Winter Wonderland which is huge & is set up as a winter theme park, with rides, a circus & lots of stalls in the Christmas markets. Along with lots of food stalls based on the European markets with German beer, food, mulled wine etc. It was absolutely a lot of fun, colourful & pretty during the evening hours that we spent there.On a whole Hyde Park is an oasis of green in a big beautiful city.||March 4, 2018
Jocelyn G||40||Our accomodation is quite close to the park and we were so fortunate to be here when there was snow & the park looked so beautiful and not many people about.||March 3, 2018
Ewa S||50||Wonderful place. I love that place in summer :) blanket, foodie drinks and husband definitely place to recommend ||March 3, 2018
Rosie W||50||I visit Hyde Park roughly twice a week and its one of my favourite places in London. There's a lot of variety and wildife and lots of places to grab a coffee or a sit down meal. Its beautiful in all seasons and a great escape from the hussle and bussle of London.||March 3, 2018
lovellgraham||40||Polite staff clean hotel good food nice room little small and bathroom toilet close to sink. But overall nice experiance||March 3, 2018
Emma G||50||Just a beautiful place to go for a walk, even in the rarity of thick snowfall in London. Walk along the Victorian pathways with ornate benches and street lights. You could maybe catch a glimpse of the wild parrots roosting or feed the swans on the serpentine. Visit memorials, see statues or just breathe in the atmosphere. There is much more to do at Hyde park, go see.||March 3, 2018
Shabri||50||Took a run through the park at dawn on a cold February morning - one of the most enjoyable ever despite the biting cold! A close look at the Albert Memorial and Diana Memorial Fountain is a must.||March 2, 2018
Yafit F||50||We went to Hyde Park for the winter wonderland and it was AMAZING! It went on and on and on... so many booths, games, food... tons of shows! We saw a circus, we went into an ice sculpture room, we just had so much fun. I'd recommend it to anyone - adults, kids, couples, families!||March 2, 2018
Sultana S||50||Me and my partner often go to hyde park its one of my favourite parks in london. The boat ride is good fun and we enjoyed it. There is plenty to see and its a nice walk with chairs around for people to rest. ||March 2, 2018
Ryan M||50||My favorite walking and running location in the heart of London. Several stands offering coffee and confections throughout as well. Whether you’re traversing through or having a picnic, beautiful park to have a break from the city. ||March 2, 2018
jbaker56||50||Its always good to have a good space for a stroll when you have time in London and what a better place than Hyde park pure delight.||March 2, 2018
Lois C||50||Beautiful park, had a great time! strolled around a bit looking at many spectacular views! wrap up warm though if you go in winter!||March 1, 2018
Laia P||50||It is considered to be the best park in central London and beautiful. There is a vivid wildlife and animals to take a look at. It is a must-go for tourists and also for locals - as every londoner must visit this park.||February 28, 2018
PaulFeist||50||I had just browsed and shopped my way through the food hall at Harrods and picked up a little picnic fare and set off towards Hyde Park.For years, since before my first trip to London in 2011, I have wanted to just take a walk in Hyde Park - I'm not even sure where the idea came from.On a bitterly cold February morning was not my best choice for a time to do this - but one can hardly blame the PARK for my poor planning skills, right?I walked along the Serpentine, spending some time on a bench to eat my pork pie, bit of yorkshire ham, and a scotch egg... I will even say that the birds were well mannered while they eyed me, waiting for me to drop anything they could grab (I didn't... but they were ready!).The park is beautiful, even on a cold February morning, and very well maintained - lovely for a walk, or as many people were doing, a run around the Serpentine.When I return to London (probably in a few years), I will do it again (only in a warmer month, and I won't buy sparkling water by accident, blech! ).||February 28, 2018
francescopaoloriccia||50||Full of happiness and life. The Hyde park is my favorite in London. It's the best place to relax yourself. I suggest to visit it during sunny days.||February 28, 2018
Rashelle M||50||Very large park with lots of space to admire London. There is a festival here for Christmas during the month of December that I absolutely loved! If you’re lucky enough to be in London for the holidays, I definitely recommend the festival. Outside of the holiday season, this park is great for picnics, walks, runs, etc. ||February 28, 2018
Dishaa S||50||it was once a sit for major protests in london but now it houses a fountain after princess diana which is really nice. the lush greenery is very pleasing to the eyes.||February 28, 2018
F9328EMthomasw||40||A massive park in London. It has a pond in the middle that you can hire peddle boats from. You can hire “boris” bikes using your credit card and go for a ride around the outside of it. There is a cafe and lots of nice bars and restaurants near enough. If visiting in winter it hosts Winter Wonderland which is amazing!!If your there on a Sunday head over to speakers corner and watch the debates ||February 27, 2018
Linda Y||40||Although the weather was bitterly cold I enjoyed the park, we had no particular part in mind but visited the Albert Memorial, saw the sunken garden at Kensington Palace and visited the round pond. ||February 27, 2018
Emmarhian||50||Lovely walk through the park and back lots to see and do. Will defiantly be returning. Loved the Peter pan statue||February 27, 2018
Jānis D||50||Hyde Park is always a great place to get lost from busy London life! It’s fascinating to hear the sound of city rush far away, but still it’s so quiet.||February 27, 2018
Sime M||50||Went to Hyde Park in the afternoon for a walk and i was surprised from the size off the park and the beautiful lake inside in the park, the Serpentine, and there were a couple of galleries there too. Lots of familes and i could see there were boats you could use on the lake. Theres also facilities if you need them and you could spend all day here in the summer i would think. Definitely worth a visit if you need to relax away from the crowds on Oxford Street, as i did!||February 27, 2018
meryphotos||50||Relaxing park. If you are bothered by animals, avoid staying long. There are sooo many squirrels and birds. I find it relaxing to be surrounded by nature in a city like London. Love it.||February 26, 2018

Titodamus M||50||feel like a break from all the walking and hopping about? or perhaps you're looking for public speakers corner?||February 26, 2018
EmilyHeatherMaher||50||Such a great place to visit, you can walk through and enjoy the gardens, monuments, Kensington palace and the serpentine, or rent a bike and cycle or skate through.||February 26, 2018
Ian R||40||With the frost glinting on the grass Hyde Park is a beautiful place to enjoy a brisk walk along one of the many footpaths that criss cross the Park. The Serpentine attracts a number of birds and there is nothing better when the sun shines in the cold winter air!||February 26, 2018
562piae||50||One of the most beautiful parks in Europe, for sure. Clean and nice, with a lot of animals and life. Loved it!||February 25, 2018

Judyhy||40||We walked from Marble Arch following signs for Lady Diana's Fountain. It was a good walk but enjoyable looking at the squirrels in the park and walking along the lake. We asked some people about the fountain but no one seemed to know where it was. We circled the entire lake but still no fountain so we cut through the park to Kensington.||February 25, 2018
sanou65||50||I like the restaurant in Hyde park We liked fish and chips place on front of the river! Nice place in summer! When the weather is warm and nice :)||February 25, 2018
westham16||50|| What a beautiful park it's such a peaceful relaxing walk on a sunny day, it's a gem of a place in a big city to relax.||February 25, 2018
krp329||50||We had a quick overnight stay in London and walked in the park both in the late afternoon, trying to stay awake and re-set our body clocks after an overnight long-haul flight, and again early the next morning. (Thank you, jet lag, for such an early jump on the day. :-) ) It's a lovely, green bit of nature. We admired the big trees, which were turning and there were heaps of leaves everywhere. All kinds of birds were in the ponds. There are statues and gardens. It's obviously much loved and enjoyed by residents - we enjoyed seeing a small slice of London life: joggers, dog walkers, parents and children ...||February 24, 2018
SandeepSandhu||50||Hyde Park is situated in the Central London and comprises of land spaces that were hunting grounds of the royalty in the eighteenth century. Very very green, open and welcoming for those who love to walk or jog. Some places of historical and cultural interest are also located in it. Could not visit the Hyde Park corner. ||February 24, 2018
kimcI2699NE||50||The last morning in London we took a casual walk through Hyde park and past Kensington Palace. It is a beautiful park four a nice casual walk. There is a pond with swans and ducks which was wonderful. Get a cup of trees or coffee and enjoy a morning walk. ||February 24, 2018

rotterdam0892||40||When you are near the V&A, it's a great way to get back to Paddington away from the traffic and a brilliant alternative to the underground. Fun to see all the birds and squirrels. Recommended.||February 22, 2018
fadelk374||50||We walked to the Diana Memorial which is definetely worth the walk, we stopped in the cafe for a quick tea and cake which was delicious. The views from the cafe are sensational and definetely a must!||February 22, 2018
sabai77Pijnacker||40||On a Sunday morning in London it is great to go to Hyde Park. My goal is at Marble Arch and listen to the various speakers on so called Speakers Corner. Mostly it concerns religious discussions but also politics is in favour. If you like to walk you can do several things you like. See the memorial for Princess Diana or just stroll around the lake. Good for exercise! ||February 22, 2018
Rolarola04||50||This is one of the best places to relax if you are tired from shopping and sightseeing. You can spend a good time here.||February 21, 2018
Bertybign||50||I walked through the park on my way to the Park Lane hotels from Lancaster Gate. It was lovely to see the flowers coming up and to watch the Swans and ducks on the lake.It is safe with visible patrols by Park Police and ultra clean. Watch out for the horses which are controlled by arrogant riders trying to exert some kind of dominance over pedestrians in a battle for right of way.||February 20, 2018
Stentrip||50||Whatever is the reason to walk through this park, it will worth the time.Once it was the hunting place for people of Buckingham Palace and nowadays is a resort for tourists, walkers, runners, ducks and swans.You can walk/run 10-15 km inside, crossing paths and been side by side with the lake, without getting bored and with just a little bit of luck, you will meet different kinds of birds and squirrels.Park is very well kept and if you give some time to trees they will show you, during the year, the beauty of the four seasons.A green lung at walking distance from Queen’s residence.If you like city parks, you will love it.||February 20, 2018
MarcoSeattle_WA||50||When the people and noise become too crazy for you, Hyde Park is the place to find refuge. It's the largest park inside urban London and even on the busiest day, you can find personal space.Bring a blanket and a picnic lunch to recharge your personal batteries. It's beautiful, peaceful and a treasure.||February 20, 2018
Jennifer G||50||Having arrived from Heathrow airport, and needing to wait 4 hours until hotel room was available, enjoyed a lovely nap in the shade on the grass, with families playing and workers enjoying their midday meals throughout the park. Wonderful place to stroll and enjoy a break from the hustle.||February 19, 2018
Roanoke21||50||Beautiful Park kept to excellent standards of cleanliness. Would like to come back in the summer to make better use of the grass :-)||February 19, 2018
Stella-Dot||40||If you are around the Marble Arch area, then try and find time to walk through this well kept park. Even on rainy days it is worth wrapping up and taking in the sights. As in all parks, there are short routes and longer routes, just gauge which is suitable to you. The trees, plants etc give good opportunities for sketching, if that is your hobby. Take your camera/equivalent.||February 19, 2018
Steppin-owt||50||A lovely park that intersects two major routes into London. A lovely place to wile away a few hours with something for everyone. Monuments, a lovely lake, historic buildings and open expanses of green park land. It's also a place for many organised and now expensive concerts. Once upon a time (60's/70's) these were free, different times!||February 19, 2018
Middlings||40||Great place to stop for a break. Also has heaps of squirrels which is cool if these aren't common where you live (as it is not common where we live). ||February 18, 2018

CatM593||50||The park is huge and cannot really be distinguished from kensington park. It is big enough to get away from the sound of the city.It has a big lake not far from the entrance with a small restaurant. The food is very nit spectacular, it is more for drinks and outside space to sit.You find a lot of people here but it dies not feel crowded, can take your kids, dog, partner and still find something to do. A lot of people run, cycle and walk around for photo opportunity.You can also do horse ridding and take a small boar on the lake.In spring they have a lot of flowers and in winter they host the winter wonderland fair.||February 17, 2018
neilhE2873MI||50||I walked through the park every day during my trip to London. Very pleasant, very busy, lots of wildlife to see and well lit in places.I didn't boat on the Serpentine but I did visit Diana's memorial fountain. The car park to this was being resurfaced during our visit and had very limited parking.||February 17, 2018
Josh_Michelle||50||Awesome place to visit to get a good dose of nature and greenery. Big enough to make sure you can get away from the crowds and have your own space.||February 17, 2018

shashankai||40||Sadly I visited Hyde park at the end of winter, just before the spring arrives. But even in the winter there was a serene beauty and the monuments were as glorious as they can be. Good place to atretch your legs and take a stroll. A must visit place in London||February 13, 2018
coolcatbailey||50||Had a great afternoon walking around and exploring this park. It is well kept and very busy even in the middle of winter!Saw the Diana's memorial, kensington palace and the round pond, plus much more. So there is stuff to do if your not the wandering type, however i loved just meandering around the park exploring and watching the ducks and other wildlife. It even has its own wild ringneck parakeets!!very peaceful, with only the occasion dog bark, there are cyclists and runners so be aware of those sneaking up on you.There are also some cafes available, so if your a people watcher ( in a non creepy way!) then this is a great place for you.Toilets are available for a small fee, or there are some free toilets for use in the serpentine art galleries.Another wonderful free treasure of london, i can imagine this would be a lovely place to bring children for a picnic in the summers months.||February 13, 2018
davidrG9990SX||40||Had a lovely walk through Hyde Park yesterday morning in the sunshine. The park is so well kept and offers lovely views. We had a walk through the Princess Diana Memorial which is very pleasant and fitting. The park is definitely worth a visit. ||February 13, 2018

Matt J||50||I was told about this magical park and I wasn’t disappointed.The wind started to sound nice, I started appreciating the environment, I was ore relaxed, food tasted so much better, music was so poetic||February 12, 2018

The_Loup_Garou||50||We usually stay right across Park Lane from Hyde Park, so are quite familiar with it. Besides walking through the Park (easy for us to get to Knightsbridge, without the pedestrian crowds), we often just stroll the Park. On this lovely Autumn day, we did just that, as we really had no place special to go. We crossed Park Lane from the Piccadilly side, and started in the little “island” surrounded by Park Lane, Grosvenor Place and Piccadilly, to spend some time there. We crossed back to Apsley house, and into the main section of Hyde Park, walking along the Serpentine to the Princess Diana Playground, which my wife had never seen.Our October trip was a bit earlier this year, and we found quite a bit of color in the trees. Though leaves had fallen, there was still quite a canopy on the trees. Often, we are a bit later, and most color is gone, as are many of the leaves. Quite a few of the plantings were still looking good, with lots of Autumn color there too.The only areas, where we had any issues was along Carriage Drive, at the Park’s edge, due to construction.A lovely stroll, and educational too, as we explored all of the monuments in that little section at Hyde Park Corner, which we had passed, and hurried through, but had never stopped. We then headed to The Berkeley for some Champagne, to cap off a lovely afternoon.As always, we will continue to return to Hyde Park, and cannot wait for our visit in late April, hoping to catch some Spring blooms.||February 12, 2018

The famous corner where the soapbox speakers expound on absolutely anything and everything is a spectacle. The roads around are naturally busy but allow easy access by bus to find an entrance into this oasis. ||February 12, 2018
durgasankar||40||I went there walking from my hotel - Hilton Metropole last July 2017. Had a quick walk by the Middle Easter Hookah joints, where people were seen enjoying a solitary and quiet or a chatty smoke. Reached the huge horse head statue, perhaps grazing on a green field. passed that and went through the gate, where maps of the park were put up. I could see people really enjoying their time with friends and family in the vast expanse of green. Promised myself - will come back once again to have a better look of the famed park||February 12, 2018
Michael M||50||great place to stroll around & spend relaxing time there. many places to eat or have a cup of tea, coffee or cool drink.||February 11, 2018

carlosdieppa||50||Hyde Park is right in the middle of things and we used a sunny day to ride around, probably best way to ride around Kensington is in bycicles.Stops in Marble Arch and the gardens.As you get out of the park be careful as streets quite narrow.||February 11, 2018

morganel437||50||Make sure to spend half a day in Hyde park specially during spring summer. I live 10 minutes away and go there for walls, runs and bike rides. Also gather picnics in the parks with friends during summer days. Stop by serpentine and Kensington palace. If you want to see the royal horses training go there around 7:30am in summer ||February 9, 2018
mdjohnst||50||At the end of Oxford Street, we decided to walk through Hyde Park instead of getting the tube. The park is huge and to be honest, there is not a lot there apart from open space. However open space is great meaning there is plenty of room for everyone.Whether you are running, cycling or just want to relax for a lunch hour it is the perfect place. There are some areas where you cannot see the surrounding city and think you are in the middle of the countryside. There is also a huge amount of wildlife to take in and some great photo oppourtunities.||February 9, 2018
MargaritaA||50||Huge park with loads to do. The kids love the Diana memorial playground and fountain. We also went to the Winter Wonderland festival and had a great time!||February 9, 2018

Dimitris L||50||Hyde Park is one of the nicest parks we have visited. There is much to see and do. Taking a walk is such a pleasure, but only in nice weather! We had the misfortune to visit on a very windy, cold and rainy day.... However we made up by re-visiting on a fairly sunny occasion as well, and really enjoyed it.||February 8, 2018
HannahT27||50||really nice open park, perfect for going for a lunchtime job or stroll! It is well kept, and nice a clean - would recommend coming here during the summer months as it is too cold in the winter.||February 7, 2018
queenlilibetii||40||An amazing park where everyone enjoys their walk, regardless of age, ethnicity etc. A park where you can enjoy nature every season! Squirrels, swans, ducks, trees and flowers...

DinkyIRL||50||located in the upper end of London, the big hotels are here, i.e. four seasons, Dorchester. the park is open and accessible , it has a bike rental nearby if you are feeling energetic , good way to get around park.

Cathcart_48||50||Didn't have much time to sight see while in London, but luckily my hotel was right on the doorstep of Hyde park. It was nicel to stroll through the park in the morning and enjoy the fresh air and see the swans and ducks on the lake. Lots of people out for a morning run or jog so it must be really busy in afternoons. Plenty of facilities available and i really liked the fountains.||February 5, 2018
Chris S||50||This park is lovely to see. Full of parakeets too! Iconic seeing speakers corner where the good and great have spoken. Well worth a visit||February 4, 2018
BrasilHol||50||Best park in London for any type of sport. Above Richmond as the traffic during weekends put cycles in danger||February 4, 2018
WavesInTheSun||50||Walking through Hyde park is such a treat: s close to the center yet big enough to feel out of it, it is the most beautiful big garden of the royals! In fact, Albert built a special place for his beloved (Queen Victoria): the Italian garden near Lancaster gate, its fountains and beautiful architecture is exquisite: my favourite stop after a hard day's work or on a sundat afternoon ( and if raining you can hide in the lovely coffee olace near by!)Families love the boating season and others feed the swans and birds who are pretty tame around the big pond...and Serpentine Gallery is a great place to visit if you like art, together with the several stunning scultures: a gem of a palce!||February 4, 2018
vikram g||50||I always enjoy this place, summer or winter, its always amazing and good experience. Must visit for anyone in or around London||February 4, 2018
PeterMoazzami||40||Hyde Park (close to hyde park underground) is a massive park in London (largest of four royal parks). You can enjoy a picnic, playing games, just taking a stroll, have a go at boating, horse riding, tennis, or jog or cycle around the park. Wintertime has the Winter Wonderland event which is great, and summertime has a lot of concerts and events which is fantastic. It's a beautiful park wintertime, but if you're in London during the summer, make sure you check out what's going on in Hyde Park and enjoy one of the many events that take place!||February 4, 2018

RANDI M||50||I could spend the day walking through this park. It is a lovely place to escape the big smoke.

arpitmittal2018||50||This is one of my favorite place in London. Despite of being in the centre of the town it's very quite and beautiful. It's a good place to rest after a good day of site seeing in London.||February 1, 2018
Sarah v||50||Hyde Park is a jewel in the middle of busy London. I always make it a point to stop by the Albert Memorial, as I find the sculptures representing 4 continents so beautiful and inspiring. The statues represent all the special things about the cultures on the different continents. The Serpentine is gorgeous, and I love to sit in the cafe and watch the boaters. One can horseback ride in the park as well as admiring the extraordinary flowers and plantings.||February 1, 2018
uwes297||30||It was very bad weather when we were going to Buckingham Palace through Hyde Park. Maybe this reason it was not so nice.I was in Central Park in New York and it was amazing. I can’t say this about Hyde Park...sorry for that.||February 1, 2018
Katerinka333||50||Every time I come to London I go to the Hyde park, to walk around, sit at the bench watching squirrels or sit at the Serpantine cafe to look over the lake. The tranquility of this place and the beautiful nature around really inspire. There is a beautiful rosarium as well, where you can take nice pictures and just enjoy the beauty. And you can reach many places walking through this park. Also in summer it is nice to go to the lake with a couple.||February 1, 2018

500dank||50||Visited London for one day and took my girlfriend for a nice walk through the park from Kensington gardens to Wellington Arch. I like the fact that the park is very wide open and spacious. A lot of things to do (Serpentine Art Gallery) and see (runners, people, sports). Only downside: toilets used to be free. Now, you have to pay just 20p. But the change machines are all out of service due to vandalism. Unfortunate. ||January 30, 2018

C6619LLrobw||40||Hyde Park makes a lovely setting for a weekend day out. The Serpentine shaped lake is a host to lots of different waterfowl. Also available are pedalos to hire. A few restaurants and toilets are dotted round the park.My favourite thing about the park is how tame the birds and squirrels are. Don't be surprised if you find a wild parakeet on your shoulder as you walk round.Keep walking round the lake, through the tunnel where Hyde Park changes into Kensington Gardens. Here you can walk down and see Kensington Palace.Great day out!||January 29, 2018
Emmanuel F||50||I loved walking around Hyde Park! It's massive and marvelous works of art can be found everywhere around you! Suitable for everyone, easily accessible and very close to a different kind of area in London! Definitely walk around it as a whole!||January 28, 2018

clairedjnj||50||Hyde park is amazing, there is always something going on somewhere, on our last visit we watched a karate class taking place then in another part some people had music on and were having a dance. There are squirrels everywhere bouncing around over the grass and up the trees. Lots of places to buy food and drink a gift shop by the lake where you can hire boats. In some areas you can hire deckchairs to lie back and relax on or you could just take your own blanket and have a picnic. It's a huge park, you could spend hours here||January 27, 2018

Lilian T||50||I participated in the organised swim in the lake in Hyde park at the end of the Summer. How lovely to be able to walk through this beautiful historic place.

Dogs run off lead through grassy areas not worn thin, wildlife (ducks, swans, Beatrice Potter squirrels and a wild party of parrots(?), birdsong greet you on your saunter through it.

andrea s||40||This is one of my favorite parks in London - there is so much to see and do... The weather was perfect and the park was really full with people and kids.

Gail A||50||The fact that it was a drizzly rainy morning when I did a quick walk through the park just added to its charm. The statuary is interesting, the paths are easy to navigate, and it's a nice change from the hustle and bustle on the streets and sidewalks. The hardest thing about it was figuring out how to get across the busy thoroughfares and into the park ||January 18, 2018

hhalvz95||50||Had the opportunity to go for a morning jog from my hotel through Hyde Park. This was so so much fun! I came across the Prince Albert monument which was such a neat hidden gem to find and ran all the way through the park to Buckingham Palace. In the early hours of the morning this place was amazing to see. So peaceful and serene without the bustle of bumbling tourists everywhere. ||January 15, 2018
Maria M||50||A real escape from the madness which is London. The trees were full of wild green paraqueets which have taken up residence in the park. We just ambled from one side to the other enjoying the peace. It was busy with families enjoying the cold but dry day but still a welcome break from the traffic.||January 15, 2018
Dillan1965||40||The park to visit when in London. It's huge. So much to enjoy whether you're strolling around, jogging or using various wheels under your feet. From the Serpentine Lake, to the various monuments, the gardens or the wildlife (including parakeets) there's something for everyone from morning to twighlight.It is also a good place from which to visit Marble Arch, Oxford Street, Apsley House and the Wellington Arch, Green Park and down to Buckingham Palace.||January 15, 2018

_sharonsieger||40||Very big temporary luna park, lots of activities for all ages. Lots of food, spacial arts and crafts and tourists staff.||January 13, 2018
Tomasmalling||40||Really nice park, with lots of paths and pedestrian roads across the huge green spot. No bikes or other fast moving harrasments can spoil a relaxing trip. ||January 12, 2018
jay_the_traveler_00||40||Well this place is an absolute beauty right in Central London!You can spend hours and not even notice the time passing due to the environment, it's just great to relax and leisurely explore nature and eye ball all the greenery. If you travel during winter periods, ensure to be wrapped warm.There is a nearby cafe and washroom facilities as well as public transport right outside the entrance literally!I often enjoy sitting by the lovely pond surrounded by all the ducks and swans and just watch the world turn by.There are bicycle for hire as well as hiring paddle boats. If you fancy keen exploring without being too tired of walking a lot. Although walking is enjoyable here!||January 12, 2018
Brian J||50||Hyde Park is quite amazing, our accommodation was right across the road from it. There are so many things you can do in the park which we walk in around most days also rode a bike through the park. Lady Dianna fountain was the main highlight for us. ||January 12, 2018
Simone T||40||I've been here with my girlfriend in Autumn, and the place become really suggestive. Go for a walk..||January 11, 2018
139rashmis||50||you can easily spend a half day or more leisurely exploring and taking in the greenery. You can rent a bike and spend the day pedaling all over Hyde Park, making stops wherever you choose. This place is surely on my list of free things to do in London . ||January 11, 2018
McAnnie1||50||What's not to like. We were staying on a Park Lane hotel so every morning walked through Hyde Park. Love the pond & surroundings as well as the horses trotting through the park. It's hard to believe it's in central London.||January 11, 2018
Hugary1||50||Fantastic open spac to walk about. In December it is a bit chilly so dress very warmly. There are bikes for hire. In winter there seems to be only one main toilet in use so be aware of your needs by locating it near the lake. In summer I imagine it will be packed and very busy. Easy walking area.||January 11, 2018
jonyv102||50||Beautiful and clean park.It's a big park for a great walk.Enough places to chill and watching passengers or just enjoying the water.||January 11, 2018
Vanessa7197||50||I come here often. You can walk a lot. Or cycling. Or just sitting near the pond and enjoyng sun. Just come once and you will come again and again.come ||January 9, 2018
Leonardo S||40||The Winter Wonderland was a great opportunity to get the most of Hyde Park during December winter. My 2 years old daughter had real great time in the fun fair over there. The Nutella Crepes and German Hot Dogs were fantastic as well.||January 9, 2018
cindyandted||50||Great walk. Loads of water fowl. Tranquil place in heart of london. Various places to stop for coffee and food. ||January 9, 2018
Светлана А||30||I came here with great anticipation, but in fact there is nothing special in Hyde Park. The lake is big, but not exactly spectacular. As for the Italian garden, it was rather shabby, with lots of fallen leaves and dirty. ||January 8, 2018
R7783GYmarieg||50||Best place for calm and quite. in the heart of London. Time to relax and enjoy. Greatest park ever. everuthing you see is amazing ||January 8, 2018
teoweme||50||Great place for a jog, each season brings a different feel. Winter wonderland is very fun. Hyde park connects many places like marble arch (end of oxford street) to knightsbridge (harrods and all). Used to jog through the park and have brunch at whole foods. Always worth a visit. ||January 8, 2018
D1765YXmichaelt||50||Hyde Park is lovely all year round but insert Christmas through Winter Wonderland and the experience becomes absolutely Awesome . Well organised with so much to see that you can spend 10am to 10pm and still want to stay longer. Highly recommend the famous Ice Sculptures. What an experience well worth enjoying. ||January 7, 2018
Steven H||50||Favourite place in london. Its got it all . Every sunny day im free it's the best place too go !free and beautiful must go ||January 7, 2018
kgooge||50||The winter festival was amazing! There were lots of activities for adults and children alike. It is an easy walk from the tube station at paddington.||January 7, 2018
RobinTinto||50||Loved the peace and tranquility of taking a walk around Hyde Park Serpentine today.Such a great place 8 miles round - and something that most tourists probably miss when they come to the city.Try it !Robin Tinto||January 7, 2018
Ryan G||50||Great place to just come here, kick back, and chill, if you know you know. Loads of people here just come to chill.||January 6, 2018
SquirrelJiu||50||I love Hyde Park so much, esp I can't find something like this in HK! I visited this place many times, most recent are last May and Nov 2014.Good:- beautiful !!- perfect for picnic, prepare your food and blanket pls-perfect for running- a lot of birds, swans- with a restaurant near the serpentine lake- very easy to get toBad( very difficult to think about):- maybe one more restaurant ?- kind of difficult to find good weather to visit?||January 6, 2018
Sally L||50||Hyde Park is lovely - big, lots of different things to see, two 'sit down' restaurants and several coffee stalls. Lots of things to watch.||January 5, 2018
Eric_Greeney||40||A great place to have a picnic on a sunny day. Wide lawns are beautifully green and many people spend their time there relaxing in this peaceful place in the middle of city buzz. The much famed Speakers corner was not too clearly visible at the area of Marble Arch, but we enjoyed our time in Hyde park nonetheless.||January 4, 2018
whitneys239||40||Nice place to walk around and relax. The Swans are beautiful. Hard to find a restroom. I would like to see it in the summer.||January 4, 2018
bobbysobo||50||Walked through here on the way to Winter Wonderland. This is a very well kept park that is dog friendly. The walkways are paved, so walking and biking are easy and safe. If you are in town, take a look!||January 4, 2018
nicolalk96||50||Enjoyed a beautiful morning walk through this park on my stay. It becomes part of Kensington Gardens which are equally as beautiful. There are cafes dotted about the park which provided toilets and refreshments.||January 4, 2018
Maj S||50||It is always a pleasure to walk around Hyde park. It is huge so you never seen it all and depending on the season the feeling is also different. I love how it is peaceful and relaxed just in central busy London.A must see in London||January 4, 2018
Huda A||50||Nice park for walk and nice electrical games during Christmas. its also good to go in the morning for walk and feeding ducks and the birds.||January 3, 2018
sharonmarsden1256||50||Hyde Park is fantastic to walk around and admire the magnificent gardens. We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon of strolling around, watching all the animals and birds. We had a bite to eat by the lake and the food was pretty reasonable. We walked back to Trafalgar Square via Buckingham Palace. It didn't take that long at all.||January 3, 2018
Patricia R||50||The winter wonderland is as great as the park. It’s huge so take a day to do it: the Peter Pan statue, the Lady Di memorial and if you go in the last days of December the winter wonderland is a fair so great (also works at night and has entertainment for the whole family) that you won’t regret being there even if you freeze. ||January 3, 2018
Mallaury D||40||The Hyde Park is beautiful especially during Christmas with the funfair. You can go with your friends or your familly ||January 3, 2018
edraupp||50||During the winter holiday season, the part of the park near Speakers' Corner becomes a fairground, with amusement rides, food, gift stands, and entertainment. On Sunday, Speakers' Corner is a hoot. Listen both to the speakers and the hecklers. Or just stroll through the lovely green space in the heart of London.||January 3, 2018
lour2013||50||My daughters and I were lucky enough to stay in the Hyde Park area the first week of December. The park is large and quite beautiful. Lots of green space for many outdoor activities. During the Xmas holiday they set up Winter Wonderland with a Xmas market, carnival type rides, a Bavarian Village and lots lots more. We went in the evening and everything was just so pretty and lots of fun. It has its own website. Unfortunately it is not there now but if you have a chance to go next year it’s worth the trip. However, this park is worth a visit at anytime. ||January 3, 2018
M1815FFangelar||50||Early morning was the best!!! My husband and I went early on our way out of london and it was basically empty (except for runners! I had a broken foot so I could not run but it was perfect for a run!) we got fabulous photos without having to wait for other people!||January 3, 2018
Asteria1981||50||While walking around London we entered this Huge Park. It is really nice, full of people but you can also find quiet place where you can enjoy nature. Bar right next to lake is really nice also for drink your coffe.||January 3, 2018
AnaSPereira||40||To walk around Hyde Park with nice weather is one of the best experiences I had in London. It's a peaceful place to just walk around, to see the lakes and the birds, to see the squirrels... And still, in a couple of minutes you can be walking about in the streets of London again. It's great. ||January 3, 2018
sanctiss||40||A great time of the year to visit and catch the Winter Wonderland. Lot’s of shopping, food, drinks, music and theme park rides all around. You could easily spend a whole evening exploring this place.||January 2, 2018
Bobsiesmum||50||A wonderful experience..so much to see and do. We loved the Ice Experience.We visited in 2016 and enjoyed it so much we came back again in 2017. Very magical.||January 2, 2018
RosieStewart9||50||Visited Winter Wonderland for the second time, and this year it was just as magical! It’s free entry and the stalls are lovely. The rides are reasonably priced and it’s a good vibe! Went on the big wheel and the views are amazing, definitely worth a go!||January 2, 2018
TeeJay272015||40||Visited the winter wonderland on 21 Dec, it was very well organized with adequate stalls for games, drinks and food. The big crowds were very well handled. The ice skating rink was a special attention to all our kids. Had a very enjoyable time as the weather was kind and did not rain. ( rain will definitely spoil the fun as there's no place to stand under?) ||January 2, 2018
KatieB5030||50||A nice sunny afternoon, nothing better to get away from the hubbub of traffic with a stroll through this beaautiful park and rent a row boat and row on the serpentine.||January 1, 2018
4KidsLuvTravel||50||We stayed in a flat a few blocks from Hyde Park. We enjoyed walking through the park on the way to reach other destinations. We didn't have time to go to Winter Wonderland. One night, the West end of the park was blocked off, and we could not walk our intended route.Nice to see the people walking dogs, and running. Reminds me of Central Park in NYC.||December 31, 2017
Justin S||40||I would say this is on par with visiting Central Park. The park is massive. Has beautiful plant and animal life (birds), 2 art galleries, many statues, a large river crossing through, huge man made duck ponds and Kensington Palace sitting at one end. Added bonus, winter wonderland was going on when we visited, which had many activities and attractions for the kids (and beer and food for the parents). The park itself is so large, the family and I visited twice to make sure that we saw everything. Only down side, as with all of London, few public bathrooms to find anywhere.||December 31, 2017
MargaretW2223||50||This has to be one of the very best winter wonderland we have ever visited. Boxing day. Very busy with a great atmosphere. The Bavarian village (massive marque) with food stalls, music, lots of seating was great. Outside more stalls with food drinks and goods. A fun fair for all ages too. What a brilliant place to go to.||December 31, 2017
wcfox09||50||My husband and I walked through the Winter Wonderland on our first night in London and had a fabulous time. There were a variety of foods, drinks, and fun things to do. We especially enjoyed the Christmas Market. If you are in London for the holidays this is a great spot for couples and families!||December 31, 2017
gcaste01||50||Lovely park, but also went to the Winter Carnival over the Christmas holiday. Lots of great food (oh the hot chocolate with a flake bar on top!) and beer/wine, rides, and the usual carnival games (hoop too small for a basketball to go through, bottles too heavy for the ball to knock them over, etc), and good stalls of crafty things to bring home as souvenirs.||December 31, 2017
patricia w||40||Truly a magical place. Winter Wonderland is staged in Hyde Park in November and December.Lots of attractions for adults and children. Many eating stations - mainly massive hot dogs and burgers together with German sausages, and trimmings, all areas beautifully clean,although as expected - prices a little on the expensive sideAlthough a sight I wouldnt have missed!||December 31, 2017
AlexandruD832||40||We walk through the park in mid October, on a Sunday before sunset as we looked for the speakers corner.The park is quite large and includes several attractions like the speakers corner, the lake with beautiful swans, the marble arch.As points to improve I noticed that there are not so many benches to rest. Also more gardens would improve the aspect of the park and would bring joy to visitors.I recommend to visit the park and to spend at least 1-2 hours walking through the park. You can easily reach the park by underground network (Marble Arch, Knightsbridge, Hyde Park Corner, Lancaster Gate, Queensway Stations).||December 31, 2017
greekcypriot2009||50||The Hyde Park and Kensington Parks are virtually contiguous areas in Central London and is only separated by the Serpentine River and Bridge of which roughly the Upper Half is the Hyde Park. Both these parks are the so called lungs of London, comparable to central park in Manhattan in New York City. Hyde Park has a total area of 142 hectares (as compared to 111 hectares of Kensington park and 16 hectares of the serpentine) and this park was initially used by King Henry VIII for hunting and then became the site of the Great Exhibition of 1851 (London Expo) and besides being a popular attraction it is also a major site for demonstrations of whatever kind. On Sundays there is chaos at Speakers Corner where anyone can get up on their soap box and rant about anything and everything under the sun to the delight of the people who go to heckle them! It is kind of mad! It was only meant to be allowed on a Sunday and you have to stand on something that is about 10' off the ground so that you are not standing on British soil. There is Speakers Corner, the Serpentine, Albert memorial, memorial to Princess Diana and loads of places to walk, sit and relax or cycle and rollerblade. The rest of the Park is lovely with a mix of wide open spaces, woodland, memorials, ponds and gardens. At the Far End of Hyde Park near the Wellington Arch and Aspley House is the Achilles Drive and a large Achilles Statue that commemorates the First Duke of Wellington. (Arthur Wellesley) who had several victories in the Napeolonic Wars against Napoleon Bonaparte.||December 30, 2017
Alampe23||50||I love Hyde Park in every season. It's a must visit for locals and tourists alike. In the warmer days, make sure to head to the serpentine for a drink and maybe a pedalo ride. Take a walk around the different areas of the park as some are very undisturbed and peaceful - you forget you're in central London for a minute.At Christmas, there is Winter Wonderland which has free entry and plenty of rides, food, German beer and food. ||December 30, 2017
Dafne D||50||what a nice park ... whish in spain could have the same. love england and love |London ...best place to live.||December 30, 2017
lvseouladventure||50||This park is beautiful and full of actions. We were only able to enjoy the park for a short time and wished that we can come back to fully enjoy what this park offers. I guess we’ll have to wait for next time!||December 30, 2017
scorpionana||50||This was my first visit to this venue. We arrived about 2pm and the atmosphere was buzzing the Xmas stalls looked lovely colourful and packed with gifts. The Bavarian village was a hit all round with hot delicious food and beers. Well worth the visit for all ages youngest to the oldest. Book early for the ice ring and other fee paying shows just to avoid queues .||December 30, 2017
JimW551||50||We love Hyde Park and it was a treat to walk through it in the winter! Very crowded as there wasn’t any rain! Lots of dogs playing, people walking or biking! What a relaxing place!||December 30, 2017
Aaronfitz1||50||Hyde park ticks the boxes as the best way to spend an afternoon in London. I do enjoy walking here whenever I’m in London, love the scenery, it is at its best on a scorching summers day.||December 30, 2017
Alex C||50||such a beautihul park! very nice on hot and sunny daysand close to hyde park corner tube station! definitely go and grab an icecream and watch the ducks||December 30, 2017
wendyg62||50||First time at the winter wonderland have to say it was lovely, we went on a Thursday early afternoon only had to queue for a very short while to get in , went straight to the ticket office to buy tickets for the bar ice , got them straight away and walked into the ice bar with no queue. Walked around all attractions and little shops stopping for hot Chocolate along the way. We didn’t find it expensive at all , it’s London it’s a Christmas event and specialist stalls . I guess it’s as expensive or cheap as you want to make it, will definitely go back again. ||December 29, 2017
MaroM68||50||A huge Bavarian village in the middle of Hyde Park!!!Don’t miss a hot bratwurst and enjoy a beer under the big tend. Playground includes a roll coaster and ice skating.Plenty of small gifts to choose If you are in London this time take 2 hours to walk around this place||December 28, 2017
shannonp232||50||We planned our trip to London prior to hearing the July concert announcement for the British Summer Series. Kismet? Fate? Destiny? Perhaps, but any way you slice it we flipped after hearing that four of our favorite artists would be playing on the same day while we were on vacation.We snapped up VIP tickets before you could say Tom Petty, and enjoyed The Head and The Heart, The Lumineers, Stevie Nicks and the late great rocker. These folks know how to host a music festival. Top notch everything. Clean, safe, fun, terrific food, no lines and spotless facilities. We will be back.||December 28, 2017
Kaz055||40||Such a hidden gem in the middle of London, with something for everyone... Along by the Rose gardens you will find the green parrots a plenty, Children loved the whole experience ||December 28, 2017

gaylew559||50||As in all Parks in England it is enjoyable just to be amongest the English people enjoying their day. They seem to embrace public parks in a totally connected way - they don't seem rushed - they're relaxed like its an extension of their living quarters. I find in North America they give off the feeling of being rushed - like they're visiting and they have to leave soon. Speakers Corner was not as enjoyable as I thought it would be but it was still really interesting....what I didn't enjoy was the hecklers in the crowd when people were trying to speak. Print a park map before going....its really huge ....I missed out on the Rose Garden because I simply could not walk anymore....the paddle boats were relaxing and row boats were romantic. I didn't think the Lady Diana Fountain was the best dedication to her.....it was too simple & not impressive in any way.....only true improvement the park needs is More Washrooms.....so few and hard to find.....I will for sure be back to Hyde Park and also St James Park in front of Buckingham Palace had the same lovely relaxed feeling.||December 26, 2017
GA_GC_90||40||I visited on December 2, 2017. The trees were already bare, but the gold falling leaves were still on the ground. I spent 2-3 hours here. A large & beautiful place to stroll around.||December 26, 2017
bumble247||20||The park seemed dirty and there was mud along the path leading into the winter wonderland. I was visiting the winter wonderland with my young son. A waste of money to be honest. ||December 26, 2017
PanosVS||50||When you are travelling in London with kids this park can be an excellent attraction for little kids...park wildlife is a challenge for little visitors and you may stay all day there if weather is good.||December 26, 2017
BruceR_2832||40||This is an expansive, multi-use park. There is a lot of open space for sports, seeing the sights, or just relaxing. It is a nice tranquil place to walk around, get some sun, people watch, and enjoy some fresh air.||December 26, 2017
546james||40||There are many interesting sections in the park. One can have coffee close to the Serpentine, there are interesting gardens. the park is ideal for walking.||December 26, 2017
Jose D||50||Nice and green place located in the heart of London. Walking there is a pleasure. You can find some Kensigton Palace and spend some time in this huge garden.||December 26, 2017
RATMANDUDE||40||Amazing winter wonderland! Really great market. It feels like a German christmas market in its scope but with different booths. Long queues were frustrating... but we went during a busy Friday.||December 25, 2017
ianh10||30||Every visitor either has children or they don't. We have two so they loved it. All kids lke rides food games , circus, ice sculptures etc. So no issues with children, as an adult I expect to que here and there ofcoarse. There nothing I can find that I'd want to say to people to stop them going, only don't go at night, the ques because of the Security checks looked ridiculas as we were leaving, why no one else hasn't said this I'm staggered. It's far too expensive my opinion, but you have your own opinions on whatIs expensive. Some of the rides like the Dodgems, there are way too many cars soYou can't get anywhere when on them, 8 too many on one that's a lot, this is pure greed which disappoints me. Circus excellent , ice house excellent, big wheel excellent.My opinion with food is keep it simple, they do but there's value in anything £6 for a plain nothing on it hot dog. I had a a chip butty, she looked at me when I asked for it like I had two heads, this is England we live on it , where are all the pies pasties etc .A good day overall nothing's perfect but they talk about child exploitation, and never Do it, but we do don't we.||December 25, 2017
DCSmith||50||Hyde Park is a terrific visit much like central park in NYC. IT is much larger than meets the eye; so be prepared for a long walk if you want to walk the length of it. ||December 25, 2017

TheShis||40||While Hyde park is an OK park on regular days, it is absolutely STUNNING during the Winter Wonderland festival.The place was absolutely packed during our weekend visit.We enjoyed the strolls, a quick bite to eat at the Serpentine cafeteria and the two Serpentine galleries, plus - obviously - the wonderful Winter Wonderland park.Highly recommended. Just make sure not to visit during the weekend, as the place is too packed for comfort.||December 23, 2017
juansome||50||Such a cute park! The swans swimming in the river almost make it a romantic spot. Princess Diana Memorial Fountain is here as well. ||December 23, 2017
RobYoungAust||40||It was wonderful to stroll through the park and enjoy the fresh air, autumn leaves, the swans and ducks on the Serpentine. Large wide paths, good signage, and easy access from the city make this a great place to visit away from the bustle. ||December 23, 2017
Andonella T||50||Lovely Christmas atmosphere. Huge fairground and Xmas market stalls. Something for everyone. We got into the park no problem from the Marble Arch end but people were queuing to get in & have bag searches on Park Lane entrance. Seemed a bit academic to me if you can get in with no hassle from a different entrance. Worth going to get you in the Christmas mood though.||December 22, 2017
482martinr||40||I love walking through Hyde ParkIts a great cut through to get to Westminster areaCan get crowded in the summer, if you want to spend time there get there a little early and grab a bench areaWatch out for the squirrels, they can be a little cheeky and have no mannersWildlife is great, park is kept clean||December 22, 2017
Naughtee||40||The day started gloomy with rain but by lunch time the sun came out and changed the whole atmosphere. The rides were awesome, some not for the faint hearted. The lights, food, games and rides made it a wonderful fair for the family. We ended up spending the whole day here, instead of the 3 hours we originally planned, haha. Good family attraction.||December 22, 2017
Sam M||50||The Kensington gardens or the private Italian gardens wow wow and more wowThis beat Central Park any day so many options and walking through the park to get to places in London is fantastic ||December 22, 2017

Searchin4Vacays||50||Hyde Park was on my bucket list and I must say, it was by far the highlight of my trip. The Royal Swans make this park a jewel not to be missed. Along a path a cam across a flock of parrots and that is quite unexpected in London in December. All the birds were gentile and looking for a snack!||December 22, 2017
pinkypoo2007||50||HYDE PARK is to the British what Central Park is to the Americans...  THERE IS ONLY ONE AND ONLY :-)Hyde Park sits right in the middle of London and is an oasis, where you can everything - simply walk, relax, jog, meet people, ride your horse ... simply everything ... when you wish to escape the hassle and buzz of the city you have here the opportunity to relax and re-charge your batteries... In all seasons it is worth enjoying it... ||December 22, 2017
UKL808||40||I was surprisingly very impressed with this. For a Saturday in December we were quite apprehensive when seeing the crowds, it was extremely busy, but the Winter Wonderland handled it well and queuing was pretty minimal. Loads to see, do, buy, eat and drink, we had a really nice few hours here and would return.||December 22, 2017
vasnakos||50||Feel the London parklife at it's best! A whole new world at the center of the city! Take your time and spend a few hours at Hyde Park!||December 22, 2017
71globaltraveller||40||Visited Hyde Park for the Winter Wonderland. The Cinderella on Ice ice skating is fantastic and very well done. Book online for tickets. Los of nice craft shops, food, mulled wine and waffle outlets available. The Bavarian village has nice live music, beer and Bavarian food.The children's carousels etc section was not very exciting for adults. A nice 2-3 hrs to relax. Plan on walking for approx 10-15 min from the tube stop to enter.||December 21, 2017
seeker21||40||We visited this attraction on a cold winters night. There are queues to get in and the place was very busy. Make sure you book in advance if you decide to ice skate etc. It was set up like an old time fairground. Rides, stalls , little restaurants (that were full) , hotdogs, bars, and the best thing of all hot chocolate. While worth a visit I would not recommend for small children. Just to busy and despite being a fair ground not a lot to attract them. Santa was there though but another line to see him. My teenager had fun on the wild rides. ||December 21, 2017
roryf71||50||Great part of London all year round. A green pasture in the middle of a crazy cosmopolitan busy city! Winter Wonderland in winter is a lovely Bavarian experience whilst picnics and walks in the spring are amazing. Simply British ||December 21, 2017

fentontim||50||Visited Hyde Park to experience Winter Wonderland. Lots of nice craft cabins (not tacky at all) bars and food outlets readily available - warmed ourselves up with several mulled wines! Live music on the main stage, in the Bovarian Village and on the moving bar carousel - good fun and lots to see and free entry||December 19, 2017

Sofi N||40||Near the speakers corner at Hyde park (tube station Marble Arch) there is a Christmas market set up. It is a nice walk. Your bags are being checked at the entrance. You can by some hot dogs and drinks and many articles, like teddy bears, scarfs, gloves, hats etc. Very convenient for small gifts, provided the weather holds. Amble space to walk around.||December 17, 2017
Yolyni||50||A great feeling, a unique experience walking in this beautiful park in the heart of London. We love walking from Harrods to Marble Arch/ Oxford through the park. And during Christmas period, winter wonderland is a great amusement park.||December 17, 2017

bobwarren||50||We took a late afternoon stroll through the park. It was so nice to be in an environment where people interacted..stopped and chatted and upon learning you were a tourist welcomed you.Dogs ran..birds called..squirrels scurried with their horde of nuts for the winter.A beautiful place. ||December 17, 2017
720andreym||50||I love parks, and Hyde park is not an exclusion. It’s very important to keep natural spaces in big cities…||December 16, 2017
EugeneT751||40||A lovely place to stroll around in. You can have a coffee by the Serpentine or take a boat out on it. The biggest attraction in my opinion are the grey squirrels that are so tame that they will climb up onto you and let you feed them. So bring nuts!!!||December 16, 2017
mangsimone||50||This is the place one should visit it is wonderful so beautiful and tranquil all time of the year we recommend.||December 16, 2017
Leon M||50||Worth a wander, this park is massive but well kept with a lot of widelife and picturesque scenes. A must see.||December 15, 2017
Misslouboutin19||50||So it’s been on my bucket list to go to Hyde Park winter wonderland for a few years. So was down in London and thought I must go this year and I wasn’t disappointed. I must say I had been shopping all day and had that many bags that it made my experience uncomfortable so I suggest going when u have your hands free from any bags. Also wrap up as I went the last week in November and it was freezing. Expect a que to get in although it’s free to get in everyone gets there bags searched which is fine by me. I couldn’t get over how big it was and how many things there was to see. Plenty of rides lots to eat lots to drink. The only thing I was disappointed with was the stalls they seemed to be all over the place and were quite repetitive. You can also Ice skate, go to the circus, see a ice show, go to the ice kingdom. There’s so many things to do and see u can spend hours here. It is very pricey for the rides and food and the stalls but all Xmas markets are. There’s also huts u can go in that have heaters and u can order pizza and do karoke. I was not disappointed but if u had a few kids I could imagine it costing a fortune. ||December 15, 2017
sarahmQ9394JQ||50||Amazing!!!!!!!! Had the best day for my birthday can't wait to come back ! Definitely worth the visit ||December 15, 2017
ChasMe||50||Loved it last time, even better now. No visit to London at this time of year would be complete without spending a good few hours here. Heaps of food and drink. Plenty to see and do. Rug up as it was freezing the evening we visited but there is plenty of mulled wine to warm you up. Everything seems to be on sale for £5. You would have missed a great experience if you don’t go!||December 14, 2017
n0mad_nellie||50||Hyde Park is a stunning place for a walk, run, sit... There are so many paths and monuments. Keep an eye out for grey squirrels - being Aussie they were a novelty to mt kids||December 14, 2017
madwife12017||10||We went to Winter Wonderland full of excitement and Christmas cheer. We left feeling ripped off and disappointed. It was snowing on the day we visited and we thought this would add to the experience....... Wrong! The flooring that is used, a mixture of decking and plastic, was so slippy it was like walking on the ice rink. There was a group of 16 of us in total and it was only due to us all helping each other we all avoided a trip to A & E. This was forecast weather and should have been planned for.On arrival our bags were search (I'm happy for this) however the same woman checked all our bags which then left us puzzling??? Three of our group was carrying water bottles but only one of the ladies was made to empty her bottle of water on the ground in front of her, the other two got to keep theirs??? Bags searched but not checked otherwise! Two of our part had bumbags on under their coats and this was not picked up at all. Security is poor at this event and anyone could get anything in under their clothes here!Once in EVERYTHING is over priced and commercial. Why is it that they don't understand the concept of pricing? If you are reasonable priced you will sell more! They best was to describe Winter Wonderland is as a glorified fair ground which has a few fairy lights. You need a second mortgage to let the kids on the rides. Father Christmas was a lovely man (hence the 1 star) but take your own child's present. Our 19 month, 2 2/12 & 6 year olds we're delighted to see him but was all given one of those stretchy toys. These toys were tiny maybe cost 5p? Also had to be confiscated immediately due to choking hazard. We ended up pretending Father Christmas had given us some money to treat them to a ride each. I would have happily paid to see him for a descent, age appropriate gift. Food........ Over priced but clean. Christmas markets all commercial, over priced and not independent stall holders. We saw the same stall over and over. FYI don't rely on the map to get you around as it means nothing. I drove to the other side of France with no SatNav but couldn't negotiate this place!||December 14, 2017
Rix_11||50||The day we went walking and went to the park, it was snowing. The local people all kept telling us about how unusual it was as it “doesn’t Snow in December” the park looked lovely with its light covering of snow, mind your step though as the pavements become very slippery. The Wintr Wonderland was available, as we don’t have children we didn’t bother to go in, the lines were still long to buy tickets, the pre-purchased ticket line was small, that looks like the best option. five rating due to the glorious snow and excellent photos we managed to take.||December 14, 2017
RandRCalifornia||30||Visiting London in December is not exactly stroll through Hyde Park season but we wanted to see it. There is a Christmas carnival going on with rides and shops. You pay to enter - we did not do this - instead we walked down to the water. We were pleasantly surprised by the huge amount of ducks swans and geese! That alone made our time there worthwhile. It's an evening out in the month of December if you go for the Christmas activities as well.||December 14, 2017
melissag326||50||Huge park. Several tube stations at the varying corners. Skipped the Diana fountain and saw the Peter Pan statue and Italian fountains. Serpentine gallery is in the middle of the gallery, it was cold outside so we went in there to warm up. The desired art was not to my liking. The heat was though. Park was not crowded, but it is so spacious and plenty of space for reflection. The lake near Kensington palace had swans... in December. Beautiful. Well kept park. ||December 14, 2017
pretty_mtc||40||It is the time of the season where part of Hyde Park will be converted to a super fun playground... the Winter Wonderland!Try out all the rides available!||December 14, 2017
Baciccia_Riou||30||A good site for the pic nic. You can spend sa relax time in the center of London. A nice place easy to get. ||December 13, 2017
Luke A||40||Still a little crowded but with green open spaces and cute animals to feed! You could also swim in the serpentine if you wished||December 13, 2017
Sophie H||40||Such a huge park. Lovely views all round and lots of little ponds and wildlife. A bit scary to walk through at night as its not well lit all round. Quite peaceful in most areas and close to other popular places in London such as Oxford Street. Also close to an amazing restaurant; Hard Rock Cafe.||December 13, 2017
Sprost1||40||Considering where this park is, it's remarkably quiet. It's nice to just walk around on the spacious paths and watch the wildlife in the Serpentine. There were a couple of cafes where we walked so you can stop off. The Diana Memorial is here too. Lovely place to escape to.||December 13, 2017
Carla S||50||Is worth the visit, the lagoon and foutains are awesome. I mean, i went there just to see the squirrels, and there are tons of them, and pigeons lol, but is very cool. Take your time to visit, and relax, or go for a run.||December 13, 2017
clemyf||50||It was freezing clod so we didn't walk around much but we did enjoy our walk around the park. Its such a huge park. A great place to visit if the weather is good.||December 13, 2017
numerologi||30||We came in November, so Im sure its more pretty and amazing when its summertime. We only went there, cause we where going to Winter Wonderland, but if it was summer, we would have walked arround.||December 13, 2017
623eyh||40||We walked through this park which is large and saw lots of walkers/joggers/bicycles and sports happening. You just have to go a short distance from the traffic and it gets quiet and a great paved walk.||December 12, 2017
Meowy||40||I've been to Hyde Park years before and wasn't planning on going back until I heard from my hotel that they had a special exhibit for Christmas: Winter Wonderland. I decided to take a stroll through since it was a balmy high 50s, an amazing high for November in London. The park, is as usual, one of the nicer ones to stroll through in London. The Winter Wonderland exhibit is pretty interesting. They have quite a lot of rides and games set up, much like a carnival. Hyde Park is nice to visit any time of the year, but if you can make it for the Winter Wonderland exhibit it is highly recommended.||December 11, 2017
shradha k||30||Visited with some friends on a summer afternoon. It's a decent place to spend some time chilling, but London has better parks to offer.||December 11, 2017
terry D||40||We walked to the Diana memorial water feature which was lovely. We went to the Winter wonderland park, stalls and rides, very festive. Lots of wildlife, you can feed the birds from your arms. There is a café overlooking the river. Highly recommend.||December 11, 2017

degunduz75||50||Must go place to feel the spirit of London.Great outdoor area when the weather is good which is not frequent.The park has different sessions/ gardens.Overcrowded on sunny days, hard to find a seat on such days||December 10, 2017
Kellyke1||20||Now this is a judgement based on our experiences, Hyde Park can be actually quite nice. The evening we were there; visitors for winter wonderland were urged to walk faster. Then we heard trough the walkie talkies of the security that a lot of police were on their way because they were expecting a big stirr up because you had Christian demonstraters against Muslims. We got out of there quick and went to the Princess Diana memorial fountain before heading back to the hotel.||December 9, 2017
Clalunaba||50||Beautiful in all its aerea, lots of doggies playing around and lake, and Swan and boat and plenty of benches where to sit, marvellous Park. ||December 9, 2017
RASG_13||50||Visited Hyde park for the winter wonderland spectacular. Absolutely fantastic, visited ice carving exhibit -10c bloody cold but very good. Watched ice dance Cinderella on ice, again very good. The went on giant Ferris wheel as it got dark and lights on the other rides are stunning. Loads of Christmas craft stalls, food stalls and beer halls. Food is expensive as are the rides but a great day out. The fairground rides are huge, roller coasters galore, huge kids section and some giant adrenalin rides I have never seen before. All in all a great experience ||December 9, 2017
_audal1946||50||I found this park a real gem, so much to see and do or simply kick back and unwind, I went there most days whilst staying nearby!||December 9, 2017

MrQuiet1949||40||A cold afternoon but such an interesting park with so much to see. The Albert Memorial abs several memorials to Princess Diana. A hot drink at Kensington Palace then a look at the sunken garden. ||December 8, 2017
Bobbi B||50||Lovely park, great for adults and kids alike, lovely in summer for picnics, runs, or enjoy the sun ( when it does come out) nice playground for kids to play or take a ride on the rowing boats watching the lovely swans. ( Please do not leave your rubbish lying around as they end up in the water and can harm the swans, there are plenty of bins about) In winter you can enjoy Winter Wonderland, magical place for kids and adults alike, adults can get lovely Christmas gifts and enjoy some beautiful food and drinks while kids enjoy the attractions and rides. Make sure you have enough cash with you as some places only accept cash, also be prepared to wait a bit to get in the rides, wrap up well if you staying till late evening it can get pretty chilly at night. Make sure you charge your phones as you wont be able to charge them anywhere in there, you will want to take loads of photos. the place is Magical. Enjoy||December 8, 2017
Robin P||50||Lovely place to walk and enjoy the park and quiet but also to exercise and just enjoy. Lotsof space and things to look at. Fantastic amenity. ||December 7, 2017

Ted K||50||A lovely iconic park to walk through in the heart of London. We came and visited their Winter Wonderland- full with a fair and holiday lights and more. Watch what you bring with you as they are very strict on what goes in to the area for this and if you plan on going plan on showing up early as the line to get in gets very long. Was a beautiful park would recommend to anyone visiting to check out.||December 7, 2017
tufty1940||50||Very safe and central for an evening run. It's about 7k around the park taking in Kensington Gardens. Repeated in morning and even lovlier watching London waking up as you run by||December 7, 2017

Gbconkal||50||I prefer staying close to Hyde park when in London. Going for a morning run around the park is such a wonderful experience no mater the season. There are nice running, biking and walking tracks and alway plenty of people around. Tip: allow time for a coffee at the Italian Garden on the Bayswater side of the park. The view from the cafe is spectacular especially in the morning and the coffee is quite good too.||December 6, 2017
MrAWarren||40||Brought the young lad here for Winter Wonderland. The park is huge with a good lake. The Amusements where excellent for all ages. Highly recommend. Very central and only walks away||December 6, 2017
Suzytheexplorer||30||We were told by the underground staff to get off a stop early as they were expecting a lot of people going to Winter Wonderland so we go off at Green Park. We then had to wall for 20 minutes to even get to the Winter Wonderland gate. We had a great time walking around but you need a lot of money if you want to go on any of the rides as they ranged from £5 to £9 each. I would suggest pre-booking as many of the attractions as possible so that you get a bit of a discount. There's lots of lovely food and drink stalls plus loads of market stalls. When we went to leave, we found that we had to walk the long way round to Hyde Park Corner station and then get told it was closed along with any nearby tube stations and all the staff could offer as help is "there's bus stops over there". We were not impressed as we didn't know what to do or where to go. Ruined the whole day ||December 6, 2017
WILDSURFER2019||50||Lovely for walks and excercise, and if you got time look for the sculpture from an old famous artist Hudson himself,, its located by the green house by a little pondcheck it out||December 6, 2017

SimoneC5401||50||Hyde Park has been transformed into Winter Wonderland, and it is SO MUCH FUN, we visited 4 times during our 11-day holiday in London. Winter Wonderland transforms Hyde Park into a sparkling playground of rides, Christmas market, food stalls, and show areas. There is ice-skating too. The rides are crazy fun and it costs about 5 tokens for adults and 3 tokens for kids on average. The game stalls are a huge money-sucker (and I mean this in a nice way) - one can end up spending loads of money trying to win the prizes! hahahha! Lots of street food and nice variety too, including vegetarian options. Entry is free; bag-checks at the entrances; avoid Saturday night which tends to be very crowded. ||December 5, 2017
ellybeth||50||it’s very nice, cooling during winter:) it’s next to Kensington Gardens too!worth a trip  vastly spaced ||December 5, 2017

a_blackyy||50||I love Hyde park you can do a lot of activities in there you can feed the ducks and walk your dogs and good for reading walking relaxing and a bike ride almost everything , theres lots of statues at some points it’s one of my favorite spots in London , i recommended for dates or families or even solo ||December 5, 2017
Rossergruffydd||50||Walked here from St James's Park and found it well signposted. This is the venue for the huge 'Winter Wonderland' event that has a bit of everything. Your bags are thoroughly checked and it closes at 10pm which means a mad dash for the nearest Undergound stations which are fortunately numerous in the general vicinity. Watch out for your mobile phone, wallet, etc. as it gets very busy with lots of packed walkways, etc. The walking surfaces are mostly large plastic mats with a few areas of boardwalks.||December 5, 2017
garjobo79||30||Isnt London a rip-off! real shame, overcharging for everything! Winter wonderland looks lovely, but the rides are SO expensive..child and adult for a 2minute swing £14 I kid you not - £14!!!!! that's £14!! so the likes of Beckham and co won't bat an eyelid but c'on....funhouses adult £6, kid £5 ...and so it goes on and on and on.... a few decent £3 or £5 bottle toss games etc one of the circuses £12 or so is worth it.We went 6ish Monday night, slight queue to get in, didnt have time to look at the lovely market stalls ( so come earlier for all that -worth a look ) plenty to see. Rides were not too busy really, no real queues. Recommend ( for say...8 - 10yr olds and under ) the Alpine funhouse ( theres 2 or 3 of them, the Fire one my daughter said was good too ) but the Alpine house initally appear the usual slippy platforms ( bit dangerous re footing - need to get used too it ) - but then you go into a lift, a collasping bar, a falling roof and a swirling section. Its 'scarey', unexpected for little ones..but worth the price. So - dont miss that one. The smaller high swing is cheaper and lasts longer.Overall, plan your visit, know your tube, the park it 2 miles long so..get a map so your not walking, expect to pay at very least £60 for a rides....at the very least...but its a good night out.||December 5, 2017
lingiglondon||50||Late November is the time to go as they have Winter Wonderland set up through Christmas with Christmas markets, many many rides, amazing choices of places to eat; an ice show; ice figures, skating and so much more.||December 4, 2017

gingertravel2019||50||We went up to london for wintet wonderland. It didnt disappoint it was great lots to see and do. In the day time we spent some time in the park taking in the views of the lake. The whole place is beautiful. Lots of food places and attractions nearby. Easy to get to via public transport.||December 4, 2017

HR8283||40||If you are visting in Winter, then you have to check the Winter Wonderland installed inside the park. The duck lake is on the other side, it is a good walk but it was very cold.||December 3, 2017
Mi N||50||We had been in a very cold period of time, but it was wonderful. The birds flying over your head and you feel a bit like in Hitchcock's movie. Beautiful, green, we haven't been to Winter Wonderland because there were way too much people trying to get inside. ||December 3, 2017
wfmt||20||Nice park unfortunately a lot of "suspicious fellas" trying to take advantage of the tourist .Try the park in the morning when is not so crowned and avoid the contact with this " friendly suspicious pickpoketers" ||December 3, 2017
Aileen B||50||Went to the winter wonderland, was amazing, food was also great would go back. Feet very sore at the end of day LOL.||December 3, 2017
Les F||30||There is so much to do for everyone, the circus although very small was highly funny and very entertaining. The rides and sideshows in most cases were really expensive, up by about 70% on last year ( crazy really as due to the amount of visitors I’m sure they’d make more profit by not overcharging), we heard lots of comments from people complaining about the costs, and walking away from the rides and sideshows due to the cost.However saying all that we still enjoyed ourselves until it was time to go home, then we had the nightmare of not being allowed into Hyde Park Corner underground as it was too busy to allow passengers ( which was crazy because the ratio was 90% coming to the park against 10% trying to go home, the option we were told was walk about 10 minutes down the road to Knightsbridge station which is not on the line we wanted.Have been and taken the grand kids for the last few years, but probably won’t go again anymore.||December 3, 2017
MonaB1980||40||This is a nice park to stroll around - it's December, so we didn't really linger. It also hosts the Winter Wonderland, which is good if you are going there (and fun) and you just need to know what part of the park to avoid if you don't want to go to the Winter Wonderland. Saw lots of people running.||December 3, 2017
Avi_Persaud||40||Large park in the middle of London. Pretty year round. Theres always lots to see. Very well maintained.||December 3, 2017
Gdreviewer1205||50||Besides the title I gave there is one down side to this attraction. It is extremely busy and there are not many places to sit down and enjoy your food. However besides these two points. It is he best Christmas market I have ever been too. There is heaps to see and do. We spent 3 hour here and there was still heaps to do. I would recommend 4 or 5 hours especially if you want to go on the rides. There is also a circus and Cinderella shows on ice here. You can purchase tickets online to sped up the process. If you intend on coming to this attraction make sure that you allow at least 45 mins to get through the line. Also the underground stations are extremely congested at this location so be prepared. Please note that according to the signs, pick pocketing is common at this location. So keep an eye on your belongings. ||December 3, 2017

RAKlein||50||I'd arrived in London on an overnight flight and decided to wander through the park to get some exercise and to clear my head. It was a chilly day, but I dressed warmly and the park proved a wonderful place to enjoy being outdoors. I started in the centre (south side) of the park and walk around and through to the end toward St. Jame's Park, and then on the north side all the way to Kensington Gardens. I got "lost" a couple of times along the way, but there was signage that helped get me back on track. This is an actively used park, so there are people around and it is virtually safe. The gardens are very nice, and they are clean and well-maintained. I hadn't planed to go to Kensington Gardens (and Kensington Palace), but the walking was so pleasant I just ended up there. If one is into wandering around, and enjoy a park area with birds etc, then you can't go wrong. In warmer weather it is likely a much busier place, but even when chilly it is worth the time.||December 3, 2017

michellec102||50||Came here on 26/11/17 with my husband to visit the winter wonderland it was a fantastic time , the park is massive very happy. Would recommend to everyone ||December 2, 2017
jacqui43||50||We spent another brilliant morning here with a visit to the Ice Kingdom and it was great. We had a drink in the bar which looked like a lodge with the welcome fire pits The Magic Kingdom was worth every penny what work went into preparing the ice sculptors, wrap up warm though as it's freezing! The shops are ok but the same thing each year so didn't buy anything. Well worth a visit and will be there again next year!||December 2, 2017
cemre85||50||Lovely place to be even if it's freezing cold outside. We had a short walk around The Royal Parks with squirrels and swans. Was lovely, well maintained! You wouldnt expect this beauty right in the middle of London city centre||December 2, 2017
MgdaleneI||50||I walked through this park several times. Each time am in London, I make sure I don't miss it. Driving pass gently and slowly -the traffic will make you- gives you even a better view. I took several pictures because I just love this place. You will love it too||December 1, 2017
Northern_Ibis||40||We delayed visiting famous Hyde Park until late November. It's a vast public area, so it would take multiple visits to get to know it.We arrived on a partly sunny afternoon. We headed for the rose garden, which was looking beat up, unsurprisingly, but we then saw some pleasant plantings of pansies and primroses that were both in bloom. We then strolled along the Serpentine to the Diana Memorial, which is designed to be contemplative but is not very arresting. Next to it is the Isis (Ibis) monument, which is attractive and kind of interesting. Unfortunately the Serpentine Gallery on the other side of the bridge was closed due to a new installation that I should have liked to have seen. Crossing the bridge, we spied a tree full of rose-ringed parakeets, which were quite a sight on a November day. We then circulated through the park toward the "Winter Wonderland" event area, taking the long way around. We took a break at the cafe by the Serpentine Lake beforehand. The cafe is adequate but not great. There are a great many birds and a lot of bird feeding going on at the water's edge outside of the cafe. You can see quite a variety of urban birds there. Winter Wonderland is a fairly large "fun fair" with various mechanical rides and many winter-themed food courts offering Bavarian and "northern" themed fare such as bratwurst, Swedish meatballs, mulled wine, and other fairly pedestrian culinary distractions. I am not sure why the British are so fond of drinking beer outdoors on a cold and dreary day, but there you have it. We stopped off at Thor's, which imitates, loosely, a Viking dining hall, where we enjoyed English ale and Swedish meatballs--go figure. There were various Christmas-themed things on sale at the stalls, and also, rather improbably, an enormous number of puffy dolphins. While the Winter Wonderland seemed very popular with visitors, this is something a sensible person only needs to do once.||December 1, 2017
bipind2017||40||One of the best man made Nature creativity in London. Hyde park is one of the largest park in London. Calm,quiet,clean place. You can have boating for a small price. A must visit place||December 1, 2017
RileyStarling||50||Amazing place for a romantic walk around, would 100% go again if I happen to find myself in London :)||December 1, 2017
jddecuollo||50||Whether it's during the holiday season or not, I recommend taking some time to walk through the park. I would say it rivals Central Park in NY. Great for runs and for dog runs! I went to Winter Wonderland and that was equally as impressive.||December 1, 2017
sansoni24||50||It is a wonderful park, and as you take a walk in the park you feel that you are completely away from the city. You are lost in the silence and only the noise of the children playing. Just walking there is a pleasure. Kids had a good time running around and chasing squirrels. A Must visit||December 1, 2017
beththorne98||50||Going for a romantic walk in hyde park is one of the best in london, especially with a starbucks. evening runs round the lake with friend is also interesting as it makes fitness more interesting. And right now, Winterwonderlnd would be amazing!||November 30, 2017
lukebotham||50||Lovely park and sculptures. Walk goes through the 4 major parks. Make sure to go in the memorial fountain if it’s a hot day !||November 30, 2017
lucyfC6996MM||40||This park is massive. There is a lovely restaurant on the lake for food and drinks and if the weather is nice it is absolutely beautiful. We then took a ride on a pedalo around the lake. Lovely birds too||November 30, 2017
lesleyloulou||30||Amazing time here plenty of attractions to suit everyone. ice skating, Cinderella on ice, we visited the ice bar a bit pricey but it is London great cocktails thermal capes & gloves provided. Plenty of food huts & bars to suit everyone. ||November 29, 2017
Jovial D||50||One can feel completely isolated if immersed in the surroundings or can feel in the midst of an ocean of humanity. its all in the mind. Worth a visit.||November 29, 2017
seanworc||50||This is the major park in Central London. Boundaries cover Mayfair, Marylebone, Knightsbridge, and Kensington areas. Much to do inside the park. We took a lovely walk along the Serpentine Lake where the swans tend to be. In good weather, there are boats for rental. Strolled and paused at the Lady Diana Memorial Garden. Watch the HorseGuard's ride by on the horse track. There are two small art galleries, the Serpentine Gallery and the Sackler Serpentine gallery. Of course, the world famous Speaker's Corner, a living monument to free speech. For history buffs, the outline of the 1800s Crystal Palace Exhibition Hall, a show of the world's industrial might, is remembered. Well worth a stop and stroll for a couple of hours. Free.||November 29, 2017
Dean D||50||We had a lovely walk around Hyde Park whilst waiting to go into winter wonderland, the park is well kept and well worth a visit.||November 29, 2017
jaideep||50||Loved the park and its landscape with massive open spaces and the lake. Great place for a morning run/walk. ||November 29, 2017
happyblacky5999||50||There had a very fantastic winter wonderland here, the Christmas decorations insides were fabulous and amazing, spent 2 hours here still cant finish it! It is too huge, fun fair is highly recommended but the price is a little bit expensive, lots of food stalls and souvenir stalls! The only problem is hard to find the exit!||November 29, 2017
101jumper||40||We were quite surprised to run across a traditional German Christmas market in the heart of London. This is what American festivals should be like - safe, clean, good food, proper staffing and very well maintained. The market had a mix of stalls offering food, drinks, rides, games and a bit of shopping - including even a pocket watch stand. The rides are overpriced, but well done. Crowds were large, but manageable with good security on hand. The remainder of the park is perfect for strolling, feeding the birds (watch out for the swans) or simply pausing to watch the world.||November 28, 2017
RoDAl123||40||Visited last week and weather was amazing .this park has a lot of greenry and small lake.Highly recommended place to visit while you are in london ||November 28, 2017
MetalMama2310||50||We travel from Slough with our dog to Hyde park, and it is always so pleasant. Beautiful walk and scenery. Great for dogs as well! Tea shop at the end of the Serpentine river is so good. Very good prices too.||November 28, 2017
Juan Carlos A||50||Amazing park, a lot of wild life, clean and you can rest from the busy life style of london. I recommend to go for a quick walk.||November 27, 2017
Brian M||50||Great place to go for a stroll brisk walk or jog Plenty of pop up cafes and more expensive ones Some toilets||November 27, 2017
trinni31||30||Visited on Fri night wasn't overcrowded and had great weather. Was concerned it would be mucky but not at all the earth was covered with flooring and all tidy and clean indeed. It's very much a funfair with elements of German market but nice vibe. If you like rides, stall foods and all these fairground things then its the place to go. A few quirky stages and bars that revolved quite funny as the more you drink the less appealing that may become.... Funny! ||November 27, 2017
bewilliams01983||50||This park has everything for a tourist looking for a glimpse of everyday London....people walking their dogs, bustling to work. Lovely paved paths to walk and jog, or just take a shortcut to museums on Exhibition Road.||November 26, 2017
Richard D||40||Hyde Park is home to christmas fun and market--grown considerable in past few years. Food and gifts, as well as, rides. ||November 26, 2017
vitara00||50||we walked through the park while in london and it was fab , open space in a big city with birds eating out of peoples hands , squirrels and scenery, coffee in the palace coffee shop, a must do ||November 26, 2017
Karen F||40||Visited on a rainy, dull day. Was disappointed as the event looked like a cross between a fun fair and a market. Food and drink expensive although there is no entry fee. Looked at lot better once it went dark and the lights went on.||November 26, 2017
daveinkent44||50||Always love visiting this park. For me it's the best of the royal parks. With Marble Arch on one side and speakers corner to the south. The serpentine is lovely. I always find this as a really relaxing place to visit to get away from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding streets.||November 26, 2017
JCW703||40||We went to the winter wonderland extravaganza in Hyde Park. The park itself is a very nice, well cared for green space, the extravaganza was / is a Christmas Market on steroids. Honestly more a carnival / theme park, they had a wide variety of vendors, both for food and crafts as well as many carnival rides. A very pleasant getaway in the heart of London.||November 26, 2017
Joanne J||50||From its rich royal recreational connections, to its positioning right in the middle of one of the World's best cities...a day in Hyde Park is a "Must". The natural footprint of the park still exists in all its glory. No perfectly manicured and planned grounds here, just huge avenues and thoroughfares of beautiful nature, with historical landmarks and follies throughout the park. The water of the Serpentine brings further to mind the park's sense of serenity. The Italian Gardens and its love story is enchanting. The Park is also the home of the Princess Diana Water Feature, plus the Diana Memorial Children's Playground, located right next to the wonderful historical carousel. Kensington Palace and those very famous Gates are also so very, very easily accessed 100 metres or so from the entrance off of Bayswater Road. There are all the usual facilities scattered throughout the park, but the little coffee shop, adjacent to the Children's Playground, is a delight whatever time of the day. Well worth a day out.||November 26, 2017

tempo1962||50||Visited Winter Wonderland twice during our 2 night stay in London.The park is bigger than expected for being in the capital city. The Winter Wonderland was great free attraction with lots of fairground rides, Christmas stalls, eateries and bars. It also has shows and a large ice rink.Security is well in evidence and makes you feel safe. This is a free event with no entrance charges.This is a must if you visit London in November or December. Transport by underground is both safe and plentiful.||November 25, 2017
Bruce_Baumbush||50||Hyde Park and the adjacent Kensington Gardens/Palace in a must visit spot in London if you are there for a few days. In the summer you can rent little boats on the pond and in the winter there is a festival certain months with food, music, rides and sellers in a medieval atmosphere. Lots of concerts throughout the year too. The Princess Diana memorial is also something to seek out.||November 25, 2017
Linda K||50||We stopped in the park for about an hour whilst we had a picnic. We sat by the Albert Memorial on a lovely autumn day and the younger children ran through the fallen leaves. It was a lovely experience - taking a few quiet moments to relax before hitting the museums.||November 24, 2017
JaninedeBric||50||I've visited Hyde Park each time I've stayed in London, and this time I was delighted by a curious happenstance: As we traversed the park along the West Carriage Drive and crossed the bridge over the Serpentine, we noticed the trees on either side full of bright green parrots! We understood these to be non-native (of course) species that had either escaped or been set free by those who brought them into the UK. The references to Monty Python aside, the sight brightened up a gray November day. I just worry that they make it through the cold months ahead.||November 24, 2017
803tinaj||20||Fantastic green park, stress down, read a book, let the kids have fun in the playground. Freash breed in a hectic city! ||November 23, 2017
Kathy M||50||for anyone who loves the outdoors this Park is great for walking, cycling,running, galloping with your horse. Reminds me of Central Park in NYC. Stop by the Italian Gardens and sip some cappuccino..great area- no cost||November 23, 2017
Swapnil J||50||That space in the city where you can just sit and relax, have a picnic or just go for a jog. Large open space right in the heart of the city and a must visit when you are on the city tour.||November 23, 2017
daymoLiverpool||50||We wanted to celebrate Christmas together as friends so came here for a part of the day to get us in the mood. This place didn’t let us down but got us into a great festive mood. It’s quite large and has something for everyone, shows, rides, shops, bars, drinks, festive decorations and people being in a festive mood. We had a good mooch around and had a meat bar cake and a wine which was also good/ we only spent about 1 hour and half as we had other plans but could have easily spent longer. ||November 22, 2017
AnnieM452||50||We had time to spare before heading home and the park was just a stroll away. It was a beautiful sunny Sunday morning and a real pleasure to be there. Lots of people dog walking, some others doing boot camp and others just simply walking and making the most of a lovely day.Winter wonderland is on at the moment so there were people queuing to get in there - we didn’t bother. Incredible space in the middle of the city and it’s free!||November 22, 2017
susan198269||50||I cant really comment on the park itself because we went to the Winter Wonderland which was amazing. First time I have ever been, and I can not wait to go again, we went Saturday afternoon until closing 10pm and then again the next morning. I would recommend people to book in advance when you can especially ice bar, and Haute Bar. Also please remember to take cash with you as some places don't except card there are ATM machines unsure if its free service. An average ride was around £9 pp and you can pay on card as well at the ticket kiosks. The most popular ride and enjoyable was the loop ride (thinks its called something like that I remember its a 5 hoop rollacoster. we went twice. Haute Bar - was amazing worth every penny its a booth which you can book out for you and your mates to do karaoke (all Christmas songs around 18) whilst you get served with drinks and food obvs that's an additional cost. I really loved it - amazingBar Ice - Ive been to one in Spain and to be honest its really small and I don't think it was worth it but it was all sold out.Cinderella on Ice - we didn't need to book advance for these - this was really nice - defo for family and kids.overall amazing experience im just upset that I missed all these years out before make sure you go family and couples and just friends Make sure u wrap up warm gets cold in the evenings||November 21, 2017
europewithKellynRyan||50||This park is in the heart of London. It has a very large open space, lakes, walk/jog/bike paths and statues. We rented bikes and ended up needing to use them on the busy roads too. Very scary! Stay in the park and enjoy the safety of nature and people watching.||November 21, 2017
Martie227||50||After a huge breakfast we went for a stroll through the park and it was just glorious. The trees that still had leaves were decked out in beautiful shades of gold, and photographed well. Dogs stalking something had us scratching our heads until we spotted the squirrels, it was just so funny to watch, as the dogs stood no chance of catching anything that quick!Plenty of people were out feeding the ducks on the lake and the local kiddies football dads had pitches laid out and a training programme in place for the teams. Everyone was happy with whatever they were doing, walking the dog, taking a walk, jogging, training, or just sitting on a bench watching the world go by. Hard to be believe all this was happening in one of the busiest capitals of the world, just joyous.||November 21, 2017
KatieG1997||50||I still can't believe how big this place is. It always has something going on and is a great place to grab some sun and have some cans with friends. Just make sure you pick a place to meet your friends or you'll spend hours trying to find them!||November 21, 2017
Fatima J||50||Spent more than 3 hours here still couldn't explore the whole place. It is a must visit if you wish to spend a day in serenity.||November 20, 2017

359rjb||30||Hyde Park contains some stunning views and it was strange to see so may swans so comfortable with so may visitors taking pictures in very close proximity. The Serpentine cafe offers lovely scenery whilst having a drink. I did find Speakers Corner rather disappointing though.||November 20, 2017

Yara A||50||We arrived in London on Christmas afternoon and our hotel was right nearby. Everything else was closed so we decided to take a walk in the afternoon in Hyde Park, all the way to the Albert Memorial. The park was nice, very reminiscent of its New York counterpart, Central Park. But by the time we reached the Albert Memorial, the sun was setting (around 4 pm) and we started heading back the other direction towards our hotel. By the time we reached one of the north gates, it was LOCKED! We searched for another exit and it too was LOCKED! We didn't have a choice but climb over the tall fencing. Felt like we were breaking out of a prison. Definitely an interesting visit to Hyde Park on Christmas afternoon.Moral of the story: get out of the park before it closes (check the closing times), or you'll be trapped inside like we were.||November 18, 2017
Oğuz A||50||This is the lung of London. Where you can find peace get fresh air and spend time with your family.I like running and Hyde Park is one of the best location to do running.On winter you can find some festivals.It is quite big that you can walk through the whole park in 45 min.||November 17, 2017

Canadiantravellers5||50||We really enjoyed our time in this huge, beautiful park. There was so much to see and do, something to satisfy everyone. There were a number of plant and trees species, as well as birds. The lake was beautiful, with a number of water birds. There was a few coffee vendors throughout the park as well as 2 or 3 restaurants. Of course there is Kensington Palace, which has beautiful gardens. We spent a few hours there over a few days. I was impressed at how well it was maintained. Loved it!||November 15, 2017

Terry C||40||A really relaxing place to take a stroll, if you have children with you, you can always feed the ducks. There is the large Serpentine lake in the middle of the park, if you are feeling energetic you can always hire a rowing boat, or if it is a nice day, you can just sit and eat your lunch whilst people watching||November 13, 2017

Jan295||50||Ideally situated next to our hotel meant we had no excuse for not taking a stroll everyday. Sunday morning a shared delight watching the model yacht racers on the pond. The tinkling fountains of the Italian Gardens accompanied the sound of families enjoying the park. Take a red apple through Lancaster Gate and you wil soon be surrounded by a host of colourful parakeets||November 13, 2017
James H||40||"No I'm not crazy", said the wife! Turns out there really are bright green parakeets flying around Hyde Park. Who knew! We've been here a few times since. Its a breath of fresh air to visit a large green park in the middle of one of the biggest Cities in the world. You can unwind and forget about the urban sprawl of London for free.||November 13, 2017

Barry S||50||Even on a chilly day in winter, Hyde Park has much to offer. We walked through the lovely parkland to see the stark reminder of 'The Holocaust Memorial' and then od to the lovely lake of the Serpentine. We enjoyed watching the Black Swans and the Egyptian Geese which were prominent. Step inside the cafe to warm up!||November 12, 2017
Yas46||50||We have visited Hyde Park at different times of the year and it is always beautiful. At the moment the Autumn leaves, squirrels etc make it a must for Autumn lovers. The winter wonderland opens soon, I believe, which gives another aspect. We took nuts to feed the squirrels with and had fun feeding the bright green parakeets as well. The lake with the swans, geese and other wildfowl is simply lovely...and you can "people watch" as long as you like.||November 12, 2017
alt2007||50||Walking through Hyde Park, seeing lots of different memorials and statues. It was very peaceful and lovely to see geese, birds and squirrels around. We stopped off at Serpentines for lunch over looking the lake, which was very pleasant.||November 12, 2017

Andrew F||50||Took a shortcut through the park just to get away from the traffic ended up sitting on a bench and looking at the wildfowl and the others passes by very relaxing in a manic day I would always take 10 minutes out to chill in the park if possible||November 11, 2017
anne marie G||50||I regularly enjoy a long walk around the serpentine in Hyde park, feeding the multitude of birdlife . We usually finish our "exercise " with a delicious repast of dim sum at Kam Tong restaurant 3 minutes walk outside Hyde Park at the Queensway exit.If walking before 10am we go to the Serpentine Bar where the croissants are better than in France !||November 11, 2017
LostALot22||40||It's really nice to have so much green space in such a large and old city. London seems to have a lot of it. This park is really big and nice. The water is nice. A good spot for a walk. ||November 10, 2017
AnnaCPass||50||Hyde Park is so lovely with a variety of attractions like art sculptures, playgrounds and different gardens. Its true the English do gardens best, its lovely to just grab a coffee and get lost in Hyde Park. One of my new favorite things to do in London.||November 10, 2017
alisonmarieb||50||Our hotel was in Paddington and on a sunday afternoon we strolled through. It's huge and has plenty to look at. Lots of memorials and statues and dogs everywhere!!! If you're a big dog person, highly recommend stopping by, just to see the many breeds of dogs that are either walking or playing with their owners. There's also a few ponds with lots of geese and other birds. Really cool and relaxing environment. 10/10 would recommend.||November 10, 2017
aylam521||50||Wonderful green space in the heart of London. Great for walks or just sitting around and watching the world go by.||November 10, 2017
kavitaRM||50||London offers these amazing sanctuaries in the middle of the city - nothing beats it. Feed some birds - play with the squirrels and if you are luck y to be here in autumn, see the loverly spread of the dry leaves...||November 10, 2017
13BrittD||50||We walked through Hyde Park and saw so many wonderful views. It was fall and all the trees are turning. So many wonderful colours. Lots of fountains and statues to look at. We stopped to watch the swans at the Round Pond. Its an easy walk, paved paths on level ground. You can rent bikes to ride. There are a few cafes along the way. ||November 9, 2017
Pateena S||50||Hyde Park is a beautiful park to walk through.... at the moment the Autumn leaves are lovely there are so many squirrels in the park and so many photos to be taken!! Just so much to be seen in this park!!||November 9, 2017
Dit_fromage||50||Take time out from your day of shopping in Knightsbridge and head here for some peace and quiet. Visit Kensington Palace and the Diana Memorial whilst here.||November 9, 2017
daffystjob||40||On a beautifully sunny day, nothing beats a nice park, and this park in autumn is pretty nice. Loads of dried leaves with a load of squirrels and birds foraging for food. You forget you're in a hugely busy and overpopulated city. Due to some event in the park (I think it was a circus), there were some areas which weren't accessible and although the fencing around it was green, it was still a little unsightly. The surprise of the visit...the parakeets, we spotted at least 5 of these bright green birds around a bird feeder, they held their own against the pigeons but struggled to get the nuts out.||November 9, 2017
ColetteEP||50||As a child used to get myself immersed in Hyde park and as a very senior person I still enjoy it as much!||November 8, 2017
PItexpat||50||Pretty flowers , wide open spaces and traditional tea rooms. This park has it all ! It is good for all ages and you can always pop into the serpentine gallery for some the latest art offering . ||November 8, 2017
julialogan1982||50||Hyde Park is one of the many must see attractions to see when visiting London. It's stunning and you will forget that you are in the middle of a busy city. It's a nice relaxing break when doing all the sightseeing. ||November 8, 2017
Vladka11||50||Hyde Park is my favorite park in London. :)) Hype park is huge and nice. I always have a hotel near Hyde Park and I always go there. I have always time to feed squirrels and swans. :)) In every season the park is magical. :))||November 8, 2017
123anamariai||50||In my opinion, the Albert Memorial is the most striking feature of Hyde Park, but Wellington and Marble Archs, the Speakers Corner, Diana's memorial, the serpentine, the statues, and especially Kensington Palace are unmissable.||November 8, 2017
sonsonator||50||Our first day in London was filled with gorgeous sunshine and so we spent it leisurely walking around Hyde Park. From gorgeous trails to the expansive Serpentine, to the many statues littering the grounds, it's a beautiful and tranquil place to spend a half day ||November 8, 2017
VaibhavIndore||50||Always wanted to visit after reading about it (isn't it elementary, Dr Watson). Was amazed by it during a morning run I took there, breathtaking it was.. phew :).||November 8, 2017
isabeaup2016||40||Very nice, large and calm park to walk and enjoy the nature. We also went to Kensington Palace and visited the exposition. This was a nice experiance, but was rather expensive.||November 7, 2017
KathleenGaza||50||Hyde Park is just amazing! We had decided to walk from Marble Arch through the park to Harrod's, and thoroughly enjoyed it. There were cyclists and horses, ducks and dogs, ponds and flowers, a wedding photo shoot, and best of all, cheeky little squirrels posing for my camera! A great place for a stroll or a picnic.||November 7, 2017
Stephen R||50||When in London I always visit Hyde park for a good walk especially on Sunday morning,speakers corner always for a good laugh,plus it's free ,great||November 7, 2017

JimBmore57||50||Before visiting London,I was unaware of how many parks there were within the city. Hyde Park is a great place to hang with friends, eat a meal, and enjoy the outdoors.Well worth a visit.||November 6, 2017
Juan Antonio G||50||I did this tour of 8 km running, it is like the perfect combination, long enough, different landscapes, people running everywhere but as the place is high there is not any problem with it. Cycling is properly separated so no disturbing at any moment.Nice run!||November 6, 2017
stephencamburn||50||Hyde Park is the largest Park in London but not the oldest: the oldest park is St James's. It is hard to believe that since the middle ages and until well into the eighteenth century, Hyde Park was inhabited by deer, wild boar and even wild bulls, hunted for sport. Duels were fought there, one of the most famous duellists being Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the Irish playwright ('School for Scandal' and 'The Critic') who survived the ordeal.But in the nineteenth century, Hyde Park was finally tamed and made to look very much as it does now. The Serpentine Lake was laid out according to a serpentine Line of Beauty, still fashionable at the time. And in the twentieth Century, the Serpentine art gallery was built for temporary exhibition of contemporary art.The Great Exhibition of 1851 was built in Hyde Park, known at the time as Crystal Palace (so-called because it was constructed using glass). It was so big, mature grees were growing inside it. After the Great Exhibition was over, the Crystal Palace was moved to South London where it was later destroyed in a fire.If you have all day to wander round Hyde Park, your effort will be rewarded by what you stumble upon: George Watt's equestrian statue known as 'Physical Energy' - in a surprisingly modern style; Speakers' Corner; the Queen Elizabeth Gate (theatrical? or kitsch?), Apsley House with the Hyde Park Screen built next to it, and in the middle of the huge traffic island on Hyde Park Corner, the monumnetal Wellington Arch, designed by Decimus Burton with a gigantic quadriga of bronze horses on top and the smallest police station in London built into its base.Visitors old enough to remember St George's Hospital on Hyde Park Corner will now find it completely transformed into the Lanesborough Hotel, one of the best hotels in London with wonderful views. And on the other side of the square, the InterContinetal Hotel has been fully restored in recent years.For children, in Hyde Park there is the Peter Pan monument which admittedly takes some finding: just keep asking for directions. But on your way, you can't help noticing that the Park itself is maintained to the highest standard with flowerbeds and rose-pergolas attended to by gardeners on a daily basis, especially in the summer.You can hire a boat and row on the Serpentine Lake. Or you can walk across Hyde Park from the Serpentine to Marble Arch and Oxford Street. There are some pop-up cafes here and there in Hyde Park, with a permanent cafe on the edge of the Serpentine Lake in the area known as the Lido. Otherwise, loos can be evasive.To end on an important safety note, Hyde Park Corner is swarming with traffic, constantly changing lanes. Do not attempt to cross it! Instead, please use the very convenient pedestrian underpass which has a period feel (and a smell) all of its own! ||November 6, 2017
Vasileios S||40||The park is beautiful and very large to enjoy a nice walk. The park is full of swans gooses, ducks, squirrels, pigeons and seagulls. You can manage to enjoy great sunsets while being in the centre of the city.||November 6, 2017
BDGFN||50||I wish I would have had more time to explore this park, but the small portion I did see was beautiful. They were beginning to set up for the Christmas festival. I think that might be a great time to visit again!||November 5, 2017
AprilForbes||50||What a fantastic evening.......From the moment we arrived at 3.30 to the moment we left, a great time was had by all.We met two lovely couples who we stayed with and shared a wonderful experience.We had plenty of drink, which is always a bonus, a great location and good companions.You can always buy food or drink inside and I have to admit, it was reasonably priced. Our chips were to die for.The atmosphere was amazing and the acts werent too bad neither. I sung and danced the night away.It is well worth the trip wherever you are travelling from - it will certainly become a yearly activity for us.||November 5, 2017
moyni76||50||Visited with family and had a great day ! Lovely sunny day,went on the boats and visited the memorial which has a bit of a splash pool.loads going on ||November 5, 2017
891basilt||50||A beautiful park, extremely well-kept. There are a few cafes with British classics (fish and chips, etc) and a good section of beers and wines, to my surprise all reasonably priced. The location is great, you can easily combine a great walk the park with a visit to one of the great museums (V&A, Science, Natural History). Enjoy on a nice day!||November 4, 2017
P4136DDalessiog||50||It is a very nice park, with lots of squirrels and crows u can feed. There are several internal historical monuments and memorials to Queen Victoria, King Albert and Princess Diana, and u can also enter in the Kensington palace and have a not very cheap tea with some others who like u want to know how could it be being a member of the royal family (who I guess wouldn't like too much being having tea at Hyde park, but this is another story). At the north of the park there is also a playground for children||November 4, 2017

dantho||40||London is so lucky to have their Royal Parks. Hyde Park in particular is a great place to get away from it all. Yes, there are roads going around the park but you can get away from it all if you find your way towards the Serpentine nd the central areas of the park. It does get busy but there is still plenty of room for everyone.||November 3, 2017
clares366||40||This park is huge, it was a very windy morning in the wake of hurricane Brian but a refreshing bracing walk, with wall to wall dogs! We did not notice any poo which was a plus! Lots of joggers and cyclists, it is near where they house the horses from the guard and they have a training area here. We would like to visit again to see Kensington Palace. It had lots going on parks, tea rooms, boating lakes, etc.||November 3, 2017
trendyvicar||50||A great place for a walk to escape the town bustle. Large and plenty of trees for shade in the summer as well as grass areas to sit down. Worth exploring. ||November 2, 2017
Sixonthego_50||50||Visit the Lido or one of the restaurants for a snack. Walk aroung the Serpentine lake. Truly beautiful.. Mind the squirrels. ||November 2, 2017
mrtheedge7||40||It makes for a good stroll in the afternoon or evening. I was here for the British Summer Time concert series. That's recommended, if you are looking for something to do in June/July. The park doesn't have much on some other big cities, but it's nice.||November 2, 2017
CaptainTrenchard||50||This park is one of the biggest in London. During summer you can easily spend the whole day here. There is plenty to do, one can go cycling, roller skating and even horse riding. There is the lake where you can take a boat out for an hour or so, and even several food places. And even if you’re just feeling lazy well that’s fine too as there is plenty of spaces where you can just lie down and relax.The park is also used for music concerts and during winter time becomes the Winter wonderland.||November 2, 2017
missimodo||50||A huge park, used by tourists & locals alike. Great for cycling, walking, running, skating, horse riding....||November 2, 2017
Marcel-MG||50||Very nice park for a stroll or run! A pretty large piece of nature in the city. Plenty of tracks for cycling and running. Encountered more squirrels and geese than people on my early morning run!||November 2, 2017
AdamOr1||50||A really beutiful place, with lots of space for everyone who wants to run, jog do yoga or just have a walk around to feed the various types of animals you can see there... A very calm place in the heart of London.||November 2, 2017
Birah D||50||London is just like any other international city. If you're visiting, Hyde park is a MUST to take in some of the beauty this place has to offer. Great for a lunch break or even just a stroll. ||November 1, 2017
ronyr813||50||This park is one of the best running parks I've ever been. It has paths for every taste. More rural, next to the city, urban. You can run next to the pond alongside swans and ducklings. The illumination in the early morning isn't great though.||November 1, 2017
Victoria G||50||Hyde park is a classic for wanderers and travellers like myself. If you want to take a relaxing stroll through the naturesque alotment of London, Hyde park is where to do it. It is enormous and provides lots of space to sit if you want to rest your feet.||November 1, 2017
Greg_Presley||50||My best advice for enjoying Hyde Park as it is relatively crowded (though it would be hard considered how large it is) is to go in the center through serpentine and then aim right or left under the trees as there are less people visiting this area, hence it is more quiet. If you want to get to see a few things, then the Kensington Gardens side of it is better (the west side) as you can see Kensington Palace, the residence of Prince William and Princess Kate Middleton Goldsmith. If you are looking for a place for Brunch, there is one right in the center of Hyde park at Serpentine. ||November 1, 2017
Jean H||50||Hyde Park!!!! So cool to have walked through this park. I was amazed by all the activity including well behaved dogs off leashes. I loved the water with all the swans. It was just wonderful to be here.||October 31, 2017

i2Wander||50||Looking for tranquility in the heart of London? This place is for you!! Avoid Speaker's Corner on Sundays as people from different backgrounds gather to discuss everything under the sun. Feeding the ducks is not permitted. Please take care of your own waste.

Susan C||40||We visited Hyde park for the first time during our recent trip to London, it's a very large but relaxing place to visit and in places feels quite tranquil which is amazing as it's right in the heart of London. We also visited the Princess Diana memorial garden/fountain while we was there, we was surprised by how dignified it was and the fountain was quite beautiful. ||October 30, 2017
477aliciaw||50||Hyde Park is large and has a lot of different paths to go on. They were wide enough that we didn’t feel crowded, although there were a lot of other people there. The trees and flowers were lovely. The geese and swans are hilarious. The swans are huge! We cut through to go somewhere else and we’re glad we did!||October 30, 2017
mansireddy||40||It’s a massive park with many paths and walk ways. The water bodies have geese and its great to see them swim. There are many benches to relax and unwind after a long day.||October 30, 2017
Red_Bus_Zeal||50||Whenever I can manage to get from A - B via Hyde Park rather than on the tube or bus, that is the way I go. It is glorious in all seasons. A particular pleasure in summer is swimming in the Serpentine - magical. You can take a picnic to enjoy in the Lido grounds or pop out and buy things from the Serpentine cafe.||October 30, 2017
dimoo||50||You must bike this whole park! Also go see the princess Diana exhibit. The memorial was beautifully done. When you rent bikes watch out for little kids looking over your shoulder...they'll steal your code and the bike! Happened to me but thank goodness one of the three boys got caught else I would've been out 150£!||October 30, 2017
Troy M||50||Hyde Park is very nice to walk around. The parks is very big with many intersecting paths. The water has many geese and swans. Benches are plentiful if you need a rest. There are a few eateries to grab a quick bite and restrooms are adjacent. Peaceful Park||October 29, 2017
Andrea A||50||We went in a very hot day and was very refreshing, having a big park in the middle of the city make people escape from the daily routine and unwind||October 29, 2017
Kerry B||50||massive park plenty of space and play areas especially the Diana memorial playground. Also worth a visit is the Diana memorial in summer able to paddle in water.

jharnarohra||50||We were staying In Paddington and Hyde park was very close to our hotel. It is a huge park with small ponds in between of the park. The pond has swans and ducks swimming making it even more beautiful. You will see taking walk or a jog, some cycling around, kids playing around, some taking a lunch break to just take the view. It is a nice relaxing spot while running around to see London.||October 29, 2017
Lianne D||50||Favorite park in London. Great for a long walk or a run. Also fantastic for a picnic or just to read a book in the sun.||October 28, 2017

fenrisgirl||50||The park is lovely and relaxing to wander around. Even in the summer it never seems too full of people as its so huge. We like to pack a lunch and sit near the serpentine and watch the swans and ducks. It's a peaceful oasis from the busy streets of London.||October 28, 2017
LyndaS1046||50||We walked through Hyde Park from Paddington to the London Eye. What a lovely walk it was. Stopped off for coffee at the Serpentine and sat for ages watching the world pass by. A lovely place to chill in such a fast moving city. ||October 28, 2017
Chillyourbeans||50||A lovely place for a walk, even in Winter! We saw a surprising amount of wildlife and most of the birds aren't fussed about people, so you can get pretty close to them.||October 28, 2017
454dw||50||On a sunny autumnal day. Avoid the scones in the lido. A lovely walk around the serpentine. A very relaxing experience||October 28, 2017
081Tina||50||Amazing park with beautiful trees and flowers. You should come here for a relaxing walk and enjoy the nature itself. The air was fresh and it really doesn't feel like you're in London but somewhere outside the city! ||October 28, 2017
Veva L||50||As I have walked through this park on three separate visits, I am continually amazed at how relaxed I became in this serenely quiet spot of nature. ||October 27, 2017

renatakii||50||whether you are weekend visiting or a local you have to stroll around Hyde Park once in a whilw.if the day is sunny you should get a coffee or a tea,a book,walk around and then sit at the grass or the sun chairs and relax.if it’s rainy and cold,get your hot beverage and walk around admiring the peace and quiet of the area.rent a bicycle (if you don’t have one) or walk around. Go at the rose garden (specially during summer months) and have a coffee by the lake. Many statues around - favorite one Peter Pan!there is also the “speakers corner” which is located at the Marble Arch entrance if you are up for some debatable fun!have fun and ..don’t forget to collect your garbage!||October 27, 2017
frankp298||40||We had a walk in the park. It's a park with a lot of variety in plants and animals (roses, squirrels, parakeet etc). Trees looked awesome with collared leafs. You can run and walk as it has lots of pathways to walk||October 27, 2017
nir147852||50||London is a big city and you will walk alot.So the smart kingdom put up a big park for us so we can rest and have a bit of sun on our eyes and have a snack on a sunny afternoon.Dont miss a photo with the swans.||October 27, 2017

paul s||50||Having been to London many times previously and never taken the time to walk through the park, me and my girlfriend decided to take a stroll through today and just loved taking in the scenery and atmosphere. Walking through at any time of the year I'm sure would be lovely but we walked through this autumn and the park was just beautiful. A must do, there are cafes scattered around numerous spots and you can hire boats from what we saw. Take the time to take a stroll.||October 26, 2017
375arthurj||50||We stayed off the Bayswater Road and crossed the park each day seeing different events each time. Breakfast at the Lido is a must. Tea at the Orangery first class. ||October 26, 2017

evelinaNybro_Sweden||40||so central and still this peaceful quiet green park - just lovely to walk around, or take a rest on one of the several benches.||October 25, 2017
Rhonda R||50||Hyde Park was just steps across the street from our Hotel (Thistle Kensington). In order to get to the tour buses we would walk through Hyde Park. It was beautiful and for me, surreal. There were historical pieces everywhere you just had to know where to look. There was a tiny pet cemetery behind one of the old coach houses by one of the entrances but you couldn't see it unless you peeked through the fence. It was neat to see horses ridden through the park as they did in the past during hunting season or on a Sunday afternoon. The park is very large so things are always going on but there are many peaceful benches under big beautiful trees to sit on. ||October 25, 2017
Anilsahebraopatil||50||This park is so big that a visitor may not be able to visit and see it completely. We could visit only one corner of it where The Albert Memorial is situated. It is huge memorial with gilded statue and many other gilded articles. There is a very small but nice and cute coffee shop behind the memorial. Nice place for Selfie lovers !||October 25, 2017
Zoi-Maria||50||Its a massive and beautiful park! A must on for every Londoner on a sunny day. Google ''Peter Pan Statue'' and it will direct you to a location within Hyde Park. Buy some birds food or a fruit and head there to feed the beautiful parrots||October 25, 2017
IADP1||30||As an avid endurance ocean swimmer I needed to turn the arms over during our four week European vacation. The swim club people were super friendly, very helpful and I can't thank them enough for the opportunity to knock out a few kilometres in the water. Compared to Sydney harbour, the Serpentine is cold, uninviting and a bit icky, although the ducks seemed quite at home. Saying that, there are much worse bodies of water around, so give it a go if you are traveling and hanging out for a swim in London. It's something different to do!||October 24, 2017
ncwtj2000||50||Just great to run, walk, people watch or see events, concerts. Beautiful park with incredible flower displays. Bored? Try listening to the people at Speakers Corner talk about world events or any subject. Also nice lake in middle of park.||October 24, 2017
Stacia B||40||It is such a nice break to go from bustling London to Hyde Park. When I went I went to a coffee shop, sat outside and enjoyed the blowing leaves. There are so many great sections of the park that I just loved wandering around without a plan. The birds are lovely on the water. This place is well worth the visit. You can stay for 30 minutes or 3 hours. It really is a beautiful spot. Be ready for London weather though; be sure to dress appropriately.||October 24, 2017
kdma68||40||It is worth walking. The gardens and grounds are quite beautiful. There is a lot of wildlife at the lake . Very peaceful.||October 24, 2017

Ellen R||50||Oh the tales you could tell....Just take the time to do a short walk around Hyde Park. Go ahead, do it! You will not regret the time taken.Wonderful wide walkways, spectacular Sycamores, and a perfect people watching place....If you are missing your pups back home, as my husband and I were, go to the park. Watch dozens of playful pooches. If you have had a bad experience or heaven forbid, gotten sick while on vacation, go to the park for your pick-me-up venture out and about.Even when portions of the park are blocked from pedestrian traffic, due to construction, or what looked like “fibre-installation”, as this morning, Hyde Park is guaranteed to life your spirits. If you need to re-connect with nature, due to an aboundance of indoor activities, just go for a walk.If you promised your doctor that you would get some exercise, take a short walk.If you need to get away from your traveling companions, even for just a bit, go for a walk.Hyde Park never fails to touch you.||October 24, 2017
Jan P||50||From our hotel we strolled to & through Hyde Park on our last full day in London. Very beautiful & well maintained park. Lovely wildlife to watch, including parakeets.

finchiegirlf||40||I only had a couple hours in downtown London to explore and chose Hyde Park to rest in. There are plenty of benches along the paths. Plus I found a great outdoor coffee shop. It has statues for you to look at or just enjoy the green space. ||October 23, 2017
marlonr215||50||we strolled through the park on our way to kensington palace. Beautiful day and the pigeons and swans were all over. Very entertaining to watch. Well landscaped. and the lakes are beautiful||October 23, 2017
299geoffw||50||This is an amazingly great place, the park is so big, no matter how maney people are there you will find a quite spot, there are so many animals within the park, ducks, swans, birds of all sorts, squirrels everywhere, there is a horse riding track, so many paths to follow, there are plenty of places to rest and take in the peaceful surroundings, it also has kiosks in different places for a cool or warm drink and a bight to eat, Kensington palace is in there also, now that place is another story.||October 23, 2017
Meg_Redding||50||Whatever the season, if you visit London, a walk in the park must be on your agenda. It used to be what Londoners do. Walking along the paths, I am transported into the worlds of Virginia Woolf and the gardens she describes, the novels I read growing up, smelling the trees and the grasses, the flowers nod in the Breeze, autumn leaves scatters in my path, and always I fall in love with London again and again. How do we describe being English? Is it by birth or by an identification with the sense of history past, the greatness and the gentle ways of the English way of life (for some) captured for generations to come in a language accessible to more than half the world. Thank you, England and Hyde Park. With love.||October 23, 2017
bumblebellaroo||50||Go for a stroll in the park. Very nice. Highly recommended. Went to a cafe. Had sat by the lake. Got almost attacked by unique native birds from my pumpkin soup. They were after the bread! I soon learnt why no one else was outside. Great food though!!||October 23, 2017
332karenq||50||you cant miss it its a very nice place to walk around nice views and green areas to enjoy, there are coffee shops, restrooms and bikes to ride, also the lake has boats so you can have a lot of fun||October 23, 2017

loupowrie77||50||We went to London in a family trip with our 5 year and teenager and after 2 days I shopping, my husband was losing the will to live.Having left Harrods, we enjoyed a lovely walk through Hyde Park, past the Serpentine and up towards Marble Arch.The park has a great network of paths, looked like lovely bistro cafes and a place of calm for my husband.Loved it and well worth a visit.||October 22, 2017

Jencheltenham||50||The best park in London by far. Just beautiful for walking, running exploring and just finding that space for your self in the middle of London. Don't visit London and not give it a visit ||October 22, 2017
Raphael2016||50||Fantastic green space in the city. Kids loved the park. Feeding squirrels and parrots. Kensington Palace is at one end of the park and various monuments around the park.Lots of people walking, resting or just enjoying the beautiful grounds.A definite oasis in the hub of the city.||October 21, 2017

61mariaz||50||I fall in love with Hyde park. Green area in the middle of busy city. You can cycle, walk or run in this park. Well-developed infrastructure. It becomes crowdy at the weekend. I always buy some bird food in a local shop to feed enourmous amount of ducks, swans and pigeons. Once I spotted a floch of green parrots! ||October 21, 2017
JoseCarillo64||40||Enjoyable park with many facilities. However, overpriced lake activities. During winter winter wonderland is an amazing theme park ||October 21, 2017
darrencred||50||not to be confused with kensington gardens (lol, often on live outside broadcasts, hmm), the separation is by way of the serpentine (where they have a boxing day swim)...from near wellington arch (great statue), north to marble arch (loads of statues to see, and hotels that u look great at night)...up to marble arch (central line) and the primark for all the shoppers looking for bargains...then west to queensway...loads inside the park; sunrise is amazing at italian gardens.||October 21, 2017
Cheryl G||50||World known park in the centre of London - a cosmopolitan metropolis that is on the top of every list as a 'must go City'. Wonderful walks, gardens, boating, lakes, galleries, eatery's. It hosts the Albert Memorial, sitting in its own glory facing the Royal Albert Hall. You can horse-ride, watch the guards on their horses march by, avail yourself of the many seasonal events set up in the Park (Christmas and Winter Wonderland currently coming up). It runs alongside Park Lane: Bayswater Road: Kensington. A day out in its own right.||October 20, 2017

JPG815||50||Many facets to Hyde Park. One of the jewels of London. Cafe, boats, formal gardens - and SIZE! For me, the best of Hyde Park is that you can wander for quite a while and then find yourself alone in open spaces, grassland or trees, with no sight or sound of the London traffic. Magic. ||October 19, 2017
LeeMike||40||We took the tube to Marble Arch and then walked through Hyde Park to see Kensington Palace, Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, the Serpentine and all the birds frequenting the park.It was a beautiful day for a walk and we caught another tube at the south end of the park.||October 19, 2017
SharlotteC||50||Whilst on a weekend away we visited , the park was very clean , tidy and well kept all the way through you could buy drinks and snacks from various little stalls and ice cream , you can also hire a deck chair I think it was £1:50 an hour . ||October 19, 2017
506debw||50||Loads to discover through the park including the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain and walk.Highly recommended. Take a step back from the hussle of the city. Enjoy a bike ride, picnic or visit the wonderful cafe and children's playground.||October 18, 2017
BigHugh51||50||Our most recent visit to London saw us taking another long and enjoyable walk through Hyde Park.It was a Sunday afternoon and the park was full of Londoners out enjoying many forms of recreation in the lovely surrounds of this immense inner city park.Our walk took us past such well known features as Speaker's Corner, the Serpentine and the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain.Hyde Park is certainly a great asset for London. It is an ideal place to spend some time chilling out after indulging in a range of frantic and tiring tourist activities!||October 18, 2017
philips394||40||We walked through the south part of park from Green Park Station last Royal Albert Hall and Statue to Kensington Palace. It was about a 15-30 minute walk but nice and quiet even with all the people out of a great Saturday morning. ||October 18, 2017

M E||30||October was a bit late for the flowers but the park is still beautiful with multiple ponds full of water fowls and not crowded at all. We went there during the day and then at night. I certainly would not recommend any of their parks at night because of extremely low level of lighting. I didn’t feel unsafe at night other than it is impossible to see were you are going to. ||October 18, 2017
RiLoNoSo||50||Hyde Parl in nice weather, lots of people and wildlife, public toilets, open cafes, a relief and a place to take a stroll and relax.||October 18, 2017
Belgo96||40||Don't expect it to be as well kept as some of the other Royal Parks. Parts of it are not immaculatly planted and may seem a bit unkempt. It is however a large green space in an exceptionally busy area of London and provides a great retreat from the traffic. There are things to see in the park (Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, Speakers Corner) but it is also a place where large concerts take place. Multi purpose park.||October 18, 2017
bransopa||30||I only went into one side of the park. I expected it to be perfectly manicured like Central Park. It was not and in fact overgrown. It didn't look very well taken care of. Surprising!||October 17, 2017
DavidandAbigail||30||Hyde park offers a green space for Londoners who without it would be pretty much devoid of anything green until they strode over to Green Park. Its fairly pretty with lots of paths and clean and tidy but at the end of the day its just a rather average park||October 17, 2017
ARK70||50||Sunday morning and breakfast on a bench in Hyde Park. We also wanted to see the memorial place for Diana. But a half Marathon put a stop to the plans. We couldn't cross the road. But it was fun to observe all the people, both the runners and the public.I'll go back to Hyde Park!||October 17, 2017
TonyGeorge59||50||A wonderful expanse of trees, green grass, and things to discover. Give up on the shopping (you can do that anywhere) - go explore the park, watch the world go by, enjoy the rose garden, relax. ||October 17, 2017
notdoneroaming2016||40||We walked from Kensington gardens to and through part of Hyde park....it is a lovely walk which takes a bit if time....the squirrels are very tame and on a nice day, it is a good walk.||October 17, 2017

Johnny O||50||If you have not been into Hyde Park before, you have at least to get some few meters into it when visiting London. The park is big, but if you have plenty of time it's worth walking through it, as me and my family did some years ago, simply as the subway did have a one day strike. And it was really worth it. Relaxing! Of course there's nothing now like the first visit I had to the park in 1972, being a young teenager at 16, when the "speakers" were standing at theis butter or beer cases, speaking out to those who took time listening to them . Speakers Corner might not be what it once were, but Hyde Park is still the same huge oasis in the middle of Europe's most "busy" city. Therefore I also this year had to bring my family there, to simply enjoy the surroundings!||October 16, 2017
Nese Y||40||Takes about half an hour to cross the park vertically. Peacefull, maps all around, perfect for a day in the city but in nature as well. ||October 16, 2017
dr_iggy||50||So much going on in this large park, which is something of a refuge from the hectic city. Horses, statues, lakes, gardens fountains - or you can just wander its many paths, forget the hubbub around you and enjoy the peace.||October 15, 2017
Iteach4fun||50||Highly recommend staying in a neighborhood close to Hyde Park if possible. Easy walking paths, family friendly and well marked. Beautiful sights to see within the park, you'll never get bored. Historical monuments, memorials, and a palace at one end! Don't forget the famous Serpentine lake and children's garden/ play area. I lived within walking distance of Hyde Park years ago and every time I'm back in London it's a must for me! ||October 15, 2017

Plenty places to sit and take in the views of London in the distance. Boating available on the Serpentine with cafes and Serpentine Gallery too. The gardens also nic, peaceful with a variety of lovely plants and walk through them on the side nearest Kensington||October 14, 2017
Brian V||30||It is nice to cut through the gardens and have a seat for a few minutes. We rested our tired feet and watch the swans and ducks in the pond. A welcome break before getting back out on the city streets of London ||October 14, 2017
926spencerb||50||You have to go to this park not just for the beauty of the park when there is nothing going on there. just to see the beauty and the wonder of the park. But been to winter wonderland this is a must you have to go to this spectacular event. Also if there is a band there it's a must to go. But just for the park it's self the history the outstanding beauty.||October 14, 2017
ishusangh||50||Hyde Park is a major park in Central London. It is the largest of four Royal Parks. The park was established by Henry VIII in 1536 when he took the land from Westminster Abbey and used it as a hunting ground. It opened to the public in the early 17th century and quickly became popular, particularly for May Day parades. It is home to a number of famous landmarks including the Speakers' Corner. Free speech and demonstrations have been a key feature of Hyde Park since the 19th century. Speaker's Corner has been established as a point of free speech and debate. The Hyde parks is full of interesting statues and unique monuments. The Cavalry Memorial, Diana, Princess of Wales memorial, Holocaust Memorial and the 7 July Memorial are the most famous ones. The Park has a famous “great entrance”, which was constructed to give more powerful view to the Park. The entrance consists of a screen of handsome fluted Ionic columns, with three carriage entrance archways. The park also offers various activities like open water swimming, boating, cycling, tennis and horse riding.||October 13, 2017

youngpapaya||40||London is much greener than most visitors realise when they arrive. Hyde Park is a nice size and is surrounded by a number of important places to visit. Speakers corner is a Sunday afternoon feature,Harrods is a short walk south of the park,you connect with Kensington Gardens on the west side ;and on the east side you have Park Lane with its different car showrooms and super traditional hotels like the Dorchester and the Grosvenor. The Playboy Club was once sited here and it is the gateway to Mayfair.Hyde Park itself is a great place to stroll in and on a fine day to sit on the grass and feel happy!||October 12, 2017
SheilaTA||40||As I was near Paddington Station, I've crossed the park two days to go to Buckingham palace, and other day to go to the museums. It's a very nice park, and at time was plenty of people enjoying the sunny days.||October 12, 2017

Krystof||50||We stayed near Hyde Park when we were attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. We walked through the park in the early evening on the way to the concert. We walked through it again, in a different direction, the following morning on our way to Hyde Park Corner tube station. We were very luck with the weather and both walks were enchanting. There are beautiful ponds with fountains, amazing monuments, the Serpentine, people feeding the wild parakeets and deckchairs for hire.||October 12, 2017

hs8733||40||I ran around Hyde Park to Kensington Gardens and back every day while I was in London.Though it was cold in the mornings, with some light rain but I just love love love the atmosphere. The horse droppings need to be avoided, as with that of the swan/ geese by the pond. Its big and lovely. No untoward incidents to a hijabi runner running solo in there. Very safe in the mornings (7 am onwards)||October 10, 2017
Sandra M||40||We walked through a portion of Hyde Park. We walked through the Diana Memorial garden & then through a section of the park. Such beauty in a big city!||October 10, 2017
underthebluesky92||50||One step into the park and the noisy and hustling of city is gone. Joggers, bikers, walkers, horse back riding all in a I can't believe I'm in the city setting. The smaller gardens and fountains are lush with flowers and sounds of water. Ducks, swans and small birds abound helping you feel more of nature. Trees were just starting to turn, reds, oranges, yellows and burgundies, leaves on the ground smells like autumn. Worth the walking, worth the time and effort to get there. ||October 10, 2017
bluelizard||40||We enjoyed a pleasant and relaxing stroll through Kensington Gardens, along the Serpentine and into Hyde Park. It was a mild autumn day, mid week so not very busy, which was a bonus. We saw a parakeet (hubby thought he was going bonkers) just down from the Norwegian War Memorial and again near the Serpentine Bar and Kitchen. The area we covered was well maintained with beautiful flowers in some areas, and the autumn colours were just beginning to show. There are toilets at the Lido cafe.||October 10, 2017
Kimmybear2013||40||I work near Hyde Park and use it regular. Many say it's boring but a park is what you make of it. It has speaker's corner which is interesting.

TravellersGoldCoast||50||We were fortunate enough to experience Hyde Park at the end of summer - on a gloriously hot day. We hired bicycles and cycled around the park - along the designated tracks, around the serpentine.Highly recommend Hyde Park for some "time-out" if you're travel or city weary. There are deck chairs for hire around the park, but it's just as easy to take at rug and sit on the grass.||October 7, 2017
miss_ella_stevens||50||And absolute must do location for a Christmas visit to London. The Winter Wonderland event is the best xmas event in the world, it's absolutely outstanding.

Kathy L||50||Hyde Park is big and beautiful, with many smallish sections that are each uniquely landscaped. We walked the edge of the park on our way between Royal Albert Hall and Apsley House. It was a great walk, and we especially enjoyed the rose garden. Although we were there in late September, there were still lovely roses everywhere.||October 7, 2017

More than enough to occupy adults and children for many hours. Best to take a good map!||October 7, 2017
sharont413||50||This is the most beautiful, relaxing park.....you can job, paddle boat, sightsee, or just watch the duck and squirrels....The other end of the park has Kennington Palace , the Princess Di memorial is in the middle.

pr0write||30||This park is huge! It meanders through a busy part of London, with open meadows and tree-lined paths and a body of water smack dab in the middle of it where you can paddle-boat or lie in deck chairs. Sports teams gather to play soccer or frizby. It's always full of people. Not a very tranquil park but a good one for cycling and walking.||October 5, 2017

Neha Agarwal H||50||A huggggggggggggeeeeeeeee Greeeeeeeeeeeen Patch around the Buckingham Palace. When on the Golden Tours Hop on Hop off bus, we were informed that Hyde Park is often referred to as the Lungs of London... Its just lush green all around, everywhere.... When you get out of the Tower Bridge Underground station and walk towards the Buckingham Palace, all you see is greenery all around you... absolutely neat, well maintained and lush green all around you... It is also supposed to be one of largest (out of the 4) Royal Parks. It stretches way too long and forms a necklace that passes from the entrance of Kensington Palace through Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, via Hyde Park Corner and Green Park past the main entrance to Buckingham Palace. Whenever we passed the park from whichever corner, we saw beautiful sights of parents spending time with their kids, joggers running along the footpath, couples having a conversation, working professionals taking their conversation to a more relaxed environment in the park... It was just beautiful.||October 5, 2017
abdo55||40||this well known park at the end of Oxford street after passing the Marble Arch monument and the Speakers corner you have a long walking passages surrounded by flower trees and greeneries ending to a wide lake with ducks and swans which also has paddling boats renting facilities . It is very good to have walks ,or jogging or cycling and spending healthy breaks from the city streets . you can see people from different parts of the world and hear so many languages from people of different age . But make sure to choose a sunny day to have the most of it but its wise to carry an umbrella because LONDON`S WEATHER IS UNPREDECTABLE||October 4, 2017

It was a welcome time to unwind from the more daunting attractions of the city while still taking in some very nice aesthetics and appreciating the park's history. Also fun to take a stroll down Rotten Road; most of the people I grew up with probably assumed I would end up on a path like that some day.||October 4, 2017
Suzie O||40||We took some food from the CoOp ...salads etc and some prosecco. We walked then the park, watched the squirrels, ducks and swans and had a great lunch, great to get away from the hustle and bustle of London||October 4, 2017
DaniFarrar||50||There is so much to do ion Hyde Park it's great. You can just spend a day relaxing, taking a run or attending an event. It's very local to many eateries and a short walk to Buckingham Palace.||October 3, 2017
entirelyamelia||50||Hyde Park is a beautiful bit of green within London. I went for nice 10k run through the park and enjoyed the lake and the birds.||October 3, 2017
Gretchen M||50||Lots to see and do in the park. Beautiful fountains, nice walking paths, places to eat, sit and ponder. They have paddle boats, horses, feed the ducks, wander through a historical area of London!||October 3, 2017
briancK3368JL||50||On our visit to London this year we attended the BST Hyde Park concert and saw Tom Petty. May he Rest In Peace. The concert and venue were something to see. Absolutely first class all the way. Tom Petty and Stevie Nicks. It couldn't get any better than those two. Hit after hit after hit. The park itself is incredible and the area for the concert was perfect. Lots of bathrooms, places to eat, places to drink and the crowd was very civilized. The only negative was to do with my camera. My lens was apparently too long to bring onto the grounds. When I told them I travelled about 6000 miles for the concert they allowed me disassemble my camera and put it in my knapsack......boy was I p.o'd. I took it to Wimbledon and had no problem so I thought I could take it here. I probably should have read the small print a bit closer because I'm sure there is something there about lens size somewhere. Anyway...all in all a great experience and I got to see the great Tom Petty before he passed away. My wife and I are early 60's and found it a little difficult to stand for too many hours or sit on the ground. It would have been nice to have an area at the back of the venue where you could perhaps rent a chair to sit and listen to the music and have a drink||October 3, 2017
Mrssusanclifford||50||2nd year for a concert in the park really enjoyed the events ideal for concerts. Also very nice to walk around the park and explore||October 3, 2017
8SAB8||50||You can literally spend hours walking around the park and you feel that you lost track of time. Being in the heart of the city yet feeling so remote from all the congestion and traffic is a blessing. There are lots of walkways, benches and cafes for a quick bite. Beware though there are some seatings which incur a fare! The peddling boat for the lake is an enjoyable experience and can also serve as a good family bonding experience.||October 3, 2017
ellina520||30||Its a nice park but not as nice as Regents Park. If you have time you can take a walk to both and see for yourself. ||October 3, 2017
880salims||50||What could be a better experience than visiting Hyde Park on a nice summer day. Its simply the best park in the world with attractions and activities for everyone||October 3, 2017
867jodib||50||This is such an amazing park! Feed the ducks and swans, find a playground for the kids, bring a picnic lunch or grab something to eat from one of the vendors, but definitely bring a blanket and chill. The gardens are well maintained, people are quite friendly. Also a great place to take a jog or have the kids bring their scooters.||October 3, 2017
MrG43046||20||The park is very large but I was disappointed with the care of the grounds and fountains. We went out of our way to walk the park...wast of time.||October 3, 2017
Azachi||50||We were there on sunday morning and the place is amazing. we walked inside for about 1 hour and all over are hidden jems nice views. ||October 2, 2017
590yolandas||50||It is autumn but the weather was still perfect for a stroll in the park. You could see chipmunks and ducks ... and just people everywhere relaxing in the beautiful green surroundings. It is a place that is just good for the soul.||October 2, 2017
449lesleym||50||If you're in London make sure to go to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.A beautiful peaceful oasis in the heart of a very busy, crowded city. It's huge and has many lovely paths to stroll along. Lots of flowers and birds, including majestic swans swimming on the Serpentine River. A tranquil place to walk, jog, ride a bike or sit on a bench and rest and relax. It's very clean and well maintained.My favourite spot is the Italian Water Gardens. There's a nice little cafe nearby.||October 2, 2017
T A||40||Great place to spend an afternoon. Pet friendly. One of the quietest parks in London. Doesn't even feel like you are in the city. Sundays are the best.||October 2, 2017
Mary D||50||Great place to walk rotten row and round the serpentine and though tKensington garden also Buckingham palace great time to spent a day ||October 2, 2017
Marc R||50||Wonderful park with many paths to follow. Not too busy and very peaceful. Plan at least a half day to full day there to see it all. Bicycles are available for rent too. Beautiful lake with overlooking restruant.||October 2, 2017
Luigi S||40||If it isn't raining worth buying food from a nearby food shop or your hotel and stroll along the park. Can enjoy cycling, rowing or simply walking from Marble Arch to Kensighton.||October 2, 2017
jollyaussi||50||Hyde Park is huge and is frequented by so many tourists. It is really well looked after and is normally clean. I would avoid on sundays as there are too many people who express their views at speakers corner.||October 2, 2017
cris a||50||london landmark. one of london best park. not to be missed. take a stroll and relax. many things to see/do||October 2, 2017
harindersingh1979||50||One of the nicer parks to visit in London. I spent a few hours just wandering around looking at the beautiful sights!||October 2, 2017
Divadolly||50||Went to Hyde Park one day to see bands playing and it's a fabulous place for an outdoor event. Huge open space, even on a busy Summer day you could still find a quiet spot, lovely to walk round as well||October 2, 2017
mansmanreality||50||If you skate, blade or are a wheelchair user then this is the place for a trip.The footpaths and walkways are swept and tidy so anyone on wheels will find it good.The park is big enough for the masses of people and you can still always find quiet spots.I understand that not all London parks can achieve the quality that Hyde Park can fund through tourists but it is a real quality standard to aspire to....||October 2, 2017
Iceshark||40||Nice park as we walked back from Victoria and Albert Museum.Cool Windy October day alone the lake. Too many people feeding pigeons and squirrels. Restaurant at the southern end of the lake is a great spot to stop for a pint.||October 2, 2017
playabonita||50||We attended the massive concert for Last Night of the Proms at Hyde Park. It was a huge event and the park handled it very well. There were plenty of bathrooms that were as clean as can be expected, many food vendors, and lots of security. A tip for tourists is to bring a cheap tarp with you to sit on, then toss it or give it to a homeless person afterward. Even as a non-Brit, we thoroughly enjoyed the show!||October 2, 2017
annanB5997WJ||50||This place is just perfect for chill out, walk, run, meeting with friends, picnic, sunbath..anything really. It is clean, nice park with lake where you can spend whole day!||October 1, 2017
fedjablpula||40||You can spend a whole day here. It is very big and it was a pleasure experiencing how people live in large town like London and still have a corner like this in their city centre. There is a lake where you can drive some cayaks ,there is a lot of animals and much other things to do.||October 1, 2017
LilMsTravels||40||This is a wonderful place of walking, running/jogging, horse riding and cycling (except where there are restrictions). A very tranquil park, with a variety of things in it, including the memorial garden and fountains in the memory of Princess Diana, and some walkways that lead to the Albert Memorial and the Royal Albert Hall, as well as galleries, Kensington Palace and an ornate area at Lancaster Gate.. Hyde Park is suitable for all the family and a great place to take your dog for a walk...||October 1, 2017
GNF8419||50||Amazing park - and it has the Kensington Palace in it and also a memorial for Princess Diana with the most beautiful flowers ever. So, it is worth visiting, for sure. ||October 1, 2017
612jgreene||40||We come from SF and have the luxury of Golden Gate Park in our backyard so we love to wander and relax in city parks. This summer it was raining pretty good in London and the park was deserted so we decided to explore. It was so peaceful and the rain through the trees was awesome. Granted this park is not as beautiful as something like Luxembourg Gardens, but it is certainly an oasis in busy London. ||October 1, 2017
DeannaM669||50||The parks are a soothing respite in the heart of a bustling city. Strolling through them is refreshing. Each has its own charm. Huge and centrally located, Hyde Park is one of London's best-loved parks with tons of trees, a lake, a meadow and rose gardens. Royal St James's Park is surrounded by three Royal palaces. Spanning about 58 acres the park has a lake which is home to its famous pelicans. You can watch them being fed at 2.30pm. It also boasts Horse Guards Parade and the Mall – the setting for countless ceremonial parades – and the stylish Inn The Park cafe. Kensington Park is a beautiful Royal Park in Central London, home to Kensington Palace, the Albert Memorial, the Peter Pan Statue, beautiful flowers, green grass for picnics, and the Diana, Princess of Wales memorial garden commissioned by her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.||October 1, 2017
Leanne R||50||We took a cab to see the Princess Diana Memorial and when leaving, happened to be invited to take a tour of the park oh a cart driven wagon, for £5. Our guide was very nice and took us on a special tour since we were the only people on the tour. She showed us the magic birch tree, and pointed out the important things, like where Prince William and Kate's garden is at Kensington Palace, the fact that accommodations are in the works for a prince Harry, and the beautiful garden that William and Harry had built for their mother. The Prince Albert memorial was magnificent, as was the garden Prince Albert has built for his wife, Queen Victoria. We wouldn't have seen any of these things on our own, so we're very pleased with the tour and can highly recommend it.||October 1, 2017
Sallylonglegs||40||A pleasant stroll in the autumn sunshine. The park is very well cared for and maintained. We enjoyed the thought that royalty would have ridden through these parks all those years ago.||October 1, 2017
AZCoachJ||50||We used Hyde Park as a relaxing walk to ease out of 10 hour plane flight. The park is beautiful. The statues through out the park were amazing. The Princess Diana Fountain was unique. For a park in the heart of a major city, we never felt our safety may be compromised. We were never approached by beggars nor did we see homeless sleeping in the Park. ||September 30, 2017
929farham||40||This is the ideal place for a break from a shopping trip to the city, Oxford Street and Knightsbridge are around the periphery. The park is also ideal for a picnic around the Serpentine Lake, or for a jog within city limits. Thoroughly enjoyable.||September 29, 2017
lemoncoke07||50||lovely place for a stroll. even better during autumn i presume with all the beautiful colors. on a Sunday it is packed with runners and families strolling... a perfect place when it isn't too cold for a nice little walk.||September 29, 2017
jodie_amanda||50||My husband and I spent some time walking around Hyde Park as we were staying in nearby Bayswater. The park is absolutely beautiful with clear signage and with great information, such as that showing the location of where Crystal Palace once stood. ||September 28, 2017
lizaprivosnik||50||Lovely park, with sooo many hidden places. Good place to hangout w/ friend, have a picnics or just walk around. It's like "central park" in London☺️||September 28, 2017
tomj932||50||This is a really big park great for a daytime walk to get away from the busy streets for a bit. There's a little cafe with outside seating where you can get a hot drink or snack. Worth a visit if you are after a nice walk||September 27, 2017
TexasPuma||40||A very large park. We strolled through for several hours. Quiet and peaceful. There are several monuments and gardens. Paddle boat rentals. Several geese and ducks on the ponds.||September 26, 2017
Isa-Francis||50||This is obviously the largest park in London, especially if combined with the adjoining Kensington Gardens.Entering at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station enables you to walk a bit in the park before hitting the Serpentine water pond. You can then walk alongside it all the way to the North to see the Italian Water Gardens, which are very nice. From there, you can walk your way into Kensington Gardens all the way to the Kensington Palace, which you can visit.Then, you can head South East to see the beautiful Albert Memorial and adjacent Royal Albert Hall. The close-by and recent Princess Diana Memorial Fountain is quite a disappointment... but the horse-clay area next to it is quite impressive and gives nice views of the London Eye and the Shard.Expect to spend anywhere between 1 to 3 hours in this park, depending on the pace at which you walk in it, the route you follow and if you elect to eat in or not (a picnic is a good option on a sunny day).||September 26, 2017
BigMo_28||50||The first thing we did upon arriving in London was visit here. We hiked from the Hilton on the north west edge of the park across the Kensington gardens, Long Pool, by the education centre (LookOut) to the Hyde park bandstand (ca 1.7 miles) in the southeast corner taking pictures. After reading TA, I was quite concerned about pickpockets and such so I got one of those moneybelts. The clip on the cheap thing fell off somewhere along the way with my license credit cards cash. We were pretty despondent heading back to the hotel to cancel everything all of an hour into the trip. Got to the hotel front desk to get another room key and an angel from the education centre named Emma found it and tracked my hotel down through the room key. She hoofed it all the way over to the coffee shop by Long Pool to meet me to return the belt intact. Instantly turning a disastrous start of my first trip to Europe into a great experience learning what kind of people actually make up this fine city. I was in such disbelief that I really couldn't thank her enough.||September 26, 2017
Chris P||40||We walked there to visit Kensington Palace but took a few minutes to walk around and enjoy the park. My wife took several pictures of the swans. They are magnificent birds. If I lived in London, I'd want to spend a lot of time there.||September 26, 2017
LorynL||50||went to the BST festival in Hyde Park was a brilliant venue great sound plenty of toilets lovely food stands no queue for the bar. very well organised||September 26, 2017
10Orchard||40||this area of the park is natural and the round pond emerges out of the parkland. kensington palace looked worth a visit but we went onto the Diana gates themselves. worth a quick look||September 26, 2017
augustoabati||50||Great place to go for a morning run, or even a stroll. Can get a bit busy on sunny and warm days. A few monuments around the park worth taking a look. ||September 25, 2017
JillofToronto||40||Hyde Park is big and pretty. But it's a park... Kensington Palace is a nice marker and cool to see, but otherwise it is not particularly striking. They will charge you if you sit in the chairs, just fyi!||September 25, 2017

jennyandmanda||50||Had a fabulous time in this Royal Park , must sees are the magnificent Albert memorial and the Diana fountain , walk down to Kensington Palace and along the serpentine where you can take a boat out , kiosk for drinks a bit pricey £2 for a can of coke , but still this is a great park and if you fancy stop off and go to the museum just by the royal Albert hall||September 24, 2017

JennCherngS||50||We stay in the hotel nearby the Hyde Park and we often walked through the park in different time.It is not only big but very well maintained and beautiful park. You can easily access to Harrods department store, Victoria and Albert museum and other museums too in short walking distance.Will be a big miss if not visit Hyde Park when visiting London||September 23, 2017

Akram304||40||Hyde Park is such a beautifully laid out park with lots of activity on Serpentine Lake, Serpentine Gallery and lots of areas for children and adult's to and enjoy||September 22, 2017
ellen06804||50||Walked all the way through this park today from one end to the other. Spent a little time sitting on a quiet bench in the rose garden and that was lovely. Watched the people paddling the little boats on the lake and would like to do that sometime. Saw the many birds flocking about and begging for food. One man actually had some beautiful green canaries coming to eat out of his hand. Most of the other birds were pigeons and geese. Peaceful fountain dedicated to Diana is on far end as one walks toward Kensington Palace. One really nice thing is that there are chairs set up and scattered all around the park for people to sit in.||September 22, 2017
alejandroz292||50||I love to come here to walk when I am in London. It is one of the best parks I have seen in any city. ||September 22, 2017
jennieg119||50||Don't miss a visit to Hyde park! Lots to see and do. It's a big park so we hired a bike at one end and cycled round. You can pay £2 for 24 hour access then the first 30 minutes of every ride is free. If you get the bike docked within 30 minutes it's free and then you can just release another bike. This gives you plenty of time to cycle to see the park and see everything plus have little breaks and photostops. Great place and must in good weather!||September 22, 2017
roberta L||50||My husband and I love London. We choose to stay in areas around the park. From Sunday's speakers corner to a simple stroll this park is so rich in history. The Italian Gardens are lovely, as you step into Italy. The fountains are beautiful.. Just sit and you are transported to Italy. If you stay around the park, a morning walk or run is a must. The park is for the people and is London!!||September 22, 2017
Amer H||30||great location over looking Hyde Park lake. extremely busy so sadly cleanliness and attentiveness is do not exist. The food quality is better than expected bearing in mind they are catering for tourists||September 22, 2017

Rajiv L||40||we were staying just on the corner of Hyde park. If the weather is good one would really like to strol around and see the lake, wood area and also look at some of Londons sky line from there.||September 22, 2017
HeKtor89||50||Huge park where you can bike, walk, row a boat. There are so many options and activities. The park is huge like central park big maybe even bigger. I would recommend a bike because its that big. ||September 21, 2017
nickandangels||40||Hyde Park is one of the many green lungs of London providing an oasis from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street! The park has fabulous green open spaces, the water of the Serpentine, cafes, art at the Serpentine galleries, statues and monuments, water gardens and wildlife! Something for everyone! The largest of the Royal Parks has existed in this location in some shape or form since 1536 when Henry VIII took the land from Westminster Abbey to use as a hunting ground. The park first opened to the public in 1637, so it's had a few years to mature into the fantastic park we see today!The park provides a great walk between Oxford Street and Kensington! ||September 21, 2017
giovannaberl||40||Whenever we come to London we visit Hyde Park it is so beautiful and relaxing we love walking around and looking at the birds and the sunset.||September 21, 2017

It has many activities such riding bicycles, horses and rowing boats.It has also many foundations, roses garden, memorials.Even if you just went for a walk you will find the ducks, doves and squirrels all along the ways.It is the nature itself.||September 20, 2017
Vincy L||50||Beautiful place with lots of swans, ducks, geese lounging around. Many people taking walks and strolling through the park. ||September 20, 2017
jmig2016||40||This park is huge - so if you think that there's only lawns think again!I went there a few times, first mostly to see Speakers Corner, but it was such a nice and 'cozy' or relaxing park.If you go further you'll find the Peter Pan Statue and Lady Diana Memorial Fountain.I would 100% say that this park is worth a visit (it's at the end of Oxford Street)||September 20, 2017
NorthChicagoCouple||40||Was caught in traffic with taxi, hopped out to cut through the park quickly. Stunningly curated landscapes in high garden style, beautifully tended. A great place to get lost, "London's Central Park" offers well maintained paths, art installations/shows, and superb people watching. Quiet natural beauty beneath towering oaks and chestnuts. The Oak Grove installation is compelling, the Italian fountains and chair rental area a lovely place to sit and enjoy the moment. Horses and riders, and pedestrians only, no cycles.||September 20, 2017
JiffChan||50||Need to spend some time in the morning before other attractions open, it is a very large park with plenty of plants and grass for you to have a freshly breath, rent a bike for cycling or even with your lovely pets/ children.You can see the squirrels, ducks in the park and the overall atmosphere is very relaxing||September 20, 2017
809StevenC||50||When the weather is nice it's an amazing place to relax but when it's cold ur open to the elements and u need to pop in to the coffee shop to get a bit of heat back in to the body. A good place to feed the ducks ||September 19, 2017
manfred1177||50||for a different day and something different and not only shopping every day, try rent a bicycle and ride in this very large park and you will experience a difference London.||September 19, 2017

25leahm||50||Hyde park is a great place to take kids of all ages for loads of fun! We paid £32 for an hour peddle-boating for one adult and four children which was so much fun and well worth it! The kids really enjoyed steering and taking turns to peddle the boat. They also really enjoyed the play area, seeing the Princess Diana memorial and walking in the gardens. All in all, it's a great place for a fun day out in London!! ||September 18, 2017
polyksena||50||Beautiful park with many interesting points such as the Rose Gardens, the Serpentine lake and Speakers Corner. Surrounded by two other parks - Kensington Gardens and Green Park, so you actually find yourself from one park into another.||September 18, 2017
lovetheunexpected||50||Had a very enjoyable walk entering the park at exhibition road where there are gardens & play areas, then along the eastern side of the Serpentine, stopping for a coffee at the little Lido cafe. Not sure what to make of the Princess Diana memorial fountain, a bit underwhelming is probably how best to describe it. Deckchairs can be hired to sit & watch, and boats can be hired. Took me about 90 minutes to stroll along half of the serpentine & out of the park at Hyde Park corner, with the coffee stop.Also free & very clean toilets are available next to the Lido.||September 18, 2017
Bill C||50||By the time our vacation was over, my wife and I considered Hyde Park to be our home base. We went to it nearly every day while we were there, wandering through the gardens, sitting by the Serpentine, visiting various attractions in the Park, including the grounds around Kensington Palace. The park is huge, but very well kept and clean. There always seems to be something going on during the weekends. There was a concert there, and some kind of swimming marathon on the two weekends we visited. On weekday evenings, it is quieter, but never so quiet as to feel deserted. If you're hungry, there are a few cafes scattered throughout it. There are also free toilets in places like the west bank of the Serpentine. It is very friendly to people out for a stroll, with many paths banning cycling. Overall, definitely one of the best places to visit in London.||September 18, 2017
billybob101||50||A great escape from the hustle and bustle from the city, we really enjoyed our walk through this park. Our journey through the park was actually part of a recommended walking route proposed by one of our guide books. The route took us through the Italian gardens, buy the Princess Diana memorial playground, etc.... We stopped to rent those paddle boats and really got a good leg workout. We had ice cream next to the boat rental place and continued on our way. A nice break.||September 18, 2017
benidorm88||40||You can walk for hours in this park as it is so big, we walked the length of the Serpentine and found Diana's Memorial. My wife was over the moon as she had forgotten it was there. ||September 18, 2017
bigredk9||50||This park is magnificent. It's gigantic and in the city so it's perfect for long walks or jogging. There are also fantastic monuments inside the park. I recommend it for a peaceful stroll or somewhere to have a picnic. ||September 18, 2017
sid_2001||40||hyde park has something for everybody- for the young and old alike. beautiful oak and maple trees, a pleasant stroll can be enjoyed along the water of the lake and can see several ducks.||September 18, 2017
ZorTso||50||Got lucky with the weather and enjoyed a 2-hour walk through the rose garden - exploring the variety of rose scents, enjoying the concert of robins and thrushes, then played around with the silver-tailed grey squirrels that seemed to be all over the plays. They were absolutely fearless and not ashamed to climb up your leg to beg for food. ||September 18, 2017
bahrainreview||50||Visiting Hyde park is almost our daily routine while we are in London. Such a wonderful place. If only we had a quarter of this park back home in Bahrain! If you have kids, then you have 2 play area options: Hyde Park playground, and on the other side of the park, Diana memorial playground in kensington gardens.||September 18, 2017
K254CFtimp||50||I have been too and passed Hyde park many times but this time actually took time to look around and was amazed by it. It's huge and so much to see from the Italian gardens, Lady Di's memorial and the amazing Albert memorial (which is with a visit on its own). So much other stuff over such a large area, it was great to see so many people taking advantage of a fantastic 'free' park.||September 18, 2017
Vasiliki P||50||One big green heart in the center of london so much of good and clean air you much have a walk to this big park on sunday||September 18, 2017
MikeN660||40||I walked through the park to visit the Diana Memorial and Kensington Palace on her 20th Anniversary. Beautiful and Moving.||September 17, 2017
TahoegpSA||40||Although, we had not realized the vast size Hyde Park and the associated Kensington Gardens, we enjoyed our afternoon in the park. Definitely be certain to wear comfortable walking shoes / tennis shoes. Sights to see include statues, fountains, carousels, the lakes/ponds, wild parakeets, and special sights like the Diana Memorial Fountain and the Peter Pan statue. Take the time to download or pick up a map to avoid backtracking and wasting your energy. There are snack stands and kiosks in the park or you can bring your own picnic. Depending on your time factors, you can also tour Kensington Palace while in the neighborhood. ||September 17, 2017
SeattleCyclingMom||50||Hyde park is beautiful but my favorite "attraction" in the park happens on Sundays at Speakers Corner. Loved watching and engaging in the dialogue that was going on. Many topics, provocative ideas, and most of the time respectful debate.||September 17, 2017
travellerkha||50||I used to work in London sometime ago and it was great place to rest in lunch time. Green grass and just a simple bench to sit -that is all you need there. There is also Kensington Palace if you need more entertainment ;) also food is available.||September 17, 2017
Theodoti||50||We went for a lovely walk in this park. Although there is lots of construction going on at the moment it was still a very relaxing experience.||September 17, 2017
leanndooley||50||We walked over 5 miles through the park. It was the blessing of the horses so we saw beautiful animals. This is a beautiful area and so maintained||September 17, 2017
Arif K||50||A great place to walk, run, play football in the middle of one of the busiest areas of London. It is a treat for the Londoners. Would recommend anyone to have a long time and enjoy the serenity of the place.||September 17, 2017
AleksHuddersfield||50||So much to see and do in Hyde Park. Start by the wonderful Italian Gardens and walk down towards the Serpentine gallery taking time to feed the tame parakeets that live here freely. Check out the birds and fish on and in the lake. Marvel at the great variety of ancient trees on your way down to the Albert memorial opposite the Albert Hall. Then cut back across to the Diana fountain and stop for a drink or snack at the pavilion on the lake edge by the lido. So much to see.||September 17, 2017
BarryandKrisH||40||We had an 8 hr layover in London so we took the Heathrow Express to Paddington and walked to Hyde Park. We did 20,000 steps of walking this day....Paddington Station through Hyde Park to Buckingham Palace. Great day. Park was awesome and we stopped for lunch at the lakehouse. Traffic was backed up going through the park so would be annoying for anyone in a car but we were walking through the park so we were fine. Great place to people watch. Chairs available for rental if you wish to sit a while. :-)||September 16, 2017
sparky221||40||I did not expect all the cross-walks and paths cutting through the park. We entered at Speaker's Corner and tried to find Kensington Palace but was easy to get turned around with all the paths.||September 16, 2017
lis_o_j||50||Everyone needs space and nature - so this is a treat in the middle of busy London. Walking through the park is such a delight.||September 16, 2017
rowenap671||50||This has to be one of my favourite places to visit in London. Not only for people watching, but just because it is such a relaxing way to get out of the hustle bustle of the city! Relax on a bench, take a casual stroll around the many pathways, visit Alberts Memorial, Kensington Palace or just enjoy the ponds, ducks and the grass! In summer you can see people sun baking; and in the depths of winter, this park can turn into a winter wonderland. A perfect place for kids to just run around or a family picnic. Or when lucky enough to get snow, to build a snowman or snow angels!!! Trust me, either way, some time here should be included on your agenda! ||September 16, 2017
802ak||50||This park is truly a gem within London. A great place to run. Safe. Also a good way to cut across the city while getting some exercise. Plenty of swans, pigeons, ducks and other attractions. Strongly recommend to take the time and visit the gardens - well maintained. A must if you visit London ||September 15, 2017
WorldCT||50||I loved this park and the whole area. You can surely enjoy the walk in the park and there are small kiosk for coffee or drinks and the area as whole is nice and close to the famous Harrods Department store, less then 10 minutes ||September 15, 2017
NailaR_12||50||We went to Hyde Park specifically to have a quiet walk with our toddler, who was very sleepy, and to eventually have her play in the Princess Diana memorial fountain and park. The walk was very pleasant on a sunny but slightly chilly afternoon. We enjoyed the fabulous scenery and greenery as well as the ducks, swans and other birds in the pond.The Princess Diana memorial path, park and fountain is a great place to take babies, toddlers and children. On a Sunday afternoon it was quite busy but still spacious and clean.We then decided to rent a paddle boat and take our little one out on the pond to enjoy seeing and feeding the ducks and swans. It was so much fun for all of us, we have some great memories and pictures from that short amount of time. I am so glad we did that! At 12 pounds for an hour it was a great deal. You can also buy duck food for a few pounds as well.Hyde Park is a great place for a walk, for pictures and for spending some time with the kids away from the hustle and bustle of the city and it's many busy attractions. There are clean public bathrooms that will cost 20p to use but they are very worth the price as they are well kept. The baby changing area and disabled washrooms are free which is nice so that those that need those facilities don't have to wait with everyone else. I recommend making time for Hyde Park during a sight seeing trip to London.||September 15, 2017
xkittyhiggins||50||Great walk but not for those who don't like walking as it is far from small! Looks beautiful no matter what time of year you visit! ||September 15, 2017
KenFromIllinois||30||Good exercise to walk around the lake, people watching. There really isn't a lot to see or do - you can rent a paddle boat or other floating device for exercise. Don't take a toddler who is into ghosts as there are lots of Muslims in full burqas. I could see my grandson hollering "there is a black ghost." This was really unexpected in London.||September 14, 2017
Anna M||50||This park is like an oasis. There are so many beautiful spots to sit and relax and it is so green and beautiful! ||September 14, 2017
aditya_ravikumar||40||Huge park , easy to reach and in the heart of the city. Lot of walking trails and cycling paths , or you could simply rest on the green grass or rent a chair and relax. There is also a boating service in the lake and a few pubs with the lake facing view ( last order 1930hours )Overall a nice outdoor area in the city to pass time before you head for dinner. PS - expect you be walking at least 2-3km so have a good footwear ||September 14, 2017
Wylie18||40||Huge open parkland areas, dotted with beautiful gardens, a large lake and plenty of shaded areas to sit and relax. Relaxing way to spend a few hours away from the crowds of London.||September 13, 2017
Karen H||50||Lovely park for a stroll with nice gardens . You can tell it is well maintained .The serpentine bar and kitchen in a great place for breakfast . ||September 13, 2017
Jazzlove15||50||I love this place and all the time I have the opportunity I try to walk in and go around with friends family or my husband. Worth a visit for sure, I love the lake with the ducks and swans and visiting the Peter Pan sculpture ||September 13, 2017
macstan1||50||We had a great time, everyone very friendly weather could have been better, but lucky enough we wet completely kitted out with the right type of clothing. ||September 13, 2017
K666RLB||40||With it being a lovely sunny day the family and I decided to make the visit. It's a great open space in the centre of a busy city. Despite it have high visitors the place was very clean and tidy.Can't imagine it's much cop however in the rain!!!||September 13, 2017
Bernadette R||50||lovely place to go great quiet stroll clean area many interesting monuments etc to look at when walking aroung child friendly||September 13, 2017
NjTravelBugg||50||This was my third time in Hyde Park and I was happy to experience some new sights from my previous visits. We set out from Kensington after a hot drink at an outdoor cafe, beginning with a walk past Kensington Palace (no tour availability that morning as they were already completely booked). The gardens were beautiful with lots of photo-friendly spots. Next, the lake with all of the ducks and swans...fun to see the different species that you don't see in the US. We continued our walk towards the Peter Pan statue and Marble Arch, but on the way we stopped to see several people standing off the path a bit under some sort of apple tree...they were holding up the apples and feeding these wild green parrots (such fun if you don't mind getting a little sticky from the apples and maybe a little scratched up from the birds). That was definitely a highlight of our walk, as those unexpected surprises often are.||September 13, 2017
Tihomir T||40||The park is really big. It's very beautiful with its green areas, lakes, birds and opportunities it gives for different activities. There are several sights to be visited. ||September 13, 2017
karenZ9651FP||50||Excellant time, great evening. Toilets was reasonably clean although a lack of water but antibacterial handbasin was provided. well organised.||September 13, 2017
stephanie504||50||Lovely green space with lots to do . Lakes river Diana memorial fountain . Coffee shops . Italian gardens etc||September 13, 2017
lpeacock1||50||I've spend a lot of time just walking the park and looking at wildlife and flora. I usually go first thing in the morning. Have seen the horse guard horses being exercised across the bridge in the middle of the park... what a sight. There are many water fowl active at this time. The flower beds during the spring and summer are inspiring. ||September 13, 2017
MIADangerous||50||...in the best city in the world - but I'm biased. A really large park which has almost everything one expects from a park and is close to everything (aside from the Old City of London proper, if you know the difference). Its a large park, approx 6km around the perimeter. It takes 30 mins to walk east to west and 15 mins from north to south.The underground Central line runs along the north perimeter and the Piccadilly line in the south east corner (imaginatively named Hyde Park corner), where there is also a major bus route hub. I particular like visiting Kensington Palace, the Albert Hall, then walking down to the Science Museum and back to Hyde park corner on Brompton Road via Harrods. If you wish you can walk from the Parliament buildings to Notting Hill almost all through parks, the others being St James Park and Green Park. There are concerts in the east of Hyde Park, next to Park Lane which run virtually every day in summer until mid September, almost every kind of music there is. The venue holds approx 60, 000 people, I would recommend just going and see anything just for the experience. One thing I don't do personally is pay for food and drink in the park because I don't think it is good quality and the prices are unreasonably high, If you only visit once every few years then one might choose to swallow the cost given the fantastic location, but there are many, many good places to eat and drink close to the park at a fraction of the cost.- well as long as you don't go to a place on the roads immediately adjacent to the park -use the Tripadvisor map||September 13, 2017
richardcI9593JM||50||On a sunny day in the heart of London, this should not be missed! Tranquil, relaxing and away from the hustle & bustle. And like many great British institutions, it's free to all!||September 13, 2017
Richard B||50||Lovely, blissful, joyous...these are just a few words to describe this magnificent green space in one of the greatest city's on earth. My tip, my tip is this, rent a bike, cycle round. Go round the serpentine (big pond) and just relish the beauty of the place. Also do visit the Serpentine galleries. There are two. Always some great exhibits on. Perhaps also get a coffee and a piece of cake at the Lido cafe. Honest to goodness. If you can't like Hyde Park you can't like life.||September 13, 2017
Jessica D||50||Beautiful park for a walk. It is a quite place in London. It was so refreshing,very clean .Recommended for anyone who wants to escape the hustle and bustle of London for a while. We were so happy to be there while we were in London.||September 12, 2017
vladoram||50||Huge park. You need plenty of time to go through it. The lake and the swans are stunning. You can get food at the coffee shops. The fountains are beautiful.||September 12, 2017
rutrut112||40||I have to echo some of the other comments regarding the sound quality, this was not up to the usual standard you would expect. Some acts sounded they were singing out of the bottom of a bucket. It seems to be the norm that there is never enough ladies toilets as my wife went missing for ages queuing up.The facilities were pretty good though although it was £27 for a bottle of wine...Shame about the good old british weather but we had a good time and the organisation to keep us all safe can be commended especially at the end when all visitors were given clear instructions regarding local transport etc.||September 12, 2017
TPlongy||50||First time at this event. Doors opened at 3pm, started at 5.15pm. We expected queues, but we turned up at 5.30, security was stringent, but about 20 separate places go through so no queues whatsoever, bags searched thoroughly and politely (re-assuring).Organised perfectly. I can agree with previous comments - an outdoor event without disgusting toilets - no there's a thing! Toilets were in containers of 6, with sinks with hot and cold water and hand towels - not a queue in sight, no mud and no stinks - bliss!The entire event had food and drink stalls around the entire circumference, you name it, they had it, italian, moroccan, waffles, pancakes, vegetarian, pizza, goes on and on. Bars were either general, real ale, G&T, champagne bars, all brilliantly organised.People able to take in chairs and rugs, own food, own booze (limit of 1ltr per person but no glass bottles obviously), or you could pre-order a hamper. Some people looked like they were coming for the week with so much food.Atmosphere was carnival, loads of families, wonderful.Sound was amazing, little paths inbetween the green bits so you can find your way about... massive screens up so even though we were miles away from the stage we could hear and see well.Definitely recommend going, worth every single penny, would be great for families too.Walking up through the actual park itself, past the Serpentine, with deck chairs all along the sides, bar and restaurant, was a shame we didn't have time to stop, very very pretty.||September 12, 2017
Ilian0736||50||A peaceful place, so close to the center. Just went there for a walk, i discovered a palace, lakes, many statues and beautiful trees. Really great to have a break after visiting the city.||September 12, 2017
DinahGO||40||Whenever I visit Hyde Park I am reminded of how lucky Londoners are to have this glorious place within their city.There is just so much to enjoy whatever your age or the weather. I love how well used & loved it is with many locals using its vastness to maintain fitness -running, cycling, even Nordic walking using skateboards!Go, enjoy||September 11, 2017
SDTwit||40||Spent as much of my visit here as I could. It is a maze of walking paths, vast lawns (meadows?), enormous trees, and water features. Bicycles are allowed on some of the paths, but there did not seem to be much danger of being overrun. If you are afraid of dogs, this may be an experience to avoid. Many dogs were running free, and there always seemed to be one nearby. It added to my enjoyment. There are also statues and memorials, as well as fairly casual eating establishments. There were a nice variety of birds, particularly along the waterways. — There is a lack of signage at most pathway intersections. This made it difficult to navigate around the remains of a concert from the previous day. A large section of the park had been separated into a secure concert venue with high temporary walls. Without good signage you could wind up coming out somewhere you didn’t intend. A gps app may be a good choice here.||September 11, 2017
Kateluvsfood||50||Thankyou radio 2 !! Fabulous day out , great artists (apart from Blondie) , great event and facilities and crowd. A memory made !! If it rains next year please pull acts in closer together ... if the sun is shining nobody cares . So well organised just a great albeit soggy day ||September 11, 2017
JayBloomfield||50||Congratulations to the organisers and the Met Police for such an organised event. Te BBC Prom's in the park was amazing.But what was even better was the organisation of crowd control by the security and police. There was no queuing to get in as there were more than enough staff to search. one of the few events i've been to that had plenty of clean toilets nd when the event finished thousands of people quietly and quickly were guided out of the area. If only football matches were this organised||September 11, 2017
neil838||30||It was a disappointment for two main reasons. First, the sound quality was a joke with the level of bass drums and bass guitars drowning out the other instruments and the actual vocals. Second, too many acts with too little set time. The breaks between acts were almost as long as each acts set. It;s been 15 years since the great Shania Twain has appeared on stage in the UK, and she was given just 30 minutes. Absolutely ridiculous!||September 11, 2017
86frankiet||50||Well organised gig with something for everyone.The acts this year included Blondie, Take That, James Blunt, Stereophonics, Emile Sande, Wildwood Kin, Seth Lakeman and Rik Astley.Great value at £49.A wet later afternoon but nobody can do anything about that.Hyde Park is very easy to get to and get away from which makes it an excellent venue for an outdoor gig.||September 11, 2017
Anthony S||50||Perfect place for a walk through and to enjoy a beautiful and well kept public place. Many statues and large open grassy areas suitable for everyone not to mention the lakes and their foreshores.Check for closures at this time of year due to large events.||September 11, 2017
CoreneBloemfontein||40||Hyde Park is – for me – synonymous of Londoners drinking up the sun and walking their dogs. The gardens are well kept. There are plenty of places to sit and relax. ||September 11, 2017
Monsieur-Vinzz||30||Here the squirrells are not afraid of you. The Only problem is when You try to feed them, a tenth of pigeons run After you. Same thing with the gooses, they chaise You.The park is Big and Well taken care of.London has many many parks||September 10, 2017
WWorker||40||We walked around for a short time and then found two "sling" type lounge chairs which were vacant. After sitting in them for a short while, an individual came up and requested payment for using the chairs. We were surprised and disappointed that the sign for "rental" of the chairs was back from the large lake. I am sure they make a nice profit off of unsuspecting tourists. The benches were free.||September 10, 2017
LesleyDavies34||50||This park is so lovely. There's lots to do and see. It's so well maintained. Lovely areas to sit and have a picnic. Boats on the lake. Wildlife. Great for walks. My latest visit was for BBC proms in the park - which was great. ||September 10, 2017
Pilar1978||50||Visited in June and really enjoyed wandering around - there are many entrances and crossing the park to get from one part of London to another really beats taking a cab! Highly recommended.||September 10, 2017
KellyGibbins81||50||Went to Hyde Park for the BBC proms in the park event in September. Walked from Hyde park corner which is about a ten minute walk to the concert entrance. Was allowed to bring in alcohol and glass wine bottles which was a bonus as you usually can not bring that into other events but as this was a chilled out family event it was perfect. The atmosphere was brilliant and everyone just pitched up with there chairs and picnics and had a great time. The toilets were nice and clean and the onsite food was nice too. It is well worth a visit to this beautiful park and going to this event is brilliant for a taste of the British atmosphere. ||September 10, 2017
Chris500||40||The grounds are immaculate and it's quiet. A good place to meditate or sit and feed the birds. Hyde Park is London's most prestigious address.||September 10, 2017

Meriwell||50||One of my favourite places for a run or stroll is around the Serpentine Lake... beautiful. It's really large so 2 or 3 laps around a good run. Nearest tube to Serpentine is Knightsbridge. ||September 9, 2017
Perry B||50||Hyde Park was as delightful as ever recently. It was a perfect place to roam around in and explore. The cool leafy greenness even in the height of the English summer was soothing and restful. The multiple paths and walks were all special and chock full of delights.||September 9, 2017
Powergi||50||Perfect Park to have a walk in the center of the City, place is quite and well cared, it worth a visit||September 9, 2017
Denise B||50||You can easily spend an entire day at Hyde Park. Kensington Palace on one side, a lake, a flower garden, a beautiful water fountain to honour Princess Diana and wide open grassy spaces. Ride a bike, run, walk or just sit and watch the world roll by. Bring a picnic or pick up a bite at the park. Beautiful parkland with lots of interesting attractions.||September 9, 2017

JosepG642||50||Hyde Park is the biggest park I have ever seen and it is so quiet that you do not even realize that it is in the middle of the city! It is a pleasure to stroll along its paths and stretch to rest on its lawn. Its extension is amazing. He has a lovely lake with ducks and swans. There are many squirrels and birds everywhere. Everything is very clean and well kept.Very well connected.||September 9, 2017
VicKy_6655||50||A huge park!! Green spaces and beautiful flowers. There are also points in memory of Princess Diana and the Jews murdered in the Holocaust. Don't miaa the lake and the swans. Wonderful!||September 9, 2017
faris_001||40||A good walk and some fresh air. You can also rent a bike there and go around .there's a big lake in tge middle another option is to rent a small boat. ||September 9, 2017
rayrest||50||The ancient manor of Hyde was part of the lands of Westminster Abbey which were seized by Henry VIII in 1536. James I opened the park to the public in the early 17th century and soon became fashionable. Now it is a highly priced area of London beyond most of our pockets. This large park is an excellent area to walk in London and at weekends many come to enjoy the laid back atmosphere. ||September 9, 2017
JimW551||50||What a great park to go for a nice run or long walk! There are always events going on and it is a great place to people watch! Nice to go and sit and relax. To come to London and not walk in Hyde Park would be a shame!||September 8, 2017
HalaBoo||50||I loved this park. It's huge, the view is fascinating. A great way to detox. Make sure you visit the restaurant on the other side of the lake. ||September 8, 2017
MIchalR9543IW||50||I love this place, so quiet, peaceful, lovely. Many things to do. Plenty of space where to go and what to see in area nearby. ||September 8, 2017
Mark J||50||This is a massive yet intimate park located in some of the finest areas of London. Stretching from Kensington Palace to Marble Arch there is something for everyone. Quiet, contemplative benches to wide avenues where bikers and walkers are everywhere. You can rent "rowboats" and enjoy the large lake or just take in the scenery. For the U10 crowd there's the Princess Diana play area and for walkers there are many, many miles of paths to choose from. From Prince Albert to Speakers Corner there's is a place to take a quick or long break from your routine. Be be sure and plan in advance as the park is truly large. Enjoy.||September 8, 2017
foolfortravel77||40||We just sat in the park for a half hour on a really nice evening in London. We had bought a couple items from Harrods and enjoyed them in the park.||September 8, 2017

deborahlroberts||40||after staying at the Cumberland hotel on the Saturday and going shopping it was a great contrast on the Sunday to walk in Hyde park and go boating on the lake. I'd thoroughly recommend a weekend break like this. when you are boating you'd never believe the heart of London is within walking distance. ||September 8, 2017
mandspur||50||Amazing open space to relax in and have a beautiful walk in all weather.Lots to see around the park , lovely cafe near the Diana memorial and beautiful gallery with free admission.You wouldn't think you were in central London so peaceful .||September 7, 2017

ReviewerToronto||40||Lots of activities are available in the Park including boating, jogging, cycling, walking and horseback riding. There are many areas to relax on benches or the grass..Lots of birds frequent the park and swans and ducks can be found in the lake. A stroll through the park is a nice break both for tourists and locals alike. We would recommend taking time out to enjoy nature. ||September 7, 2017

raelene61||50||This park is a beautiful tranquil setting in the middle of bustling London. It is lovely to be able to casually walk around the grounds and enjoy nature. A great place to unwind from a busy day of sightseeing||September 6, 2017
Tasia15||50||After a day of shopping we strolled through this park and found it relaxing. Options to buy snacks, ice cream and drinks were available in a variety of spots and it was nice to see quite a few people enjoying the afternoon sunshine. There was also a concert on the other side of the park so it may be worth you looking up any events happening when your visiting.||September 6, 2017
Ritu_Pisces||40||I was in London for the first time a few days back and wanted to make a trip to Hyde Park and its Speaker's Corner because of all the references in Wodehouse books, which I used to love. I was only here for a few hours (it's a pretty huge space) and saw only a fraction of the park and the Speaker's corner, which I wanted to. The trees were beautiful ! If you enjoy nature, I would recommend spending some more time here. Tip: The Speaker's Corner is NOT clearly marked. It is the area around a refreshment/snack hut and only after going around for a bit, we found the sign (The board itself was huge, but the mention of speaker's corner was tiny). If you love nature, or if you want to take a break from hectic London, or if you love Wodehouse, I would recommend this park. We walked here from Buckingham Palace (where we saw the changing of the guards in the morning), so both these can be clubbed together. ||September 6, 2017
Chris P||50||Fantastic nice walk and let your hair down a lot to do and see just keep on walking the princess foundation water falls was great to see on a warm day with children and adults slashing about.||September 6, 2017

Richy R||50||Entered by Hyde Park Corner, walked along 'Rotten Row' until the Rose Garden - peace and quiet! Continued north side of 'The Serpentine' to The Sackler Gallery (Grayson Perry was exhibiting). Crossed Serpentine Bridge, around to the Lido Cafe, then back to starting point.Two hours well spent!||September 6, 2017
Liz R||50||This park is massive and historic. The hunting ground of Henry VII turned into a park with fountains, lakes, ponds, gardens and monuments. Pack a picnic and spend a few hours or stop at one of the many coffee stands for a snack.||September 6, 2017
tassiestourers||50||A lovely park with cultivated and wilder areas. Things to do..hire boats, restaurant, bar..but lovely walking. A nice break from the bustle||September 6, 2017

Nannyannie69||50||If you are wondering around London it can be tiring, this park is a lovely rest from the crowds. There is a place to have food and drink or ice cream. You can watch the ducks on the Serpentine and just chill before you get busy again. ||September 6, 2017
Privish83||50||This is a really wonderful place and I really liked the scenic beauty over here. The big green park is the main attraction over here. Also you can enjoy a beautiful lake over here. I would like to visit here again.||September 6, 2017
Pete W||40||we chose to stay near Hyde park. Found this place . it was great value for the cost you got a clean room with friendly staff||September 5, 2017
06hta||50||Life in london moves at a very fast pace, and Hyde Park is the perfect "pause" button. From simple picnics to rowing a boat on the serpentine while enjoying the sound of the ducks, Hyde Park makes it all the more difficult to look forward to heaven. ||September 5, 2017
nouraaliramahi||50||Hyde park never gets boring no matter how many times we visit. The endless spaces of green and trees is a perfect place to spend a sunny London day. Great place for a picnic or a jog or just a lazy stroll. The kids loves watching the swans and ducks and feeding the fearless squirrels. ||September 5, 2017
TravelWanderlust90||50||Located in central London, Hyde Park is the most popular as well the biggest in the bustling capital. There is a beautiful lakes with many swans, side grasses to chill on, a small main road to cycle, coffee shops and ice cream stalls. This is a real park everyone can enjoy themselves||September 5, 2017
RedSkittle||50||Huge park so dedicate lots of time. Obviously check the weather ahead of time. Can really make or break the visit. ||September 5, 2017
jl2travel||40||Hyde Park is so near to many London sights, including KensingtonPlace and Gardens. Large enough for anyone and everything, bikers, walkers, picnics, street performers and a lake with Royalswan. We strolled over to the pake after purchasing our take away food from Harrods food court. A real delightful afternoon.||September 5, 2017
bonmom707||50||Wild bird sanctuary within manicured lawns and gardens. Do not miss a walk around the whole of the Serpentine Lake, and do not miss the moving waters of the fountain for Princess Diana. The Italian Gardan is also lovely. Rent a paddle boat and then get a local brew at the top end of the lake. Great for walks, birding, photography, runs, and picnics. Bring some crumbled bread for the birds and squirrels, but take care to feed them only in allowed areas (well-marked).||September 5, 2017
Timothy R||50||Emerging lately and designed so carefully, it appears seemingly to have been in the park forever, this Lodge is a great place to grab a light bite, and when the roof is available see all the bird life and wildlife. I needed something light, so I feasted on a lovely Ceaser Salad with Apple juice but I saw a lot more things on the menu that need trying on my next visit. The distressed woodwork suits the environment and the ultra modern interior gives you confidence that it's clean and well run. In an age of occasional building badly and in the wrong place, even I think this was very well thought out ! Recommended for food and particularly location.||September 5, 2017
RobReno||40||We got off bus near west end and walked to east end. It's Big, with a lot of open space. You can rent paddle boats in large pond. A large section was fenced off for an event, which made our walk even longer to get around the closed area.||September 5, 2017
Architecture12||50||When in London I always come to Hyde Park. It always has different things to offer. it changes through the seasons and so do the activities held in it. ||September 5, 2017

myprettie||50||Huge park which can take you half a day to finish. Children ran around and enjoyed the spring breeze. It was a beautiful sunny day. For us who live in Singapore a humid tropical city. It was a rare and wonderful experience. ||September 4, 2017
RiColl||50||A lovely place to whle away a few hours away from the bustle of the busy streets of London. Hard to believe that you are actually walking in a very old park with ancient trees and in the centre of London.||September 4, 2017
mammamia656||50||Full of joy, this place is peaceful and bustling at the same time. A real haven.on a sunny day we walked and walked, with something interesting around every corner.||September 3, 2017

profharrywaters||50||As I had spent the night in Victoria and had an entire day to waste before heading off to my next hotel I decided to take a very long stroll across town. The highlight of this was a 2 hour walk in and around Hyde Park. It's an absolute.must do. Especially if you have kids or you're trying to waste away a few hours without having to sell a kidney for the privilege of 20 minutes in a Costa Coffee. Amazing park. ||September 3, 2017
kebav||50||Spent a few hours walking round this park. Absolutely lovely on a warm / hot day. Plenty of people watching opportunities as they skate and whizz around. Lovely cafe too to have a cuppa. Princess Diana memorial fountain is here. Just lovely walking around it||September 3, 2017

khalidAlshami||50||Hyde Park one of the finest parks in UK.Beautiful lakes, trees and green spaces. On any beautiful day it is impossible not to enjoy it.I doubt anyone visiting London not going to this place being next to the shopping area, other landmarks in the hart of London.The park is a great choice for fun with your children, they will enjoy every moment, make sure you take a football with you.||September 2, 2017
Myddle||50||London is a big city. A busy city. There is always something to do, which makes the appeal of this mark all the more attractive as it is a lovely place to stroll through, lie down in, picnic in and generally relax. ||September 2, 2017
Fosseboy||50||We have walked before from Hyde Park Corner all around the lake and stopped at the lido for coffee. Watched baby ducks and swans, squirrels and nature. This time we did the North side from Bayswater Road. More natural. Walked to Speakers Corner.On a sunny day this park is great. An oasis of peace. And free.||September 2, 2017

SarahI487||50||Whether it's a stroll in the park you're after or a great place for a picnic or a place to go boating in the city- this place has it all.||September 2, 2017
Steve S||40||A great urban park to wander around or sit in the grounds and watch life going by.We had a few days in London and our Hotel was an opposite Hyder Park and so it was easy and convenient to go for a stroll around the park||September 2, 2017
Alison23lufbra||40||Great to have big parks in cities and this royal park is no exception . Great for walking , cycling , swimming, boating , sunbathing in a deck chair (pay by the hour) or eating drinking in several cafes/restaurants . Lots of wildlife and home to special events such as proms in the park and winter wonderland . ||September 1, 2017
GrassValleyMe||40||We were there on the hottest bank holiday since 1965. Many people were out, but the Diana Memorial gardens were uncrowded and lovely. We decided to get out on the lake; lines for a row-boat were shorter than for pedalos, and my partner is a good oarsman. There were a lot of people on the lake - some noisy foreigners - but we were able to keep well clear on this big lake. Ice cream was a bit of a rip-off. But this is a lovely, huge park and many people enjoyed the grassy, treed expanses.||September 1, 2017
Matteozk16||40||This is a very nice park to walk through with a nice cup of coffee and see all of the flowers and see the ponds. Would not be very high on my must see list though||September 1, 2017
Sallyjaq||40||Walked through here to get to the museum's. Lovely stroll.. Had lunch at the lido cafe. Was a bit expensive but not too bad for central London. Enjoyed just sitting looking over the lake. Lots of things to do for children...||August 31, 2017
kazouk||50||Hyde Park is large, have many dimensions. Well maintained and loved by a variety of people and generation. I particularly like the side of Kensington palace side. ||August 31, 2017
bccrab||50||I've visited many times but on a recent Sunday the weather was so fine I decided to walk the entre park. It was a great exercise and very interesting and entertaining to spend several hours wandering around in this really beautiful green space in Central London. Highly recommend a visit.||August 31, 2017
JoMarie357||50||Wonderful wide open space. Cafe's, horse riding, formal gardens, flower beds, and plenty of water features. Unusual quirky photo ops all over - like lodge cottages and a Rolls Royce Ice Cream Van! Deckchairs for hire but some public seating around. ||August 31, 2017
BeanyExplorer||50||What a beautiful park (although not the best in London that goes to Richmond Park). We enjoyed a lovely walk along the Serpentine and Rotten Row, through the flower gardens to Kensington. The Park was heaving with people and flower displays were looking wonderful. This Park is worth a visit st any time of the year. ||August 30, 2017
miller3224||50||One of our favorite places we visited was Hyde Park. We wandered for hours in the park. It's adjacent to Kensington Palace, where Diana lived and the grounds are adjacent to Hyde Park. It wAs really neat to see Diana's White Garden. The Royals visited it just several days after we did!||August 30, 2017
lperrin973||40||Enjoyed our walk through the park. It was safe. Enjoyed seeing the Italian garden. There was no mess . ||August 30, 2017
amyleighc||50||A brilliant place for a walk or to relax. We visited on bank holiday when the weather was 31 degrees C. There's chairs you can rent out for around £1.50 an hour. Stunning park. ||August 30, 2017
hootie j||50||You can't visit this city without a stroll around the park. There are so many different things to do from hiring a deck chair to eating at one of several restarant/ cafe bars, to stopping at a converted Rolls Royce vehicle that sells ice cream. On Sundays, on the Bayswater side, artists display their paintings by fixing them to the railings. The park has a children's play area to keep the younger members of the family happy and entertained.||August 30, 2017
Darcust||50||The park is really big - a huge green oasis in the middle of London. the trees seem to block away a lot of the noise of the city.They have a great play area for kids - sand galore!||August 30, 2017
June E||40||We visited Hyde Park as we were walking through London. It is such an iconic park and a must see. It was nice to see so many people out enjoying the day. There were many pick up futball games happening and families just enjoying the outdoors.||August 30, 2017
CansunDemir||50||Hyde park is in the middle of the city. Is is very lovely if the weather is good you can sit on the grass. There are cafes and other facilities. You can see many animals and there are many pools with lillies as well.||August 30, 2017
Travelalot724||50||Love to just walk around in this park. I walk around the lake and practice people watching. If you want to hear something you may not heard before, head up to people's corner!||August 30, 2017
easterntreker||40||Got off the tube near Marble Arch . A lovely place if you want to chill out and take a break from the city. It's a London landmark nit to be missed.||August 30, 2017
Greeners43||50||Such a lovely place! We planned to just walk through the park but ended up spending a couple of hours here on a hot sunny August day. The Serpentine lake is fabulous and great for relaxing beside.||August 30, 2017
allaboutchopi||50||I've visited it many many times and always is like the first time. The lake is really beautiful, if you want you can also take a paddle boat and cruise around it.Hyde park is always very clean and full of cute squirrels that you can easily watch climbing trees and approaching tourists looking for food.Together, St James's park and Hyde park are the green lungs of London, always there if you want to take a walk.||August 30, 2017
dorisdazzlers||50||After a walk around Oxford street it was nice to take some time out from the hustle n bustle. Enjoyed a little family picnic in the park whilst watching the world go by. Deckchairs to rent we're reasonably priced for an hours relaxation. Beautiful scenery and a great place to take time out!||August 29, 2017
lenchrj||40||This is a great place to have a look around and have your lunch. Probably needs a few more free seats for the older people to sit on through out the park. Very well maintained gardens and flower beds. ||August 29, 2017
flyfisher66||40||This is one of the best parks in London that has something for every age group; nice walkway & garden, play areas, few specialist play areas, a lake, restaurant, a rose garden and even a corner where you can say what you want to say. It is quite big and has multiple entrances so keep a track from where you are entering and from where you intend to exit. I was specially interested in the rose garden but there wern't many roses blooming in May. The collection in the rose garden was nice though. If you want to fully enjoy this park, have minimum 3-4 hours at you disposal.||August 29, 2017
andoffigoagain||40||After an exhausting shopping trip to Selfridge & Co....it was a real warm day and lots of people walked or biked or played frisbee or were just sunbathing in some of the rental chairs the park system provides or one can bring themselves...we had time before heading back to the hotel so we crossed a huge part of the park before heading back out to find an Underground station...lovely way to get away from the buildings and the noise of a huge city ||August 29, 2017
graememattinson||50||Spent the afternoon here in the lovely westher. Ad a good wlk through the busy park then the Kids splashed about in the fountins, played with balls then went to the serpentine for a drink. Great time had by all. ||August 29, 2017
Adventurers049||50||This is a very large and wonderful park in the middle of London.There is so much to see and do in it.||August 29, 2017
714rachnak||50||Hyde park is a great place to chill out when the weather is fabulous. It fills up with people taking advantage of the good weather. Grab a few bits to eat and drink from the local supermarkets along oxford street / edgeware road and have a lovely day in the park. Be a bit street smart with your personal goods, but otherwise safe. The Winter Wonderland during Christmas is overpriced but great fun and the carousels and the serpentine lovely places to walk to and walk around. If you fancy a big walk, go see the Peter Pan statue. If you are a runner, it's a beautiful space to take a jog or find a local outdoor bootcamp. A great place to chill out in London. ||August 29, 2017
Tatev B||50||I suggest to walk by this park, it is very beautiful, wide, there is nice lake, fresh air. if the weather is good, you can also swim in the lake.||August 29, 2017
R0hanL||40||We walked the length of this park and stopped along many of its sites as well. Our kids could run around and play amongst the trees to their hearts content. Furthermore, it was great seeing so many people enjoying the opportunity to be in the glorious sunshine with their families and friends.||August 29, 2017
Jayantpai||50||Walked through it on the way to Kensington Palace...and lolled on the grass after our visit, just watching kids play and birds fly around, soaking in the serene atmosphere. ||August 29, 2017
KNICKRD||50||We stopped and had a picnic on the lawn near Sir Albert memorialIt was so clean, quiet.Others were around us enjoying the day, but everyone was so well manored. No music blasting. Beautiful sunny dayWe saw dogs running around and kids playing but oddly still peaceful||August 29, 2017
Moonbeam59||40||We hired pushbikes and rode through Hyde Park on Sunday and all around families were enjoying the summer sunshine. A very easy ride and the paths are great.Just a note - you do have to pay to go to the loo... lol||August 29, 2017
jaball||50||Great Day walking around the park and seeing the Diane Memorial. Nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.||August 28, 2017
chefwizardnz||50||It's wonderful, large, uncrowded and beautiful. Need I say more. Take plenty of time. You can also connect to Kensington Gardens if you have the time. It takes about an hour to walk the length of.||August 28, 2017
jude965||50||One could spend all of their time in this park. Kensington gardens is spectacular and we loved to walk through the park to get anywhere!||August 28, 2017
scottgillanders||50||Just get lost wandering around the serpentine lake and enjoy all of the beauty this park offers. Birding is especially fun. Watch the swans and geese for hours. ||August 28, 2017
ColoradomanDenver||50||stayed a few blocks from Hyde Park on a recent visit. Ran around the park every morning and it was lovely. Great paths, lots of runners and bike riders and horses. Felt like about a 5 mile run around the perimeter. Beautiful interior lakes and gardens||August 28, 2017
cryosync||50||Very beautiful, relaxing park. I hope they will keep this place clean and beautiful.Ideal for cycling. And faboulous lake tour around. ||August 28, 2017

KMR139||40||What a great place to go on a warm day. Entering at Queensway and walking down to Kensington Palace at one end then through the main park trying not to get run over by the people having fun on their bike's.The way some were dressed made me think I'd arrived at the beach (not complaining).It's a perfect place for children to run round while you have a pleasant stroll.||August 28, 2017
rogerp539||40||the boating is a must, an hour is good value for money. remember to buy duck food from them as bread (and milky bars! yes i saw someone trying to feed swans milky bars....) causes a lot of problems in th birds and water quality.||August 28, 2017
bladebiker||50||What a delight Hyde Park continues to be. Only regret was apparent lack of respect by some at the Diana memorial fountain. This should be a place for quiet reflection, it is not a water-park (could benefit from better supervision). Otherwise, GREAT visitor attraction all round.||August 27, 2017
Fatface1977||50||We spent the whole day in the park,there is so much to do there, pedal boats, rowing boats, plenty of refreshment sites, deckchairs and just grass to sit on. We went on the Santander bikes, there are plenty of bike routes through the park, but also peaceful areas where they are not allowed to go. Walked and cycled miles!||August 27, 2017
avik r||50||The Hyde park is the most soothing and fantastic place at the heart of London which is full of lush green nature. Every visitor enjoys the time with a breeze of fresh air and sunshine. Very good place for a jog or cycling which will lead you to the serene view of the Serpentine lake. May God keep this place just as it is forever...||August 27, 2017
vaccarile||50||Hyde Park is and remains one of the best parks in the world.I recommend a stroll through the rose garden but do not limit yourself to it. The Serpentine lake is something to see and if you have time get a sail on the pedalos. The Speakers Corner is not only an English Speaking spot and will give you a good idea on what is in the mind of people. It is also a tribute to a multi cultural society and the right to free-speech.An experience that cannot be missed||August 27, 2017
Stumpy12345||50||We went here to sit in the nice grounds and relax.There are certain cycling areas, plenty of toilets and refreshment areas, lots of benches and lots of grassy areas.Totally relaxing and peaceful ||August 27, 2017
Vazbo||40||Hyde Park is the place to come to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon. It has it all - Serpentine Lake, Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, Speakers Corner, Peter Pan statue, walking/cycling/jogging lanes and plenty of grass. You can go boating on the lake and hire pedaloes. There's cafes dotted about the park too. Nothing nicer than a stroll through this park especially when the sun is shining. ||August 27, 2017
Ruchi890||40||A very huge and very nicely maintained ,neat and clean park. Actually it's not just a park,is very big and spread over huge part of central London. It has many gates and you can access it very easily from all parts of central London.special kids areas are made inside equipped with swings etc. Small coffee outlets are also there in various locations. The Buckingham palace is also nearby ||August 27, 2017
gregorysT9901XT||50||Went for a walk this morning around the whole of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens: about 6km and 90mn at a leisurely pace. Quiet place despite being surrounded by busy roads. Trees provided some nice shade for a very sunny morning. On the South side of the park, we took the path between the horse track and the road for cars to avoid being on the path shared by cyclists and pedestrians (between the horse track and the lake) to avoid the cyclists who can go quite fast and some joggers who go straight at you. Good that the park is modifying the path on the East side to make cyclists go a bit slower. Also nice new coffee places around the park (near Lancaster gate, near Albert Hall and near Palace gate). ||August 27, 2017
Bayzid S||40||You can have boat ride and feed the duck. or you can rent a bike and ride around this beautiful park. It is also very nice for a walk or just relaxing!||August 27, 2017

444danielp||20||Maybe it is just being from Minnesota, but Hyde park was nothing special and we all kind of wished we didn't waste the 90 minute walk through the park. The park was too busy the lake was man made and full of paddle boats. I guess I prefer my parks to be all natural. Have a picnic at St. James park and skip Hyde park.||August 26, 2017
brunol170||40||It's a really nice place to relax and enjoy the nature in the hearth of London. Just go there and enjoy the sun and the peace:) ||August 26, 2017

Fortunately we missed that.)||August 26, 2017
Victoria I||50||Wear trainers it's huge. Bring swimmers and enjoy the lido and lake swimming area. Paddle in the Diana memorial fountain. ||August 26, 2017
Darby I||50||This is the quintessential London park. There are cycling and running paths throughout. Benches to sit and admire the wildlife or the flora and fauna. Several cafe's with food and alcoholic drinks if you're looking for lunch and/or a glass of wine overlooking the Serpentine lake. You can rent horses, rent kayaks, rent pedal boats etc. There are also a lot of events throughout the year like BST concerts in the summer and Winter Wonderland near Christmas time.||August 25, 2017

dulllo||50||My visit to Hyde Park was really amazing. I first saw the Rolls Royce Royal ice cream car. Then we walked through the whole park to the Kensington Palace. It was a long and nice walk. Must visit is the Round Lake.||August 25, 2017
ilyas k||40||Visited twice to Hyde park. Its a beautiful park for a peaceful environment. Beautifully green with a nice experience of boat ride. Its one of a preferred place to visit. ||August 25, 2017
154957N_m_12||50||Hyde Park is a vast expanse of grass and trees — great place for a quiet walk — but its defining feature is the Serpentine where, for a reasonable price, one can rent a boat and drift peacefully around for half an hour. If you're lucky, you may encounter some equestrians along the southern edge. It's like going back a hundred years in time in the middle of a bustling city.||August 24, 2017
Zinnia M||40||My grandson and I spent a pleasant afternoon wandering around the park. It is a welcome break from the hecticness of London.||August 24, 2017
adam_nwuk||50||I love visiting Hyde Park whenever in London. Lots of nice areas to visit - Kids love the Diana playground which is in the north of the park near Queensways underground. Great cafe there too||August 24, 2017
feeleymichael33||50||Hyde Park is a brilliant place that is easily accessible by tube and bus alike. This park is huge and a great place to let the kids run wild for an hour. The lake is nice for walking round with boats and pedallos for hire (not sure of the price). There is a nice little bistro type eaterie on the south side of the lake. It would have been on the pricey side for myself, wife and 5 kids so we did the picnic instead.The high-light was a visit to the Princess Diana Memorial, also on the south side...about a 10 minute leisurely walk from South Kensington tube.There are plenty of deck chairs for hire (I think around £1.60 for a couple of hours) if you fancy a little sit down.||August 24, 2017

Jennifer G||50||For me, Hyde Park was beautiful and interesting. I am a great fan of British Literature and historical romance. Being in this park put me right in the middle of the lives of many of my favorite characters. The Serpentine was a delight to my children as we rented the reasonably priced paddle boat and went to feed the Swans and other fowl. I wish we had taken more time to enjoy it. Next time!||August 23, 2017
Althea W||50||We walked around the Serpentine after visiting the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain - I'd forgotten what a relaxing and beautiful place Hyde Park and the Serpentine are. There is birdlife, squirrels, beautiful trees, a reflective body of water, colourful gardens, a cafe & an art gallery. Well worth taking time out to take a walk and relax here.||August 23, 2017
jmooney1545||50||This is a relaxing park is the sprawling city of London. We spent time here just people watching and resting our feet after walking all day.

833so||50||Hired two deckchairs by the Serpentine to escape the crowds in Knightsbridge and to sit for lunch overlooking the lake. ....swans and geese aplenty and a nice relaxing time before hitting the shops again.||August 23, 2017
ASarkarM||50||I have heard of Hyde Park my entire life, mainly because it allows the public to hold peaceful protests. This was my first visit to London, and there was no way I wouldn't visit Hype Park! So after some shopping on Oxford Street, we went to a Pret a manger and picked some some sandwiches and salads. We then walked into the park, sat under the trees and enjoyed our picnic lunch. We lay there for a bit, while watching office-goers play frisbee during their lunch break. It's lovely to have such an massive open green space right in the middle of the city. Had a lovely, relaxing afternoon.||August 23, 2017
schmidtmg||40||Walking through Hyde Park is always a pleasure, in sunny , windy or rainy weather.... it's even more fun if Speaker's Corner close to Marble Arch is busy..... Walking around the serpentine lake is also enjoyable...||August 23, 2017
joumina17||50||we went there in the early morning and had a breakfast pic nic. then we sat by the lake and enjoyed the sun and the peaceful calm atmosphere.||August 23, 2017

thechicagopeasant||50||I absolutely LOVED Hyde Park. It is beautiful, clean (even the public bathrooms) and easy to navigate. We walked through the park every day the week we were there and even went on a run or two. I wish I had my dog there with me! I would move to London just for this park - Why dont we have green space as clean as this in the States?!||August 22, 2017
andrylMellieha_Malta||30||Nothing else than a big park in the middle of a city.I liked more st James Park it's cleaner.hyde park was full of duck's dirt and I don't know how people swim in that dirty water.||August 22, 2017
MarvellousMarcellus||40||Good for hiring a Santander bike just riding up and down for 30mins free.Lots of people, has a water bit for children. Will try and go back next year with my children! Princess Diana memorial..||August 22, 2017

Stuttgartsnebula||50||Amazing place if you need a break from the everyday hustle in fast-paced London. Quite calming, especially with different species of birds :)||August 21, 2017
Emmtravelsx||40||Was pleasantly surprised by the size and cleanliness of this park. It was a nice, quiet space to take a break in the middle of the city. Wish we had spent some more time there!||August 21, 2017
roxys27||50||I've traveled all over the jungles of South America, deep into the heart of the Amazon, and yet one of my best parrot encounters happened in Hyde Park, London. A little known fact, there are roughly 6000 wild ring necked parakeets that call Hyde Park home. I had no idea, but as I was walking through the park I heard parrot calls and followed my ears. I found a local guy who comes everyday and feeds them. It was one of the coolest experiences of my life. If you are fortunate enough to get to meet some of the wild parrots of Hyde Park, please make sure you give the feeder some cash for seed. Bird seed is not cheap and this is a great thing he is doing. Try going at sunrise or sunset.||August 20, 2017
shostito||40||Good place to take a walk or just chill and have a picnic. Garden spreads out to other gardens like lady Diana memorial garden. No entrance fee required. ||August 20, 2017

816shaniw||30||A great place to picnic and it's a very relaxing place to visit. My main issue is how the deck chairs are not free and you will be charged just for sitting on them which seems ridiculous to me as they're only chairs.||August 20, 2017
nkwhitney||50||Our hotel was just a few blocks from Hyde Park making it very convenient to visit. One day we rode bikes around the park and the other we just walked around and visited Kensington Palace. A nice peaceful experience away from the hectic tourist areas around London. ||August 20, 2017

MarkFairhurst||40||When we went here the park had a fair there. It was called Winter Wonderland and we had a ball. From the warm wine to the hog roast it was simply great fun. We shopped at all the stalls and we had a great time.||August 19, 2017

R4667TYsimond||50||Like other parks in the city it is spectacularly beautiful and well-kept; add to that the size of the park and the fact that there is a horse riding track with soft ground all around it (on which there never were any horses when I was there) and you get one of the best running experiences you can hope for in a city.||August 19, 2017
ryangeddes123||50||you cant beat getting an ice cream and a little bit of people watching ! Sit back relax and watch the world go by ! ||August 18, 2017
Robert V||50||Locals and travellers alike visit Hyde park to admire its beauty in the center of London. If you like to jog, run, ride a bicycle, or just to relax, this is the place to enjoy the outdoors. It is such a huge park! Concert goers, such as the Barclaycard British Summer Time, enjoy concerts here in the summer time. Reportedly, all 65,000 of us! Overall, Hyde Park is Highly Recommended for its beauty and serenity!||August 18, 2017
GZM1973||50||Hyde Park is the place to on weekends mornings.Lovely and romantic walk with many options...the Serpentine lake is gorgeous anytine of the year...the Speaker's corner is the place to go on Sundays...||August 18, 2017

aorton||50||Hyde Park is beautiful. It is the prefect place to spend a few relaxing hours in London. Once you are inside the park it is so quite you easily forget you are in the middle of London. There is a very large pond in the middle that you can rent paddle and row boats. It is a little expensive because they charge by the person for the half an hour. Recently my family rented a paddle boat for an half an hour. Half an hour was plenty. They do require younger children to wear a life jacket. My 6 year old had to wear a life jacket (provided at the dock) while my 12 year old did not. The kids really enjoyed the Princess Dianna Memorial Fountain. If you are traveling with young children and it is warm be sure to bring either a swimsuit or a change of clothing. They will get wet! Next the Memorial there is a small cafe as well as near the boat rental place.||August 18, 2017
Valerie H||30||It's a cute park right in the middle of the town, but nothing to write home about. The weather probably affected my opinion.||August 18, 2017

Jay W||50||Admittedly one of my favourite places in London and I have visited it since my childhood.A recent visit had us taking a long walk through Hyde Park and, through rain and shine, this place will never let you down. The ambience of the park is superb and it affords various opportunities for just hanging out, relaxing and people watching as the mood takes you. It's like being in an oasis of cool calm within the centre of London. It's regal, it lets you breathe and reflect and it's a great antidote to the busier areas of Knightsbridge, Hyde Park Corner and Oxford Street that surround it.Great in any season - I can be and have been happy in this place in high sun and freezing winters. It's a real tribute to the melting pot of London and can really infect you with a happy capital vibe in the most gentlest of ways. To be enjoyed because I always do so here. Sipping a cool drink or a hot espresso by the Serpentine here - what's not to like?||August 17, 2017
steveandpat||50||Went with our grandchildren wildlife great walks nice cafes princess Diane's memorial kids loved it all as we do everyone should come .relax and enjoy||August 17, 2017
JSfromDC||50||Hyde Park is impressive and worth a stroll when you are walking from Westminster Abby to Buckingham Palace.||August 17, 2017
gary_020283||20||The park is unkept at many sections.Grass and weeds were long and there were horse poo at many path ways.Because the grass is long, you can easily step on a pile of dog poo an that was what almost happened to me.The round lake was also filthy. There was a dead bird's carcass floating when we were there.||August 17, 2017
DEREKCullen||50||Great place to go and chill out on a warm summer's day,plenty to do for the kids and great location for a picnic.||August 17, 2017
Roger S||40||This park is one of many in London. It has beautiful flower gardens plus many, many paths to walk. Take time to walk around and not just drive by. ||August 16, 2017
Jeffrey N||40||This wonderful open park area was close to my lunch location so I went afterwards. There is a mixture here of open space as well as walks between trees. Also it is possible to walk right round the Serpentine lake which has boats for rent and plenty of birdlife. Of course it is busy but still you can feel that you are not in a capital large city. Plenty of benches to sit on and enjoy the peace and quiet. ||August 16, 2017
Wanderer52149||50||We took our two young children to Hyde Park one Saturday morning in July, we all had a great day. We got off at Knightsbridge Tube station and first went to the children's playground near that entrance. It was busy but our kids enjoyed playing on the equipment. Next we went for a walk along the Serpentine all the time dodging the birds that inhabit that part of the lake. Next up was the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, a great memorial for the kids to explore. Finally we made the trek across the park to the Lady Diana Playground were our kids had a great time climbing all over the pirate ship. A great place to visit with the family on a fine day. ||August 16, 2017
jtaylorxc||50||Hyde Park is a beautiful and giant park! The giant lake in the center is full of birds including ducks and swans! There are large patches of grass you can lounge on, and the memorial fountain is very nice. The park also offers great, but distant, views of the eye and Big Ben.||August 16, 2017
sigrunastaa||40||Wonderful place to spend some time. It was quite but still full of life. The traffic is also pretty "polite". I would definitely recommend spending a day there in the sun.||August 16, 2017
gonzalob211||50||I think the Hyde park is a place that you must visit during your stay in London. Plan your visit to stay at least half day, make a picnic and just walk around||August 16, 2017
gdepommereau||50||There is a magic moment when you discover by surprise the statue of Peter Pan overseeing the Serpentine. This calls back a flash of memory from your young years when you watched Peter Pan from Walt Disney the first time.||August 16, 2017
jonkjellberg||50|| . There's the lovely Rose Garden, at least a couple of restaurants by the entrances, and lots of tree cover and bike paths. The park is immense, and can take quite a while to explore all of it ,The park is easily accessible from the Hyde Park Corner Underground Station, Lots of open green space. It is also located near other tourist attractions like Buckingham Palace and the Wellington Arch. The park itself is huge and even though we spent a couple of hours here, we only saw a fraction of it.||August 16, 2017
from_Annabel||50||If you love pretty view on sunny days right in the heart of busy London, Hyde park is the place to go! I absolutely adore spending time here - there are decent places to eat out or grab a snack, the Serpentine with all the wildlife to photograph, feed or just observe (do bring some unsalted nuts or seeds along rather than bread - it's better for the birds), you can bike or skate or exercise here, or just sit on square miles of well-kept grass. I especially love bringing a picnic blanket and food :D In summer, you can go on boats or there's even a little beach where you can swim (altough I'm not sure I'd do that, hehe). Nice playground for kiddies on the Knightsbridge side. And if you fancy a lovely horseback ride on one of the wide, well-kept horse tracks in the park, why not check out Ross Nye Stables ;)||August 16, 2017
R1978KNkims||40||We just loved our walk through Hyde park. it was a beautiful day and such a sweet park. Hubby also did a run through the area and liked it, but felt it was a little crowded for a jog. ||August 16, 2017

laureneldub||50||During our trip to London, my husband and I went on a picnic here with some friends. The park is so pretty and clean, sits right next to Kensington Palace, and has plenty of room to stretch out. We sat close Kensington Palace, which worked out well because we were able to use the bathroom in their gift shop/café, and we also explored the gardens right there, which were delightful. We also enjoyed that we were able to bring in bottles of wine and cans of beer for our picnic (we are from the USA, where this is not allowed in most public places). Having a picnic here made for a perfect, low-key day in London and was a great way to enjoy the beautiful weather we were having during our vacation.||August 16, 2017
Netta D||50||We explored just a small part of the park and enjoyed every moment! don't skip the Serpentine lake with the swans||August 16, 2017
MikeE715||40||Enjoying the time we walked through park on our way to City of London and gates, the city where the Queen asks the mayor for permission to visit. I'm sure it's not denied but just an older custom that's followed. Place to buy food if you care to or pack a picnic, but a good stroll if you like and historical. ||August 16, 2017
bel9648||50||We decided to walk through Hyde Park on our way to the Serpentine Gallery. It was a glorious morning! Cafes were open; boats could be hired; joggers and cyclists were enjoying the good weather. We were impressed by the floral displays and the 'wild' areas for the bees etc.||August 16, 2017
kazlan13||50||I take a stroll here for an evening walk. This park is so big that I couldn't even explore half of it. Beautiful lake, scenery, swans, geese and ducks are everywhere. ||August 16, 2017

Steelface||50||Ice creams, lakes, open areas, people taking horse riding lessons, statues, there's a lot going on in this gem of a park. Lovely on a sunny day||August 15, 2017
NuttyClaire||50||This park is a really beautiful place, very big and not at all what you expect to see in the middle of London. In fact you kind of forget that you are still in London as you walk around. Bikes are available to hire but be warned there are quite a few areas that are no cycling zones. There is a lovely big lake where you can hire pedelos and some lovely gardens to walk around. Cafe seemed very highly priced, in fact a small bottle of water was priced at £2 which was more expensive than the litre sized bottle we see in Harrods. So I would suggest bring a picnic if you are planning a visit.||August 15, 2017
Fried58||50||Hyde Park can be visited all over the year, but it is recommended to visit it in Autumn. it is marvelous to admire all the plants and species and the look to Buckingham Palace.||August 15, 2017
peterhanson05||50||It's a huge park in the middle of London and it's alwalys full of people. What I really loved about it: the squirrels that climb on your shoulder and if you're lucky you can take pictures with them. Great experience for animal lovers!||August 15, 2017

Spencer_Voakes||50||We fancied a walk after doing some shopping so we drove in to Hyde Park and parked in one of the car parks there; it was a Sunday so the car park was busy but there were parking spaces available. The only downside is that the car parks are a tad expensive but the convenience of being in the park was great.With the sun being out the park was busy with loads of people in boats on the water, swimming in the lido, walking and relaxing. We walked to the Albert memorial then back to the restaurant by the lido go some bits so we could go and sit by the Diana memorial. My daughter also loved seeing the horses going by and would like to go up and go ridding one day.A great place to walk, around the lake, sit down on one of the deckchairs or under a tree - have to agree with other reviewers that it is a great place to unwind, in the centre of London. Well worth a visit to get away from the hustle and bustle of London.||August 14, 2017
mattr449||50||I probably only saw about 10%, if that, of the park, it is so vast. The park is beautiful, I really enjoyed my time there, even if it was only a short amount of time.||August 14, 2017
AbuHammad||50||I can't think of London without Hyde park; the corner, the lovely walks (on good days), the ice cream cones with the flakes, the squirrels. Ah memories...||August 14, 2017
Markphmnh||50||This lovely park in the center of London ought to be on everyone's list. From the speaker's box near the Marble Arch, the Serpentine water, the Princess Diana memorial, or just a lovely stroll through the park. It's a pleasure. ||August 14, 2017
U6793KDtonya||50||Fantastic day on the pedalos at Hyde park and relaxing within the grounds thereafter. Perhaps quite pricy for pedalos (£12 per adult per hour), but I guess it's London city centre after all - worth doing ||August 14, 2017
rtaryl||30||It is famous again because of the stone 'speakers' corner'. Besides this symbolic reason, it is just like a park that many big countries have. For a leisure evening, it is worth a mild walking for elderly people.||August 14, 2017
redbearon||50||Hyde Park is a great place to relax as you walk between sites. There are plenty of places to sit, watch colorful birds eating out of the hands of visitors, or rent a boat to float in the sunshine. I found it a nice way to catch my breath and slow down as I walked through the lovely grounds.||August 13, 2017

Losyankies||50||If you go to London, don't miss this amazing park. It is of course an English park so everything is pristine and perfect. If the weather permits, have a picnic there. There are several children's playgrounds that are beautiful. Go to Diana's memorial and also to the children's park. Even my teenagers had fun there!||August 12, 2017

farah2245||50||Hyde park is of the most beautiful places to escape to nature in London. The pond, the pavilion, and beautiful routes around give you the chance to unwind and destress. A great place for families, friends, even runners or dog walkers. A feast for the eyes||August 12, 2017
The_Traveling_Bubbs||50||Perfect park to take a walk in. We found a good spot of grass and just layed there and took a nap in the sunshine. Lots of walking paths around the park, we suggest heading towards the lake and walking there. We also stopped at Lido Bar and Cafe on the south side of the lake for some tea.||August 12, 2017
Gunnar G||40||We entered from Hyde Park Corner and first walked through the relatively new rose garden that also has other flowers.

Colleen B||40||So, we had been to Westminster and Buckingham and up the Wellington Arch and walking, walking, walking. If I had understood how big Hyde Park really is, then I would have put this place on a different day where we could have relaxed and enjoyed. The flower gardens were so beautiful and a lot of people around us were having a nice relaxed day, but we walked, walked, walked on our way to the History Museum on the other side. Plan time to spend here and you will rate it "Excellent." ||August 11, 2017
T3275KGchristinem||50||This park is nice and relaxing. Take your time to walk around, relax and enjoy the scenery. It's free open to public so why not enjoy it while it last.This park is good for anyone.||August 11, 2017

982lucyh||50||This is a lovely park, the Diana memorial was great and it was lovely to see so many families using it. The lake was also great - lots of boats and pedaloes which were in use. There were lots of birds around and in the pond by Kensington Palace which was amazing but watch out for the poo! ||August 11, 2017
AlexL390||40||Well it's a park slap bang in the London lots to do water walks rides certain times of year Pretty tidy and clean well done Could do more for the locals o think London please keep it up tho more places in England need to better better like this place ||August 11, 2017

lizardtiff||40||Hyde Park is a chance to walk in nature right in the middle of a huge city. Some of the grounds are manicured but most are not and grow naturally. There are lots of interesting plants and animals, with a great variety of birds. Many people were there feeding the invasive ringneck parakeets. Even though I was there in the middle of the day on a Thursday, there were people everywhere enjoying the weather, laying in the grass, playing with their kids or dogs, and picnicking. I could hear languages from all parts of the globe. The different sections of Hyde Park give different offerings. The Italian Gardens have nice planted plants and sculptures (including one of Edward Jenner who invented vaccinations). Kensington Gardens is where most of the people are where they can paddleboard among the swans. The Peter Pan statue and Princess Diana's memorial fountain also had a lot of visitors. You could spend a couple of days strolling to see everything.||August 10, 2017
Tychoo72||50||This is a huge huge park. There is a little palace in it and it links to many places. Good place to relax, exercise, picnic, cycle, jogging....whatever you can think of. Every exits bring you to different places. You have bayswater on this side and Knightsbridge on the other. Just walk the park and you will see many places of interest.||August 10, 2017
chrisK7351IU||50||Absolutely massive park with a variety of things to see and do. They have an awesome circular river type thing which you can paddle through. It was a nice surprise to stumble across. Boating pool and home to Winter Wonderland in the winter! Great park to escape from the city life for a bit.||August 10, 2017
Leon N||50||This is a vast and lovely park in the middle of London. There's a huge lake running beneath a bridge, with boating, ducks, geese, fowl and, if the weather's cold on the coast, sea gulls that will hover above your head to catch pieces of bread that you throw them. You need at least a couple of hours to do justice to the park.||August 10, 2017
D7mi0||50||We did really enjoy the stay here. The atmosphere is great and the restaurant there has delicious food ||August 9, 2017
G7176UDlaurad||50||Hyde Park is a must see. Lots of trails and ponds - our favourite spot is at the serpentine restaurant. Near to the pond so kids can feed the ducks and paddleboat, but close to bathroom facilities, food and of course drinks!!||August 9, 2017
twoteeps||20||People need to remember that rubbish doesn't put itself in the bin. The Marble Arch entrance is populated by immigrants camped out drinking and playing cards. Not exactly the sort of image I would expect the Mayor of London to be tolerating but he does. ||August 9, 2017
Ninos C||50||This huge park is veritable oasis in the middle of busy London. Perfect for a rest, exercise or just a cup and a snack by the Serpentine.||August 9, 2017
VPlumcake||40||Hyde Park is the ideal place to enjoy a sunny afternoon in London. Quickly you forget you are in the middle of a busy city as you take in the large open spaces and trees. Highly recommend a trip to the Lido on a hot day to cool off. ||August 9, 2017
pegc832||50||Such a lovely green space. I didn't want to walk around shopping and this was the perfect antidote. I hired a bike and took it around the park. The weather was perfect, the sun was out. There are some inclines which made it more difficult to climb especially for someone who doesn't bike often and had done a few laps, but the declines were fun moments. Beautiful landscaping, wonderful little areas, art and architectures, great location so if you got tired and wanted to get food it wouldn't be far.||August 9, 2017
Narci W||40||A picnic here is very nice, just watch out for the goose droppings! You can rent chairs or find a space on a bench near the water. There are a ton of activities to choose from, check out their website and enjoy!||August 9, 2017
rebeccageee||40||Very busy all the time but nice to visit in the summer ! Find yourself a nice spot and simply chill out and relax ||August 9, 2017
birdsley14||50||Hyde park is a great retreat within the city with a little bit of something to offer for everyone. There are rose gardens in the south east corner. Lakes and wildlife throughout. The Princess Diana Memorial Playground in the north west corner is excellent and free for all children (do note that there is water and sand here). There's a carousel. Kensington Gardens and the palace are right there on the west side as well. The Albert memorial is also worth viewing and was a nice surprise as we stumbled upon it. You could spend a day walking through Hyde park if you had the time, but even if you just passed through it would be time well spent.||August 9, 2017
AgnieszkaK296||50||What a beauty! Spent there lovely afternoon. Trees, grass, water, flowers, birds, squirrels and butterflies - what else do you need to get away from the hustle and bustle of busy London life? Everybody will find something what attracts them... just go and see for yourself:)||August 9, 2017
PatrickSeb||40||Had sometime to take a walk around the park and lake . Kid had a fun time watching and pointing out all the birds, ducks and swans. Really nice park to walk around. Nice to see kids having activities outside and all the dogs running around.||August 9, 2017
AFStatie||40||Me and my family strolled through the park at the very end of a short stay in London. Reaaly big park, really beautiful and peaceful. we hired a paddle boat and stayed for an hour on the lake just chilling out. Also, forget the diet and order one of those waffles with Nutella and ice cream at one of the stands in the park. Very nice for strolling and chilling out.||August 9, 2017
Trip B||40||One of the largest parks in the world, Hyde Park id the perfect place in London for some 'alone time' or to 'relax' with someone. It covers acres of land, so don't worry about privacy !!||August 8, 2017
Sam G||50||Hyde Park is so lovely and a must-see! So beautiful to walk around and there are so many sections to wander through. I would definitely recommend bringing a water bottle and light snack - or have a picnic! Just make sure that you bring a blanket or are okay with sitting on the grass as you have to rent the lawn chairs :/ Such a beautiful park :)||August 8, 2017
sadiqmehdi||50||One of the largest public free parks in the world , you cant miss to visit Hyde Park if you are ever in London , if you are in London for a day then this is a place to relax . Not to be missed at all Free and children will differently will enjoy ||August 8, 2017
Stefani1220||50||Spent the afternoon walking through the park photographing the beautiful gardens. Gorgeous flowers, pathways, and the beautiful lake. Had lunch on the patio of the cafe. Food was great! Enjoyed people watching as well as the geese and swans on the water.||August 8, 2017
Palman13||50||After we left the V&A we walked through Hyde Park. Saw the Gardens, put our feet in the Princess Diana water monument, the pond and just a beautiful area in central London. ||August 8, 2017
Danniogirl12||50||Staying up near Queensway and strolled thru Hyde park this morning with no direction, no plan. Had fun watching the swans before heading over to Kensington Palace just in time for opening. Great for those who like to people watch, cycle, or jog.||August 8, 2017
Yvonne0408||50||We arrived at our hotel which was right on the edge of Hyde Park on a sunny afternoon. Strolled into Hyde Park for a leisurely walk. It's absolutely stunning and something to look at, at virtually every corner. We went back again a couple of days later. Loved it||August 8, 2017
A_Birds_I_View||50||We stayed at Bayswater, a 2 minute walk from Hyde Park and Kensington Park. These parks are beautiful green spaces full of friends and families on weekends an enjoyed by many everyday. There's a lake, fountains, trees, flower gardens, walking and running paths, cafes and bars. So glad we stayed near these parks||August 8, 2017
sulaiman2030||50||If you visit london and not visiting the hyde park, you miss alot. I like staying there for 3 hiurs daily. Having coffee or sometimes having lunch there. Setting and relaxing.||August 8, 2017
Cecilie L||50||We ate breakfast and went for a walk in Hyde park a sunday morning. It was raining a bit, but we found a bench with cover from the trees. Beautiful sceenery, and there was a lot of dogs having a great time around with their owners. For us, missing our pups at home, we had a great time watching all of them playing. A great park! ||August 8, 2017
ElsieHColorado||50||This park was so pleasant to walk in, with lots of varied gardens and lots of space to walk in, which was especially welcome after coming from the tourist chaos of Buckingham Palace.||August 7, 2017
Bornabrit||40||Lots to see in Hyde park, just strolling around you will come into and see all kind of interesting things.People horseback riding,people sitting down by the serpentine river looking at the beautiful swans,or visiting Princess Diana's fountain.A great place to take your children.||August 7, 2017
sarahbell190882||50||Hyde park is the host of many beautiful memories from my trip. Hidden gems everywhere and some fantastic secluded spots to relax.||August 7, 2017
Dr-MAtef_Kewan||40||If you are a visitor as my self Sunday is the day you should go, the park is so busy people from different places gathered there, people who dance or play music, giving free lectures and speeches doing shows , on Sunday Hyde park is a big theatre||August 7, 2017
LauraNottingham||40||We had a nice walk through Hyde Park with views of Kensington Palace. The park seemed very peaceful despite there being quite a lot of people around. Definitely worth escaping from the bustle of London for a wander through. A nice place for a picnic and people watching.||August 7, 2017
DublinWelcomesAll||40||Hyde Park has lots to offer. Vast expanses of lawn, deck chairs to sit on, rowing on the lake and Speakers Corner at Marble Arch end to name a few. ||August 6, 2017
Kimchi_Addict||50||This is probably the biggest park in London and it has a rather "natural" feel.l to it in as much that it is not fully landscaped down to the last stone which gives it a nice, rugged charm. Tip1: Princess Diana's Memorial playground is really fun for younger kids (up to about 13 ish) Tip 2: speakers corner (close to Mable Arch) is always entertaining with ppl stepping on a box and having discussions with bypasses about any topic you can imagine. Freedom of speech , raw :) ||August 6, 2017
sdmmb||50||Magnificent green expanse perfect for run, walk or laze around. Good cafes, serpentine gallery always with a visit and why not a swim in the lido. Great for kids.||August 6, 2017
Elaine F||40||There is always plenty of space to enjoy some quality family time.Whether walking,running or cycling.||August 6, 2017
Emily N||50||So peaceful and beautiful here! Went on morning walks and had afternoon tea at the Kensington palace. Must see!||August 6, 2017
Arjen B||40||A nice park and very big too. Perfect for walking to be just out of the hustle and bustle of London. Although it can sometimes be busy in the park. Various features make it an interesting park for walking or cycling.||August 6, 2017
Appledarika||50||I love visiting my old dear friend...Peter Pan!My first visit was more than 30 years ago and I still seeing him from time to time. It's very relaxing place. Swans is so beautiful too.||August 6, 2017
RyanM7105||50||There are many nice spots to sit with my family, and we all enjoyed it. The views were good, any we got many photo opportunities. The lake was a good place to sit near, and was a good way to kill time before dinner. Visit if you have time.||August 5, 2017
WarrenS1178||40||Went to see Tom Petty with Stevie Nicks and this event was run so well. Toilets were top class. Beer was fast, as was the food. Excellent people all around us and the concert itself was very well done. Staging, lighting. So glad i did it !||August 5, 2017
Dant6817||50||When it's not raining, it's amazing to visit this beautiful park. It's great to explore with lots of flora and fauna||August 5, 2017
AmaanS39||40||One of the best parks i have visited. Loved going in the paddling boats with my family and watched the beautiful sunset next to the swans. Very Clean park and outstanding atmosphere. Also great for picnics and walking/jogging. You can definitely breath the pure oxygen. ||August 5, 2017
GB S||50||This was a nice location to walk and get away from the noice of the busy London streets. Many spots to sit and watch and various food outlets along the way as well.||August 5, 2017
angelawN6162MZ||50||A place to relax, an oasis in the middle of London. The Italian water Garden near Lancaster Gate has a lovely coffee shop. Walk through the park to Kensington Gardens and Visit Kensington Palace.||August 5, 2017
Novia A||50||This park was the closest park from hotel that i stayed. It was a very big park (at least for me). You could do running, walking, horsing or swimming (in some area of its river). There's a cafe in its entrance gate from Mornington, it looked nice place to stay and reading book with a cup of coffee. If you walk cross this park you will get to Buckingham Palace and some other attractive places near it.||August 4, 2017
pjhisme||50||Excellent park for walking, relaxing, cafes, museums and landmarks. Was warm this summer so morning walks were best and less crowded||August 4, 2017
CSVanCity||50||We biked around the park after a red eye flight and thoroughly enjoyed it. We easily hired bikes and saw the whole park. We loved the Serpentine. ||August 4, 2017
tabitha22Wales||50||Lovely to walk through the park get away from the busy streets. Nice way to take a short cut. Plenty of benches ,places for tea or coffee break ||August 4, 2017
Lucyj96||50||We always drove past this place on the coach when visiting London and never ventured in but we finally did. Absolutely amazing, at first we thought it was just grass and nothing else, but when we ventured further into the park around every corner there was something to see and do which was a big relief and surprise, we didn't realise just how big the park was. My family enjoyed seeing all the squirrels and wild life, even walking inside of a tree and seeing the lake. Good to see not many tourists like ourselves and more locals. Will definitely be back.||August 4, 2017
A1460TValexc||50||A stroll, a run or simply a drive by...Hyde Park proves to be a wonderful oasis in the city of gardensWhile vast, it has moments from it's quintessential English garden experience to it's swimming kaje frequent by 'polar bearers' offers a multitude of experiences.||August 4, 2017
ch3nch3n||50||my family and I have an annual picnic in the park is massive so there is always space. Its got a lot of trees so there is plenty shade and its just peaceful and calming.||August 4, 2017
651rachaels||50||Hyde park is perfect for a chilled day out walking around the park and seeing the sights available here. Perfect for a picnic. Perfect for kids as you can take outdoor games to play. Must see if you are looking for a relaxing few hours away from the busy city centre of London. ||August 4, 2017
Dave G||50||Great Park to walk around or borrow a Boris bike can get a little over crowded in some areas. Easy access by local transport underground and buses||August 4, 2017
MrDavetheSarks||50||Would come down here every morning when I was in London once and have a cup of tea next to the round pond. The park is huge, and lots of secrets to explore.||August 3, 2017
MartinDee||50||From the palace in Kensignton gardens and Round Pond all the way to Park Lane, Hyde Park has everything you could want. Walk along the Serpentine, visit the gallery, go boating, running, walking, even cycling (stick to the cycle paths). Diana's memorial, cafes, or just vast empty spaces. Little doubt that this is the best park in the world.||August 3, 2017
csobs||50||We had the good fortune to walk this on a beautifully sunny day. There is something almost Parisian about the boating lake, cyclists and sun-worshippers. This a much bigger park than I imagined and a good walk from the edge, around the lake and back out again took longer than I would have expected. We took the opportunity to visit the Serpentine and there is no shortage of other attractions and distractions here, including cafes and restaurants.||August 3, 2017
ChipNewton||50||Park is great for families or for just a nature walk. Reminds me of city park in New York; hugh park in the middle of a busy city.||August 3, 2017
Prit1233||50||If you are visiting London, be sure to go to Hyde Park. Always something happening, beautiful scenery. ||August 3, 2017
Murat Cagatay N||50||Without a doubt, this giant park is a wonderful place for Londoners and tourists to relax. You can spend hours & hours and wipe away your stress just sitting.||August 2, 2017
Yasmeen J||40||I came to the park with many family members including my two year old cousin who enjoyed every second of it. From the playgrounds, to the ducks and the ice cream vans everything was fun and entertaining. The only negative and reason why I have not given this a five star rating is because the restaurant and boat rides close very early and we were unable to eat in the park as we went to the restaurant at 6.30 and the boats at around the same time.||August 2, 2017
ooodi2016||50||Great place to visit. Families enjoy a picnic, well used when sun is shining. Can walk for hours admiring the gardens and wildlife ||August 2, 2017
ScottishTeddy||50||We had made a list of all the placse we wanted to visit when we came to London and we hadn't even considered Hyde Park as one. Thankfully our accommodation was not far away so we walked through one evening and were delighted to find so many interesting sites. The park itself was a lovely green space away from the busy streets and the statues and monuments were incredibly interesting, some of my favourites were the Albert memorial, the Peter Pan Statue and Serenity. On our last morning we hired Santander bikes (only £2 for a whole day) and cycled around the entire park, it was great to see the few areas we hadn't had time to walk to. It was a lovely surprise to find that there are parakeets in the park as well. If your going to London I would recommend taking the time to go to Hyde Park, its a lovely change of pace and great to see a different side of the city.||August 2, 2017
MRahman2013||50||This park has something for everyone. Boating on the serpentine was my fave and later you can eat at the restaurant right next to the lake which serves some delicious pizza. Kids menu is good too so perfect for families looking to unwind. Plenty of events going on at the park as well so do check up on what's on||August 2, 2017
Michiel L||50||Amazing park in the centre of London. Go here for a lovely picnic or a stroll along the water. A lot of activities available.||August 2, 2017
Asswag||50||I really like this park in the middle of London. It is amazing to walk from the hustle and bustle of the traffic and noises - and into the peace and tranquility of Hyde Park. The park measures 1,4km2. Take a trip in the boats on the Serpentine, relax and have a bite in one of the restaurants or bring your own lunch and have a picnic amongst the flowers and wildlife. See if you can spot the squirrels and the parakeets in the trees. Wonderful!||August 2, 2017
607jonna||50||In the heart of everything, yet it's possible to forget you are in one of the busiest European capitals. First time I visited Hyde Park, and now I could not imagine a more perfect way of spending a gorgeous day. Walk, jog or bike your way around the park or enjoy the pedal boats, watching passers by and dog walkers, geese and other water fowl. Great for experiencing a little different side of London. And when you've recharged your batteries enjoying the tranquility and squirrels, hop onto the metro and you are mere minutes away from everything else. Can't wait to be back in London to explore rest of the park.||August 2, 2017
TravellerFaye||40||This attractive popular park provides an extensive green expanse in the centre of London. With sculptures, water features, large established trees, floral gardens, cafes and walking, horse riding and cycling paths, this park is well used and visited by locals and tourists alike.||August 1, 2017

70ish||50||This large beautiful park is an amazing place to walk in the centre of the capital city. There is so much to see the serpentine lake the statues the gardens. There are places to get refreshments and what a place to people watch you see people doing various exercises and tai chi, there are children being taught to ride bikes. A peaceful place in the midst of the busy city.||August 1, 2017
AgostinhoF12||50||A must see in London. An amazing park full of wonderful places. Great for relaxing in the middle of nature.||August 1, 2017
rupertone||50||Thank god for this place! Just when I couldnt take the rat race crowd anymore we got off train at hyde park. Beautiful walk and serenity. Spent the time just walking around the lake. Hardly any people. Loved it ...and its free.||July 31, 2017
42BonnieJ||50||Want a lovely English garden? Want to feel relaxed go there into the garden taking your time in the lovely English gardens. Loved being there away from the madding crowds.||July 31, 2017
TannisRob||50||Hyde Park is a peaceful spot inside a busy city. There is a wonderful lake in the park where thee are lots of ducks, geese and swans. I found it a nice place to chill during a busy visit in London.||July 31, 2017
V5915HFpaulb||50||From Kensington Palace right over to Hyde Park Corner, you could easily spend a whole day wandering and chilling out.A picnic is an option, but there are a number of lovely cafes/restaurants along the Serpentine and nearby in Kensington / Park Lane.Hyde Park Corner is generally good to listen in to the trials and tribulations of whoever has decided they wish to discuss their viewpoints on the world. (Be warned however - these opinions can cause consternation with your own outlook on life, but it's good to talk).The Diana Memorial Fountain is a must for a chilling hour or so whilst the kids enjoy playing in the water. (Bring a towel or two and swimwear for them to fully enjoy if it's a nice day).Many wonderful statues and views over London skyline, but mainly there will be somewhere that will serve to allow your mind to wander and chill out.Would recommend possibly part way through a longer visit to London as its difficult to get round anything and Hyde Park gives a nice bit of respite.||July 31, 2017
freshprince85||50||We walked here from Kensington Palace towards Buckingham Palace. This is the most beautiful and cleanest gardens we have ever been. Lovely place!||July 30, 2017
Adnan-Almuslem||50||An amazing garden and landscapes in the middle of the city, adding more beauty to the beautiful city of London. The area has many excellent spaces for camping, walking and running. The lake is also very beautiful and has some rental boats to enjoy the beautiful scenery. ||July 30, 2017
Peter P||40||Hyde Park is massive - and beautiful! So much green space in an otherwise very built-up city. There are lots of paths to take and enjoy and, while there were undoubtedly thousands of people in the park, it never felt crowded.||July 30, 2017
Space_Bunny_Dolphin||50||Lots going on. Crowded park. Lots of cyclists too. Enjoyed our leisurely walk with family though on a nice sunny day.||July 30, 2017
Michael W||50||No matter how many times you visit, this place is wonderful. Doesn't even feel like you are in London when you are surrounded by greenery and ponds.||July 30, 2017
mctilley||50||An oasis. A well kept park with good signposting. Putting, tennis etc. Plenty to see with the water-ways, statues etc. Pleasant cafes.||July 30, 2017
BambiExplores||50||I went for the BST (British Summer Time) Concert with Phil Collins (and Blondie, K.C.& The Sunshine Band, Mike & The Mechanics + more) on the 30th of June in beautiful Hyde Park. The east end of the park was literally stuffed with people. However, the organisation of the concert was super, so no problems getting in and out, although it took some time, but it wasn't really that bad.It was a excellent experience and I will go again next year, if some good bands are showing up. Please note, if you actually want to the musicians (not only on the huge screens), I will advise you to go for Gold Circle tickets (or better). It's absolutely worth the extra money!||July 29, 2017
DeeTucker121||50||Hyde park is studding, surrounded by beautiful landscapes and even more pictures in the summer.If your ever there, take a trip to hyde park corner always some interesting characters.||July 29, 2017
private1_90732||50||Like most other people I enjoy nature and Hyde Park makes London such a livable city, when life amongst traffic, buildings, shops, etc., becomes too much, its wonderful to just escape to the green grass, shady trees and observe wildlife and even people. It clears my mind and takes me back to my childhood in the countryside. My son wanted to go bike riding so we even tried that, which I found a lot more work...To hire the bikes located around the periphery of the park, you have to be over 18, have a credit card and only people 14 years and older are allowed to ride them. Only certain paths are for cycles, most paths are pedestrians only.||July 29, 2017
SinghCzar||40||This is really a wonderful place for a morking walk or jog as also very pleasant in the evenings.Can spend over an hour easily. i loved the fresh morning air.||July 29, 2017
Marcel S||50||We came here on a nice day, and rented bikes from one of the nearby Santander bike stands. Allow for app 2 hours to explore and take a break by the lake. Like a smaller version of Central Park in New York! Since we went on a Monday it wasn't busy, but can imagine that it gets crowded on a nice sunny day on the weekend||July 29, 2017
Bryan1||50||Well kept park. Traffic bit noisy. Nice cafes. Lots of runners! Princess Diana fountain great for kids.||July 29, 2017
Jim_atl||50||I have spent the past few days near and in Hyde Park. The park is huge and has many areas within it. It is a great place to walk or run and get away from the busy city. You can also visit Kensington Palace at the west side of park. There are many entrances and exits to the park. Enjoy it.||July 29, 2017
dionrenee||50||Hyde Park is one of my favorite things about my trip to London! It's hugs and full of people relaxing with a book, walking or jogging through the park, walking their dog, I wish I could have sat and just people watched. It's a gem and if you go to London it's a must visit!||July 28, 2017
776abdulazizs||30||I'm a not a park type of person, but this can be an exception. I had to walk A LOT to reach the pond/lake all the people take pictures around with the ducks. Personally I didn't like it, but it's was enough that I saw many people with wide smiles on their faces when spending time in the park. Perhaps my best Hyde Park moment was riding the city bike around it, so you rent a bike from a station and take it for a drive then dick at another station as you like, this was much more amusing that looking at the ducks.||July 28, 2017
sneakypeaky||50||Really enjoyed this park and if you are in London and its hot make sure you take your trunks as you can swim in the pond or on the purpose made lido. I think we paid something like £18 for us all but well worth it. How many other places can you swim in the big city. You also have to do a boat ride! ||July 28, 2017
holiday44||40||Been many many times and always pleasant - rain or sine! Walked around the serpentine always majestic. Stopped for a tea and scone besides the lido - walked across the bridge and through the rose gardens. Always full of joggers, cyclists, families, lovely London park ||July 28, 2017
kristina_bryan||50||Visited Hype Park during my trip to London and would have loved to have had more time here. I live on an island so we go to the beach to escape the hustle and bustle and just unwind. But if I were living in London, this would definitely be my go-to place. Just beautiful!||July 28, 2017
amanda-ulricksen||30||I was so excited to rent bikes and ride through Hype Park! The main issues were there weren't a ton of bikes available and, one we found 3 bikes to rent, we immediately noticed only the outskirts (basically back and forth paths) around the park were OK to ride in. Anywhere in the center had "no cycling" signs. A big bummer! ||July 28, 2017
Isaac Y||40||You can feed birds in the park. It is huge and beautiful. It's definitely a perfect location for picnic.||July 28, 2017
bsaxton2015||50||Arrived at our hotel early so we could walk around the park. The park is clean and very well looked after. Just wish we had more time and the weather was better. ||July 27, 2017
Dollcee||50||A lovely walk through Hyde Park. People taking care of using the deck chairs to relax in. Awesome to walk through on a nice day.||July 27, 2017
SuperHaf||50||I spend a lot of time here and I would highly recommend this park, it has an amazing lake is very tranquil. ||July 27, 2017
M K||50|| We visited Hyde Park twice during our week in London. After dealing with crowded subways and busy streets, it was a great place to rest up, relax, and enjoy the scenery. Stroll the various pathways, rent a boat, or eat and drink at a lakeside café. ||July 27, 2017
HayleyNZ87||50||Great place to walk through while in London. Huge area which makes it a nice spot to relax and get away from the concrete jungle. ||July 27, 2017
Alandri M||50||I did not listen to reviews saying spend a day or half day in the park and I regret it. We went by the park to see the Princess Diana Memorial fountain which is stunning and my heart sank as we quickly realized that we needed a day to explore and enjoy the greenery and fresh air of the park, but alas it was the end of our last day in London. So do plan a day here children can swim in the fountain on a warm day (they did on our visit) and adults can walk through and cool their feet. Have a picnic, rent a paddle boat, lay on the grass do whatever. But do take a day away from the smoggy London to give your lungs a rest, relax and enjoy nature. Don't pass this park up. Royal Albert hall is nearby at the southern end of the park as well if you want to go see it.||July 26, 2017
PaulW5401||50||Hyde Park lets you get away from the hustle & bustle of the city. On the west side is Kensington Gardens where you'll find the stunning Kensington Palace, home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (William and Catherine). Running through the middle of the park is The Serpentine when you can rent paddle wheelers. And on the North West corner is the famous "Speakers Corner", which leads to Marble Arch. Throughout the park are many trails that criss-cross in every direction. From Red Oak to Silver Maple; the park has a variety of trees and large open grassy areas.||July 26, 2017
jbushman2017||30||The gardens are in the park along with other walks, fountains and monuments. If you live in London the park is an incredibly large spacious space to get away from the city. To the average tourist, I am not sure there is much here that is notable other than the city has devoted so much green space to this one park. Marble Arch marks one of the corners of the park.||July 26, 2017
christina s||50||We walked through Hyde Park while visiting Buckingham Palace. The Park is massive. Lots of locals jogging, bike riding, children playing soccer. Nice Saturday/Sunday morning stroll if nearby. The palace wasn't much to see unless you plan on doing the tour inside. If not, Hyde Park wasn't a must do.||July 26, 2017
AlmostFamousRocker||40||If you are by Buckingham Palace or in the area, stop by and just take a break there..so beautiful and green. Active area.||July 26, 2017
JTNB2014||50||A lovely leafy park perfect to get away from main City Life. The huge trees canopy the park, plenty of seating along the walkways and it is very accessible to all abilities.||July 26, 2017
sitcharliesit||50||If you're looking for a space to chill, people watch, run, do fitness things, or all of the above, then Hyde Park is for you. I love coming here during whenever I have a layover in London because it's such a great place to people watch - the locals really use the park. ||July 26, 2017
phillipr731||50||On a beautiful sunny afternoon I cannot think of a better place in London to go for a walk,plenty of trees and lakes along with wild life and birds just be aware of the cyclists who sometimes cycle to fast||July 26, 2017
Navigator611141||50||The best park I have been to so far! Has a huge lake in the middle of the park which you can go a paddle boat or a row boat. Can hire bikes to go around the park or skates. A lot of swans in and around the lake not bothered by people and the gardens are beautiful with flowers and fountains everywhere. ||July 26, 2017
110namitad||50||A park worth to spend your whole day with a beer. They have an artificial lake there in the centre of the park. And they have boating as their attractions. Other wise, you can take a bicycle there and enjoy you whole day ||July 25, 2017
Robin C||50||Was staying at paddington during my travel in UK and decided to visit this park for a walk-jog session. This park is pretty big and beautifully maintained. Worth to spend some time here in london.||July 25, 2017
drw2112||40||We took a walk to see the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. This park covers a wide area and they also have a small gallery here and usually displays a couple of different artists. You can also go through and visit the Kensington Palace and Gardens it is worth seeing if in the Hyde Park area.||July 25, 2017
sarah8898||40||The location is my favourite, it was my partner's usual spot to wait for me while I do my shopping! very cute place to have a romantic walk too||July 25, 2017
Catherine L||50||England certainly has the most amazing parks, and Hyde Park is not exception. So lovely to wander through after a busy day to recharge and get back to nature.||July 25, 2017
Allisonarcher||50||As a tourist, I can recommend nothing more highly than a run through Hyde Park. It's a fantastic way to experience all the nature trails, animals, sculptures, lakes, statues, and gardens the park has to offer. Also, amazing views of different parts of the city. This was the highlight of my last trip to London. ||July 25, 2017
RealW0rldTraveller||50||Great place to go for a walk or a run. Park is huge, especially for London. In the summer the park is beautiful with numerous birds in the trees and in the lakes and ponds. Also a great place to people watch.||July 25, 2017

drpeterr23||50||Must do if in London - go in and wander. Great trees and lakes with some sights eg Kensington palace, diana fountain and albert memorial. Just relax and take time out. Lie on the ground and look at the sky through the trees||July 25, 2017

nana_har||50||Lovely park in the central London. Very nice and peaceful. Fantastic place to relax and enjoy the marvelous swans at the Serpentine lake in front of the Kensington Palace.I guess it must be a great experience to walk from end to end.||July 25, 2017
KevinR5410||50||I always like to spend time here when I want to take a short break from the city life. The view of the pond, the birds the walks everything is very relaxing.||July 25, 2017

James R||40||London is chaotic a lot of time. I like going to Hyde park either for a run or walk. Massive space so never feels overcrowded like some parks. ||July 24, 2017
Maureen K||50||This is a huge park on the centre of London. Although you can hear faint traffic noise it is nice to get away from the busy streets. Although the park is full of tourists cyclists people having picnics and office workers eating lunch you can find quiet spots to sit and watch the world go by. There are large lakes where there are swans ducks and geese and usually children feeding them. Good place to recover from sightseeing.||July 24, 2017
jake a||50||We walked into Hyde Park. We had decided to have a picnic somewhere in London as it was a nice day so we sat down in a lovely area of greenery and tucked in. The water shimmered in the hazy sun. It's ever so scenic and I recommend it to everybody!Overall rating: What do you think? 10/10!!!!||July 23, 2017
triptastic104||40||We wandered into Hyde Park on the day we landed in order to beat jet lag. It was an unplanned visit. We happened to find ourselves near the park and my companion suggested it. It was a lovely afternoon and a perfect place to stay awake yet relaxed, something I needed with my travel addled brain. I'll visit again next time I'm in London.||July 23, 2017
AlexBou||40||I went during the British Summer Times (BTS) festival. Needless to say that it was packed with people of all ages. I liked seeing the pond with all the ducks and other birds. There is always something going on there, whether it's a festival or a concert. You could actually spend a big chunk of your day there and have lots of fun (especially if with a group of friends or with family.If you're visiting London, just ask the hotel or look up online to see what events are happening at Hyde Park. Beautiful park to visit and relax as well.||July 23, 2017
pete B||40||We had good weather for a walk in the park, took a picnic and sat listening to the speakers corner. Lots of people but so much space, I didn't know it was so huge. Renovations being done to some paths but no real inconvenience. Made a nice escape from the bussle of the city, ||July 23, 2017

Div_indian||40||Its like the Huge land of green with ponds and loads of deers. it was a great experience to just go and relax there. Great place to take kids and do picnic||July 23, 2017
irma2017||50||I have visited the park time and again and every time I discover a new dreamy corner which takes me back in time, waiting for Victorian heroes to appear. And of course ample spaces to stroll, picnic, jog.... Wonderful .... Once a squirrel came right next to us as we rested on a bench!!!!||July 23, 2017
drmahahashim||50||I have been coming here since I was a teeny tiny tot! My parents would bring me here in a pram and I would feed the geese and swans in the lake. As an adult now, I have brought my nephew and niece as well as coming here with friends and riding the pedal boats. It is a lot of fun but be prepared on a hot, sunny day, you will roast in the Sun and an umbrella would come in handy to protect from the Sun. A good idea to bring some music to relax while pedalling! We then went for a little walk around the park and the Prince Albert Memorial which closed in 1983 and was revealed again over 20 years later! Amazing work and a landmark that has to be seen in London.||July 22, 2017
15gigi||40||We only walked through the park on the path from one area to another, the park was bustling with a variety of folk and many children.||July 22, 2017
635carynd||50||We rented some lounge chairs to rest our feet after walking around all day. It was very lovely to sit and people watch as well. We got ice cream from a vendor in the park ... it was a nice end to a great day.||July 22, 2017
debbiedR1391MI||50||We went for a British Summer Time concert, we've been a few times. Well organised, clean, plenty of toilets. Bars and food outlets a little pricey but you know that will be the case. Always good choice of artists and central together to.||July 22, 2017

LMG436||50||After a week of nonstop sight seeing we needed a free afternoon, so we wen to Hyde park. You can go to Kensington palace from here, rent bikes. Walk, Just sit, or take the kids to the princess Diana playground or her memorial fountain (where they can get wet) It is a lovely park||July 21, 2017
janepodo||50||This park is a marvel, different sections, great walking and biking, the memorial childrens' park in memory of Dianna, not to be missed on your next visit to London||July 21, 2017
Malundra||50||I go there as often as I can, and durinh the summer is such a view!!! Also in the fall when is all orange and yellow leaves around. They house a nice collection of water fowl, different species of well taken care for birds. Please enjoy the view but don't feed them bread as you could contribute to common nutritional diseases in birds: They are not ment to feed on bread crumbles.||July 21, 2017
orrenozkilgour||40||My girls loved seeing the swans swanning about. We had a nice lunch there and walked to Buckingham Palace.The gardens are very well maintained and have a nice, family safe feel.||July 21, 2017
Ladrianus||50||One of the best parks in London with many activities to do including cycling, boats, etc. and very friendly and lively during summer when you can get tanned enjoying the sun. ||July 21, 2017
nhmom27||50||We spent a lot of time in Hyde Park during our week long trip in London. From the beautiful statues to the green spaces and water, it's hard to say what we liked best. It was nice to see people out enjoying the fresh air whether biking, walking, running, or paddling on the water. We ate lunch at the Lido restaurant which was on the water and quite good. A must see for kids is the Peter Pan Statue. Londoners are lucky to have this place!||July 21, 2017
rrraffy||50||The park is located in the centre of london, around many attractions around it.the park itself is giant, with lots of animals and a great cafe.you can also rent a bicycle||July 21, 2017
alice42017||50||We spent the day riding around park on Santanders Bikes really fun. They have cycle lanes so we did not have to negoiate traffic.||July 20, 2017
AboudyG||40||The sense of friedom in this green haven in London is strong. And finally, a place to relax after the hyperstress of Oxford street.Wish rhere were more trees on the huge but barren lawn.||July 20, 2017
M3048IGsteveh||50||Had a lovely stroll through hyde park before going into the concert. The lake was lovely to sit next to with an ice cream in hand. Staff looking after the place were at hand and very helpful. Shame we had to inform 2 police officers about a family of tourists who thought it highly hilarious to chase and try to kick the wildlife. The children doing the kicking while the parents filmed them. They were removed. Other than that a nice relaxing time spent at Hyde park ||July 20, 2017
Natasha R||40||A great place to plod and explore. There's so much to discover if you have the time but if you just fancy a stroll it's perfect for that too. ||July 19, 2017
rishis656||50||This is the best park I have ever visited. There is so much to do here. You can rent a bike and go all around as it's really not possible to see the entire park on foot. It's simply too big. There are two water bodies in the park. The larger one is called "the serpentine". You can go boating or even swimming in the lido swimming area. Highly recommended. ||July 19, 2017
JSVTR||40||Very large area to explore. Surprised to see many dogs unleashed. Swans standing are surprisingly large and tall, and docile. I petted one. People swimming in the lake a bit surprising as the water does not look inviting. Toilets can be twenty pence to use.||July 19, 2017
difelidi||40||Hyde Park was such a tranquille place. Although it is amazingly busy with people picknicking, running, biking, etc.||July 19, 2017
TravellingScot31||40||This is yet another brilliant London Park. Like all British destinations, maximum enjoyment is a little dependent on the weather. I love it here ... not as busy as some of the others and huge. It has as much going for it in my opinion as the perhaps more iconic Central Park in New York. ||July 19, 2017
Occster||50||Hyde Park is a dog walkers dream - in fact - it's a dogs dream. Lots of paths to wander and sniff, pigeons and squirrels to chase. It can get very busy but even for dogs that do not like other dogs, there is plenty of space to wander and explore.You do need to keep dogs on lead in certain areas due to water fowl, but there is plenty of room for all creatures to co-exist. Food is expensive, so you are best off bringing your own.If you are not tolerant of kids, dogs and people roller blading like it's 1996 - Hyde Park is not for you.||July 19, 2017
John H||50|| Just love london came down for last royal wedding lovely clean and tidy and it is disabled friendly too bonus Very helpful thank you ||July 19, 2017
Jennifer R||50||We walked through during our visit to London, this is a stunning park. Very enjoyable and quiet. Great place to get some quiet and space in the middle of the city.||July 19, 2017
sueskyblue||40||Went to see Tom Petty and Stevie Nicks. A glorious summer's day in England - what could be better! Had a fab time dancing to the music, and ticking another box on my bucket list. The only thing that would have made it better was that we were funnelled out of an exit at the end, and had no idea where we were in Hyde Park. A simple sign saying where you were in relation to the main roads would have saved us hours of walking up and down (and being sent in all the wrong directions by security staff). But a great time had and will be back for whoever is playing next year!||July 19, 2017
jillianjh||50||Hyde Park provides a wonderful contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city. The garden areas are beautiful, especially toward Kensington. It is full of fauna and ornate statutes. It's a peaceful and serene park that has joggers, walkers, bikers, and even a small restaurant near the gate (off Bayswater). It's a good place to spend thirty minutes or three hours.||July 19, 2017
alawyer1||50||Like St. James's Park, Hyde Park is just lovely. It is a great spot for a picnic or a stroll. There is lots of shade, which is nice on a hot day.||July 19, 2017
Frequenter-50||40||Visited this time on a sunny afternoon ( good title for a song?), the Park was really busy with an incredible mixture of people it seemed from all parts of the world getting on and having fun either on their own or with family and friends. People on skates, runners, cyclists, walkers, people doing exercises, walking the dog and much more.The boating lake was doing good business hiring some fairly inefficient pedalos, which were getting blown down to the farthest point from the boathouse and being 'rescued' by the boat handlers.Probably the most expensive ice cream in the UK - 2 small cones for £7.20p for a pee toilets were not up to expectations either.I noticed people feeding the swans, ducks and most interestingly hand feeding the squirrels and some beautiful green parakeets.So on one hand a peaceful oasis in the city and on the other an easy opportunity to be relieved of your cash!||July 18, 2017
Ferial||40||Great place to take some time out from the buzy London streets. Peaceful and well maintained. Great place for kids the ponds and the parks are perfect places to explore with kids||July 18, 2017
JDsale||40||Picked up a couple of bikes from Green Street in Mayfair, bikes in the summer are hard to find inside the park itself. Once in the park you can't cycle everywhere and have to stick to the main roads which is fine but they tend to stick to the outside of the park and a few paths past the Serpentine and the old police station. Nice thing to do on a summer's morning.||July 18, 2017
David W||50||A perfect place in the center of london. nice cafes and museum inside. very cleaned and large place. i really enjoyed running there every morning enjoying that fresh air around. ||July 18, 2017
A TripAdvisor Member||50||Absolutely loved Hyde Park on my visit, stayed there ALL DAY before travelling back to Liverpool, the only place/park ive been to that trumps this is Central Park NYC, will definitely be returning here ||July 18, 2017
briddine||50||Even when the sun is hiding the walks are lovely. Also ideal to walk through from Knightsbirdge to Buckinham Palace and St James.||July 18, 2017
dee s||50||We spent a wonderful afternoon by the serpentine and sat and whiled an hour or two away people watching and enjoying a reasonable priced beer or two. Then a lovely stroll around the lake looking at all the wildlife it really is a haven in the middle of the city ||July 18, 2017
Barbara C||40||If you pick ur timing and weather this can be a nice place for a walk or take a picnic and get some shade under the trees. THe problem is in the summer season various concerts are scheduled, you might like to look these up on the web and part, a large part of the park has a built arena with high wall to keep most of us OUT. If the event is in the day then this is noisy and spoils the peace but some folk obviously enjoy it. One tip is to walk part was down Park lane and then cross into the park. There in the central reservation is the war memorial to animals which is very moving||July 18, 2017
dasjr||40||We were actually here on one of the better weather days for London. Walked around the park a bit and enjoyed the greenery. ||July 17, 2017
Mashhoor A||50||Hyde park is always lovely to visit. We just enjoy the good weather and great scenery, feeding the ducks, and always having a laugh about some duck incident. You can also enjoy a lovely workout by taking a paddling boat in the pond for a spin. Facilities are available, along with cafes as well. Don't forget to get some bread to feed the ducks. ||July 17, 2017
639delphinea||50||If you go to London, you have to go to Hyde Park, especially if this is a nice day. Walk through the park or just relax in a deck chair and enjoy the calm...||July 17, 2017
965jedf||50||It's hard to spend a lot of time in Hyde Park and not come to think that it's the hearty of the city, at least weather-permitting. The park is just so alive. Constant motion but plenty of space to grab your own private stillness. During the summer, when we were fortunate to visit, there's seemingly an event every night that will be fun for someone. In just our short time there we could have seen a Justin Bieber concert (but passed) and did experience a fun celebration of the 4th of July with a baseball exhibition in the park. They held a home run derby with former MLB players and filled the area surrounding this with great food trucks, beer and wine tents and amusements for the kids. These are just examples of the kind of activities pulsing through the park on a given day, and this is aside from the stalwarts like Speaker's Corner, where I enjoyed an hour or so of debate and discussion. If in London it would be a mistake not to check out what's happening at Hyde Park during your time and even if there is no signature event you could easily spend a day wandering, enjoying a picnic and visiting the landmarks around the park, such as Kensington Palace, the Princesss Diana Memorial Playground or the Albert Memorial.||July 17, 2017
kbulney||40||We went here for a concert in the park then again just to walk around. It's a massive park with much to see. If you're not scared to walk for a bit plan on spending a couple hours wandering. ||July 17, 2017
Avellim||50||There are a lot of places to relax. It is clean and organised. We had a wonderful time there, especially with the ducks :D||July 17, 2017

kevinw14774||50||Vast park to relax in during the sunny weather. We spend over 2 hours here just people watching and also admiring the various wildlife in the park lake and shrubs. ||July 17, 2017
Michael J||50||The greenery, the water, the trees and the animals make this park feel like a haven of peace in such a busy city. It is beautifully curated, with some great places to relax on the grass or even on sun loungers. Sitting by the lake on a summer evening is definitely one of my favourite ways to spend time.An absolute must visit in London, rivals any park in the world, lovely setting for a picnic, a bottle of champagne, feeding the ducks or just about anything else.Don't miss it, even if/especially if you live in London.||July 17, 2017
stwadhwa||40||Hyde park is a happening place which on one hand houses loads of nature and beauty..on other hand it hosts lots of events that attracts all sorts of crowd- young and old. You could do a picnic with your friends and family amidst beautiful flowers or under a green tree. Its a huge park and so one can find his/her kind of space to enjoy.I visit hyde park every now and then with husband or friends or both.||July 17, 2017
206rakheeg||50||Hyde Park is so peaceful and green. We spent some time sitting on the green grass. We had plans to visit the Buckingham Palace to see the change of security and had to wait for quite sometime. Sowe chose to sit and wait at Hyde Park. It was a beautiful experience.||July 17, 2017

adamiuk||50||Lovely to see at any time of year. Full of surprises, whether it be sculptures dotted around the park, or very confident squirrels and birds that walk right up to you.Don't miss the Diana Memorial Fountain, it's a rather spectacular feat of water engineering. For a break from the busy streets and crowded subways, definitely take a trip to Hyde Park!||July 17, 2017
tmacaulay||50||We were in Hyde park for the BST music festival. We attended on two nights. Both of which were a completely different atmosphere. We much preferred the Saturday night. We also strolled through Hyde park to Kensington palace on the Sunday. This park is very well kept and just lovely for a wonder.||July 17, 2017

Acinonyx60||40||The sheer amount of park land in London is incredible. Hyde park is less 'formal' than places like St. James park, and larger. It has a feel like being in the countryside, amazing for an in the city park. A must visit.||July 16, 2017

Philip R||50||Great open air venue, plenty of food and drink vendors, it was really good to hear live music from the past, Phil Collins made it even more enjoyable. Security was really good with bag searches etc. Exiting the event was very good with lots of side gates so no funnelling through small exits.||July 16, 2017
JulieONZ||50||A beautiful park to explore in the middle of the city. Entry is free. Paths are well signposted and there are plenty of maps throughout the park to let you know where you are. Nice to get out of the mad city rush and enjoy a bit of nature.||July 15, 2017

Jeffrey Keegan W||40||Hyde Park has attractions that remind us of Princess Diana, that much that is ugly can grow up into something of beauty. Dogs playing and paths that take us all around from Bayswater to Kensington and still somethings may get missed, so go slow and enjoy a day with a sandwich, chicken and bottles of wine.||July 15, 2017

SnadraMae||40||Couldn't really avoid the part, it's so big that wherever we went, we had to pass Hyde Park. Walking through it seemed the best option. Glad we did, very nice, clean, very green and almost felt like we were not in the hustle bustle of London. Great place for families with kids, pets and the like. Lots of people all the time though, especially at the main entrance gate but it is a main tourist attraction. Next time, I think we'll bring a football to kick around!||July 13, 2017
3musketeers24||40||You cannot miss this if you are visiting Buckingham Palace, St. James's Park and Kensington Palace and gardens. All are in the same area. Just nice to walk in the shade and enjoy the weather and observing nature and people.||July 13, 2017

nemesisofpop||50||This place is gigantic. Go when there is no event on and you will be delighted by the giant green space in the center of a very nice part of England's capital city. However, the space is often being used to stage some tremendous event or other. I have recently attended two days of the British Summer Time festival. Pixies, Kings of Leon, Killers etc. Absolutely fantastic. In December they host the fantastic (if PHENOMENALLY overpriced) Winter Wonderland. If you go to London, go see what's on!||July 13, 2017
Spreview300||40||Nice park with good vibes and is well maintained. There are good options for snacks and drinks. Not too busy and would recommend for a walk in any dry weather.||July 13, 2017
Jane F||50||It was beautiful we enjoyed our picnic at the pond. We did take away from Harrods foodhall. We watched the paddle boats . ||July 13, 2017
581lesleyr||40||Excellent experience in Hyde Park for The Killers concert.Very well organised.Lots of rubbish to recycle after the event!||July 13, 2017
Ray D||40||If you love the outdoors with lots of activities going on, then this is a place to visit. Speakers corner is interesting ||July 13, 2017
764sly||50||A great place to go for a run in the morning. Lots of people take exercise in the park or work through the park on the way to work. Takes around 30 mins to run around the 4 mile perimeter of the park. Clean lawns, well maintained grounds. Very pleasant place to come and relax especially on a warm day||July 13, 2017
Tumblinsun||50||This large park brings the London dwellers out into nature and sunshine. Our day was the first of the nicer spring days so it had loads of people out after work playing games, relaxing in the sun, strolling the gardens, boating and strolling. We weren't used to the tame swans so that was a treat.||July 12, 2017
Lisa C||50||Beautiful park tied to Kensington Park, both were absolutely lovely, but we're good walking shoes! The Hyde Park area has lots of great restaurants and places to sightsee around it, and Kensington Park has Princess Diana's fountain and Kensington Palace, all within walking distance!||July 12, 2017
renetab2015||50||We spent almost the whole day here. The park is beautiful and green. The Serpentine is lovely with all the birds around. The fountains or so called the Italian gardens are a very nice spot as well. There is some construction going on where the musicband is supposed to be so depending where you are it could be a longer walk. The only thing I don't like about the park is that the washrooms are not free. It cost 20p and the machines do not return change. So make sure you have coins ||July 12, 2017
bumblepeas_garden||50||Large well maintained park with plenty space for walking the dog or picnicking. Park contains a nice lake and interesting monuments and is free for general public access. There are often big concerts and events which are held here but this can be found out by looking online before turning up. ||July 12, 2017
Dangoh||40||Went for a morning walk to get over the jet lag and was pleasantly surprised by the assortment of activities taking place in the park.Serpentine lake is home to ducks and geese and they make for a wonderful sight.||July 12, 2017
beverlyf440||50||So many options and views- absolutely must spend some time walking through the park and enjoying everything. Sign up for riding horses if you have the time- it is a great way to see the park. ||July 12, 2017
Sharon M||50||Went here end of june to see phil collins it was amazing very well organised event staff where very helpful didnt even have 2 que for toliets i would deafo go 2 another festival there it was a amazing experience expect to spend quite a bit of money as it is really expensive once ur in the festival other than that couldnt fault it ||July 12, 2017
Tim H||50||Took my daughter to see Justin Beiber. While you might not like him the setup of the gig and the atmosphere was brilliant. Even afterwards getting to a tube was well organised and we got the last train home. Great day out. Look out for a band you like and make a day of it||July 12, 2017
helenskiMinnesota||40||Hyde Park is always a good spot to get away from the crazy rush of London workers coming to and fro and tourists bustling around in the streets. Large trees offer appreciated shade during the heat of summer days. Food stands offer refreshments. Recommend to find a bench or sit on the grass as, if you grab a deckchair to rest your weary feet, there will be a guy with a parks vest come and request payment to "rent the chair!" Come on, no way. Other than that, only recommendation is to put in more public restrooms. Went hunting following a sign that produced no restrooms in sight. Do love the park though, a serene spot in the middle of a city with a fabulous vibe. Always stop here for a break and a sandwich!||July 12, 2017
travelingd0c||40||That's about it. Nice open green space. Good place to sit for a while or people watch. Great flower gardens. ||July 12, 2017
Loraine A||40||Hyde park is always good for a walk or quiet sit to think, read or just people watchIt is away from the noise and busy city Stop for a coffee or ice cream or lunch at the cafe near the water Restful and peaceful ||July 12, 2017
VineetMalani||40||Hyde park is great little oasis in this busy city. It's huge, we once approached it from Buckingham Palace side and on another occasion from Oxford street. It has it's own tube station named Hyde Park Corner but Marble Arch station on Central line is also close by. The park is great for people watching, picnic luncheon and an occasional sport. There are portable toilets inside, they also offer lounge chairs for free. Just one hitch, they start winding up and locking those chairs at around 8 in the evening. We enjoyed an early dinner here, getting some pizzas and pastas packed from Oxford Street.||July 12, 2017
holliem806||50||We had such an amazing time here. All really organised. Great members of staff helping us out on where to go etc and handing out lots of water throughout the concert. Also good security. ||July 12, 2017
JanMcD2801||50||Was so sorry we didn't have more time to spend here in Hyde Park - fabulous location in the middle of the city!||July 12, 2017
Руслан С||50||Beautiful place. Incredible Lake Serpentine and Walking Alley Rotten Row. I dream there will come back again.||July 12, 2017

Maupert L||40||It is a great place to have some drinks and watch people. The drinks and food are expensive. There is also a bbq during the summer. On the other it is possible to picnic.||July 11, 2017
TrishH1975||50||I love Hyde Park! It is expanse and such a lovely place to go and wander. There is always a part haven't seen before like this time found the outside swimming area of the lake and a beautiful little coffee shop. I would recommend anyone to take a stroll even if it is just a tad part of Hyde Park!||July 11, 2017
Louise S||50||Staff at concert very helpful. It is well worth the money to upgrade. Well organised event and the music was excellent. Food and drink very expensive. Walk by the serpentine variety of birds amazing!!||July 11, 2017
Mick A||40||It is very big for a city park and seems to be very well frequented by lots of different people, well laid out and has lawns as well as grass and lots of very large trees to get out of the sun if required.Too many pigeons, they could import some birds of prey to keep the annoying bird population down. Swans and ducks look good but defecate all over and that needs to be cleaned more often. ||July 11, 2017
jperrin2011||50||Had an excellent tour on golf cart buggy by volunteers for the parks. This service is for those with mobilty issues (my mom is 84). It is strongly suggested to offer up a donation but so worth it. ||July 11, 2017
helend383||50||Great day, good sound and stage set up, great organisation in and out of the venue, helpful staff, fabulous food available, toilet where clean too||July 11, 2017

samanthajfindlay||50||This is a great park! You feel like a real Londoner walking around in it! It is a great way to see what life in the city is all about! You see people just living their everyday lives. Also, there is a beautiful pond in the park with lots of birds. There are benches that you can sit and watch them from, and there is a small café to get delicious ice cream!||July 11, 2017
sarah h||50||Love walking round this park and take a different route everytime we go. Lots of great stautes, ponds,dog walks and bike rides.... busy on a nice sunny day with people having picnics. Great place to hang out with friends. It's great having this space in a busy city like london||July 11, 2017
Ajitha_Meenadchi||50||It was so beautiful, a very aesthetic place. I would recommend to anyone wanting a nice day out with friends or family or even by yourself. It was very calming and the waffles there are so delicious.||July 11, 2017
louisas737||50||Went here for the two days of the British summer time festival Lovely park, has deck chairs placed all over which you can hire or you can bring a picnic and a blanket and chill out on the grass ||July 11, 2017
788DanielleG||50||Went to Kensington palace then decided to stay around after and relax in the park. Lots of amenities, opportunities to rent bikes to cycle the park. Toilets are 20p in but very clean. Overall one of the nicest parks I've been in||July 11, 2017
Cathryn R||40||Great to see Tom Petty play live with Stevie Nicks at BST in Hyde Park. What a great outdoor venue - the weather certainly helped...||July 11, 2017
365dee||50||The park is almost always occupied with some fest going on. It is perfect place to have an outdoor cinema night with yourself, your partner or your family. Yes, it is huge and is also really close by to the Tube station. The park is within 5 minute walk of the Knightsbridge station and is close to all the shops as well. Perfect for picnics too. Enjoy.||July 11, 2017
macleodScotland||50||Spent a Saturday afternoon in July walking in Hyde Park. Lovely place to escape the busy city. It is so well kept and the gardens are beautiful.||July 11, 2017
wirhannah||50||Hyde Park is enormous, and an amazing setting for BST. Loved the Tom Petty gig, the sound and atmosphere were incredible and the food was good too. ||July 11, 2017
590jonathanl||50||What a great day out!!! Top drawer Rock'n'Roll from these old stalwarts!! Great atmosphere and great facilities! All this in my favourite park!! Looking forward to next year already!! ||July 11, 2017
Kapil M||50||A must visit. Has a number of Swans and play area fro kids to play and cycle. Loved every bit of the time spent here||July 11, 2017
Shawn M||50||Bring fruits or vegetables like lettuce to feed the ducks and swans there. Don't feed them bread.You can play tennis, go on small paddle boats, just sit and watch the ducks, visit huge monuments or just walk around and enjoy the view.||July 11, 2017
Phorte||40||This park is just huge. The maps scattered around the park really didn't prepare us for how enormous it actually is. The outskirts were thriving with activity from buskers to religious discussions. Walking further in during our summer visit had us encounter lots of different people doing different things (from PT classes, to families having picnics). Great vibe. Be prepared for the walk though as once we committed to go halfway, we did feel tired to finish the return trip haha||July 10, 2017
Hamouda-My||50||Beautiful park with a big lake in the middle, several playing ground areas, activities and restaurants where you can grab a quick bite.A must go relaxing experience.||July 10, 2017
ronbrisbane2017||50||There are plenty of bike stations to easily and cheaply hire bkes. The hire system uses your debit card to pay for and track the time of your bike hire. The Park is a Beautiful area to ride through and generally flat. The Serpentine Lake is a gentle area to sit by with a couple of cafes to choose from or for the more active, paddle boats to hire.The Serpentine Lake has a swimming area and is the home to a friendly local swimming club which swims all year round. Refer to their website.Plenty of great sites to see.||July 10, 2017
markwS6538XC||40||Booked tickets to watch the Killers on the Saturday.We turned up to Hyde Park to what was always going to be a busy area with the thousands heading to the festival.The park is lovely, well kept and much like Central Park in New York which I have visited on a few occasions is a break from city life.The festival was great, after recent events it was good to see an high level of security to get into the festival itself.However the festival was crammed into such a small space, there were so many people for that area and in the heat it made it hard work.Drinks and food were expensive but the setting made it worth it.The Killers were amazing and worth every penny.I would recommend the festival next time it's on. ||July 10, 2017
Diana D||50||Hyde Park is beautiful, with the water, walking trails. beautiful gardens. Another must see park in London ||July 10, 2017
Business46||40||This was my second time in Hyde Park. The first was a walk from the north end out the southern end. This time across the north to the Palace. Though it was raining the gardens were looking great, paths were in good walking shape, the birds around the ponds left some gifts for unwary walkers, but all was good. We felt safe at all times, and maps near the park entrances were easy to understand.||July 10, 2017

garm717||50||Every day I started my day off with an early morning run through Hyde Park. I never ended up in the same spot twice. Actually got lost on the trails each day as I did not want to stop running to look at a map. Added to my adventure. In the day we used Hyde Park to cut through to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park has a multitude of statues, activities and trees to see. Some days I ran the perimeter of Hyde Park, I found Embassy Row, made wrong turns into "highly secured" areas, and ended up finding tourist attractions that I had no idea were so close. We stopped to play a game of ping pong on our way thru the park. Had we not been staying by Hyde Park, we would of not utilized the park so much due to wanting to see as much as we could. At 10pm one night, accidentally I was walking thru the park with no fear for my safety. The park was filled with groups of people, even at that time! Make a point of seeing some of the highlights there||July 10, 2017
denisegX3219HW||50||I love this park it is so tranquil and neat. Always filled with musicians and just a great vibe. Lots of vendors too ||July 10, 2017
angie01332||50||We was lucky to get tickets for green day and the killers for the BST festival at Hyde park , the park is very easy via the tube , we got off at Hyde Park Corner , the park is busy but not uncomfortable with runners , picnics , bikes and we even saw a bride and groom with their wedding party ! The festival is very well organised with the best festival food I have tasted defo be back ||July 10, 2017
travelbugs222||50||The amazing thing about this park is that you can be in the middle of the park and not know you're in the city. It was so good to take a day out and just walk around the park, well worth it!||July 10, 2017
lindsay p||50||Hyde park did a really great job at this summer festival. Terrific bars, no queue for facilities and a really friendly happy vibe. Tom petty and Stevie Nicks brilliant!!||July 10, 2017
GA1504||50||Never been to a concert in Hyde Park before but we had a great day. Diamond View so right at the front. 1030 curfew adhered to. Sound was great. Food and drink excellent - so much choice. Easy to get away afterwards as well and whole day well organised. One small point - tickets and website said no backpacks so we didn't bring them. Security still allowed them in.||July 10, 2017
DaveMather49||50||Attended the Tom Petty concert , it was the best organised concert I had ever been to , toilets and food and drink stalls all superbly well organised . Also pre concert we spent a few hours walking around the lake , had a couple of drinks by the swimming area and also visited the Lady Diana memorial . The park is a credit to London and our country certainly rivalling Central Park in New York. Great day ! Dave and Lisa Mather ||July 10, 2017
Catriona T||50||Amazing day at Hyde park for the Tom Petty gig. Fantastic venue -clean, lots of space, food options and a great vibe ||July 10, 2017

Rola Z||40||Hyde Park is a must go destination if you are a nature person, a photography fan, a sports fan. Even on a vacation it's nice to visit parks, walking next to the lake, renting a bicycle for the day, taking amazing pictures. It's worth it. ||July 10, 2017
Rabih_elhage||50||vey big ntural green park. u can chill, run, play or eat by the lake. we didn't walk through it all since its very big.||July 10, 2017
sueg197||50||First time visit to BST and have to say what a fabulous day! Well organised, good facilities and weather to match. The Killers were awesome as ever and we had a great time. Can't wait to see next years line up and hopefully we will return. Hyde Park itself was lovely also and it was great to see London at its best and definitely 'open for business' .||July 10, 2017
Trish K||50||A huge open area . It is casual lawns with mature trees , paths & lakes. Enjoyed by many especially in Summer. Have a walk & sit under a tree in the middle of a significant city . A must.||July 9, 2017
Caroline H||50||Although only here for a British Summertime Festival we were both very aware of the beauty of the Park itself and aim to return again shortly. We loved the way that the paths meander through the trees, which in themselves are stunning. The Park is really well cared for and the river is obviously a huge attraction on a warm Summer's day. Beautiful!||July 9, 2017
RENATA P||40||The park is a must when in town. Everyone knows that. It spacious, there's so much green area where locals clearly enjoy for a good picnic or just a layout under a blue sky. ||July 9, 2017
Malalone||40||A friend took me there as I'd never been before, it was great to escape the traffic for a while and there was even a free music festival in full swing, an unexpected bonus. Lots of people relaxing and having fun. A nice place to be||July 9, 2017
newmonkey||50||What a beautiful place. Spent a fantastic morning wandering the park on a hot day. Fantastic wildlife to be seen round the Serpentine and the wee one cooled her feet off in the Diana memorial stream. Headed in to to see the tourist sights in the City - wish I'd just stayed in the park... !||July 9, 2017
Twoyys F||50||We walked the park to South Kensington to visit some shops, then bought food, wine ans found a perfect place to chill.||July 9, 2017
Kenneth B||40||My five year old loved the Princess Di playground. The sand and water features kept him entertained for hours. The pirate ship was a favorite as well. The only drawback was the bathrooms at the playground were closed for some reason.||July 9, 2017
sean r||40||Love all of London big parks ( Regents my favorite ) & Hyde park no exception, but one bit of advice for a first timer, It's some size & if planing to cross form one end to the other, allow time, take a drink ( there are cafe's ) & wear comfy shoe's. Albert memorial, Serpentine & where it clips Kensington palace at iextreme west end of, all, I think are pretty cool.||July 9, 2017
alison r||50||What a lovely park you have Londoners. Everything was in full bloom, so charming with the children on their ponies, cyclists and dog walkers. I had wished i had a blanket and a picnic basket to chill for the entire day.||July 9, 2017
Linda D||50||We walked the span of the park more than once during our visit. Flowers were blooming, bees were buzzing, people were running, riding, and walking all around us. But even with all that activity there is also a feeling of tranquility and escape within the park. There are monuments and memorials to see, water activities (try the swim club!) to watch, and swans and geese to feed so you can really enjoy a break from the crush of crowds offered by many London attractions in the summer. We thought the Serpentine Restaurant at the edge of the pond was especially good, too. ||July 8, 2017
jessee04||50||I absolutely recommend visiting Hyde Park, even if you can only walk along side it. The amount of space is absolutely stunning.||July 8, 2017
Debbie S||50||Could have spent all day sitting it the park, overlooking the Italian Gardens. Very clean, nice ice cream, deck chairs. Loved it!||July 8, 2017

Had a smashing time, would definitely go again, the location is perfect, love Hyde Park got lots of fond memories here :-) ||July 8, 2017
induvant86||40||A really good place in central London. You could easily spend a day with the options available. I went in the winters there, at that time there were winter wonderland rides available for people to enjoy. Also the food options available were great. A v good place to spend a day.||July 8, 2017
R0sieBr0wn||40||The park is too big and deck chairs are £1.60 an hour. The stall had ran out of ice cream, on a very hot day. Overall great park. ||July 8, 2017
happyholidayn||40||We only had an hour and a half to stroll around the park. But we did find some amazing trees that created canopies. We all walked in and took photos.Super cool! We stumbled upon many gardens in our stroll. There are certain parts of the park that you can get lost in that are flower-less.Beautiful trees and paths to run and walk on, but not as much fun for flower lovers.I know there is much more to this park but for the short time we were there we truly enjoyed the landscape and gardening.Great job to all those involved! Oh, read about the history as to how this was the royal hunting grounds. ||July 7, 2017
Kathy R||50||Spent a lovely late afternoon strolling through Hyde Park....Kensington, Diana's Memorial, the Serpentine, on to Buckingham Palace------time well spent! Horses, Dogs, Swans and ducks---a magical afternoon!||July 7, 2017
Elaine A||50||We attended the British summertime (BST) on Saturday 1st July. The event was well planned, staff were all friendly and the location was terrific. I was impressed how well utilised the park is, from joggers, cyclists and football training amongst other things. Plenty of room and really tranquil in the heart of London. It was great to attend such a fabulous location, would definitely go here again. ||July 7, 2017
Mary T||50||The whether was warm while we were in london, so we were joined by many locals when we sat to rest for a while here in the evening! Beautiful, clean, and peaceful park!||July 7, 2017
traveler202020||40||Don't underestimate the size of this park. It goes on for miles. We intended to simply cross it to go to the Victoria and Albert Museum only to walk delightedly around in circles. This park has everything you can imagine and is a great way to enjoy activities outdoors or just relax.||July 7, 2017
Cruiser804155||30||each time I have visited this park,I have seen numerous rats during the day time.One ran across my foot this time. disgusting somethinmg should be done.How people can swim in ther Lido is beyond me, huge risk of Weils disease||July 7, 2017
chilkoDuncan||50||Enjoyed strolling and running in this huge park. The Serpentine, small lake, complete with boating can be enjoyed by all. Lots to look at, great for people watching. Cycling, running and walking all enjoyed here plus there is lots of wildlife. ||July 6, 2017
HorseShowDad||40||It's been nearly 10 years since I've had any sort of a walk in Hyde Park. I've traversed small sections whilst heading to/from Kensington Palace, but it's been since 2007 that I've simply strolled through any portion of the park. Our path took us from just at Queen's Gate, along the south edge of the park all the way to Hyde Park Corner. The day was on the warm side, but the shade of the massive trees along with a slight breeze kept things quite comfortable. It was midday on a Friday, so crowding wasn't even a consideration. A few youth football (soccer) teams were having practice, but that was about the extent of it. All in all, after days of hustle and bustle in the city, going from venue to venue, this is an excellent place to catch your breath and slow the pace a bit. No matter which direction you travel through the park there are ample bus stops along the perimeter and tube stations dotted around as well.||July 6, 2017
Sharon_jermol||50||A beautiful park with lots of interesti g things to do and see.we even saw some wild parakeets and we saw the princess royal at a passing out parade.....which ever exit you leave at there is always another landmark next to it||July 6, 2017
SherryG487||50||our family spent a week in London, staying in Kensington area. We were in the park almost daily, taking a different route each time. Still have not seen the whole park. Looking forward to our next time in London.||July 6, 2017
AnaGonzaloMoreno||50||Hyde Park is such a beautiful place to visit. It is awesome! You can see the chipmunks running around the park!! ||July 6, 2017
Martin G||50||It was lovely to walk across the Park and enjoy the trees, plants and statues on our way to museums and back to the hotel. Great feel on the Sunday afternoon when it was in use by many people with their families and dogs. Lovely water features, Squirrels!!||July 6, 2017
jasonotte||50||What a great walk this is with so much to see along the way. Love the way people just randomly sit anywhere and chill out. It's great place around Princess Diana memorial with a superb little cafe which serves alcohol. Definitely recommend. ||July 6, 2017
marklG5856VA||50||I love Hyde Park for the opportunity to get away from the noise and grime of London. It is an oasis of almost tranquility in the big city. There are plenty of green spaces to relax, play games or do whatever floats your boat on a nice day. If it is too sunny, there are plenty of trees to get a bit of shade.There are the lakes and a number of places to get refreshments. ||July 6, 2017
Blondini2013||40||Hyde Park is very large. Has a few exits (which I found after getting lost). Quite pretty and each exit comes out onto a different area. Well worth visiting ||July 6, 2017
Wendy V||40||We walked through Hyde Park, amongst all the people enjoying a beautiful day and feeding the swans and pigeons. It seemed like all of London was out enjoying the reprieve in weather, and walking, picnicking on the lawns, feeding birds, wading, and sitting on benches. The park is huge with a beautiful lake and enormous trees with lots of grass and gravelled or paved paths. The Diana Memorial is there, where you can paddle and cool your feet. The walk along the long narrow part of the Serpentine is lovely, with lots of swans and ducks to feed, and a place to swim.||July 5, 2017
jlovisa||50||Such a big park and a lovely 5 km walk with my dog and younger brother. We stayed for a coffee and really enjoyed our walk ||July 5, 2017

Laur12345||50||We walked from one side of Hyde Park over towards Kensington Palace, which was a beautiful walk. The park is a great place to spend an afternoon picnicking, playing, hanging out, or reading - it's quiet and not crowded (usually), with lots of places to sit with a view.||July 5, 2017
David M||50||A really well organised and spectacular event out on with imagination and creativity - worth every penny.||July 5, 2017
lancslass86||50||This is one of londons larger parks. It's great for the sunny weather, Diana's memorial fountain is great way to cool off. There is loads to do, places to eat and toilets available. There was people using the lido and out boating on the lake. A lovely place to sit and relax in the sunshine.||July 5, 2017

782helend||50||We visited Hyde Park whilst in London recently and was quite taken with it. Beautifully laid out, lovely lake and extremely well planted. We also went to BST to Phil Collins there as well. Was amazing and set in a lovely setting||July 4, 2017
Albia-Newton||50||Went to see Green Day Concert as part of the BST Festival.Superb organisation - and a really good festival venue.First time to this event - Would certainly go again.||July 4, 2017

iernie||40||A big and nice park in the middle of the city. Nice for taking a walk, relaxing and feeding the birds in the water. Walk your dog or have a hot dog.||July 4, 2017
DVB311||50||Huge, clean, green and relaxing. Ideal for walking, running, bicycling or just relaxing in the tree shades.||July 4, 2017
ksb9x||50||We walked through the whole of the park and now want to go back again and have a picnic. It was just so pretty and everyone seemed happy with their families walking through.||July 4, 2017
MezFank||50||We thought we'd walk through Hyde Park... but found ourselves stuck there for hours, the kids desperate not to leave. I loved the slightly tamed wilderness of parts of the garden, contrasted with the carefully planned and manicured formal sections. We stumbled upon a tree filled with tame parakeets, which ate out of our hands. We are entirely in love and the kids now want to move here from Australia permanently. ||July 4, 2017
PaddingtonBear9995||40||Hyde Park is worth a trip for all ages. You can rent bikes, pedalos and row boats but even just wandering the park is great as well. On foot you can find a lot of nice paths that you are not allowed to go on by bike. In the northern part of the park there are the Italian Water Gardens, which are absolutely beautiful with fountains. Definitely worth a visit while in London if you like to wander or have somewhere for a jog. Be prepared for it to be very busy during the summer weekends. There is even a place to go swimming at the Serpentine Lido.||July 4, 2017
claygreenaway||50||What a wonderful park. Very easy access via tube, bus and foot. Beautiful scenery, ideal for joggers, cyclists, walkers and just for chilling out people watching. Plenty of room for lityle people to let loose and run about. Ice cream vans scattered around for refreshments ||July 4, 2017
Stiches3||50||Spent the day in Hyde Park. A lot to see and do. Must stop at Kensington Palace Must see the fountain tribute to the late Princess Diana. Grab a bite to eat near the lake and have a nice stroll. ||July 3, 2017

Leo07Ch03||50||We visited it during December when we were visiting London!! The area there, with all the trees, flowers and grass is beautiful!! You get once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to come in contact with some of natures most beautiful creatures, like swans and squirrels!! The river is absolutely stunning, especially during the sunset!! Very nice place to relax and generally a really beautiful enviroment and place to visit!!||July 3, 2017
Mikko T||50||Nice park for picknik or just for walk. Quite a lot of peoples during weekends, what is good. Lots of things to see when peoples doing their performances over there.||July 3, 2017
Stephen M||50||Lovely large park area in central London prefect for a relaxing walk or just sit and watch world go by. Kai visit during December for winter wonderland which is well worth a visit whether during day or at night tho personally I'd go at night when it's all light up ||July 3, 2017
IheartIreland||50||Hyde Park is a Beautiful park! There is a playground dedicated to Princess Diana as well as a water memorial. The day I went there were aerial artists doing trapeze. You can sit by the water and eat, drink, or have ice cream, watch the ducks, swans etc. It is just a peaceful place and I thoroughly enjoyed walking through it and taking it all in.||July 3, 2017
WWTravell||50||Greta place but weather was also good so was a big influence. Lots to see and do very relaxing. Excellent place for thee concert wide open and plenty of space .But as with all concerts prices sky high. Great walking area although so many runners makes it less of a relaxing walk. Horses are also allowed but didn't see any||July 3, 2017
deaddog3||50||A excellently run event. Well organised, clean and tidy toilets. Very helpful staff and above all, excellent acts. In view of all the problems with terror alerts the security checks were fast, efficient and successful .||July 3, 2017

francien2015||40||We bought some sandwiches bread and cheese at Tesco and made our own snacks in the Park really enjoyable and cheaper than dining out ||July 3, 2017
941TerryH||50||Grounds are pretty smart, certainly a good venue for a gig, especially when you couple that with some decent sunshine (doesn't happen often) one tip.. if you are going to a gig call to the Tesco express which is fairly close (Save a fortune) ||July 3, 2017
georgieg680||50||This park is amazing and links up with Kensington Gardens.Don't be in a rush - just take time to wander - particularly if you are here June/July - it's wonderful - an absolute must.||July 3, 2017

441michellef||40||A lovely day walking around famous Hyde park with the various sights to see including swans on the river, Dianna fountain memorial, horse riding school and the unbelievable speakers corner ( which has to be seen and heard to be believed ) The park had plenty of open areas to picnic and play some sports ||July 2, 2017
Day_tripper1234||40||Stunning park, a real treasure in the middle of London. Lovely walk around on a hot summers day doesn't feel like its in a bustling city||July 2, 2017
StewieYWG||40||Hyde park is enormous, so you'll need some time to take it all in. From Kensington Palace at the West end, to the summer concert grounds at the East. The Diana memorial, Long Lake, Round Pond, the Albert Memorial, etc....and take a camera!||July 2, 2017
LL156||50||Hyde park is wonderful! Phil Collins was very well organised but Greenday seemed so unbelievably unorganised it was laughable.Nothing to do with Hyde park but the numerous emails you get for these events telling you not to take this and that was total rubbish people had blankets and huge bags. Various people smoking drugs.The food stall are super expensive as expect but great street food.All in all a fantastic weekend! ||July 2, 2017
u4313464||50||Huge park, plenty of great picnic spots. Lots of great jogging tracks. Well worth the visit, if you need a break from the concrete and brick jungle of London||July 2, 2017
sheffieldeats||50||Linger by the Serpentine, break for a snack at the Lido, look out for ducklings, pedal a pedals. A green artery of the city for all to enjoy.||July 2, 2017
Tony L||50||Went with my daughter and wife. Had an amazing day. The boat lake was a bit pricey but well worth it. Kessington Palace is stunning too. Princess Diana has a memorial there too which is wonderful and fun for the children. ||July 2, 2017
ortwena||50||Nice walking around you can get bicycle some fresh air and nice view can come with friends couples and familiy||July 2, 2017

Natasha T||50||Passing by as the weather allowed it. Many people around on bikes, on the grass and everywhere. Concert going on this weekend..... Fun to be around and to walk through....||July 1, 2017
Pascal J||50||This is one of the most beautiful Park I have seen, very clean and lots of squirrels for the kids to play around. There are some coffee corners with London prices but good quality. There is a lake with rental boats small as well. Go with the kids relax and enjoy. ||July 1, 2017
EmmJehy||40||Very popular park, but with plenty of space to absorb the hoards. Particularly at night time, there are lots of hideaways for frisky couples...if that's your thing. In the daytime it isn't remotely seedy. It's ideal location provides a perfect escape to many weary travellers. Lovely walking spot.||July 1, 2017
shutter51||50||Having the habit of a walk before breakfast I discovered Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens on a previous visit. I intentionally sought accommodation within walking distance so I could see the Rose Garden in full bloom. They have lost none of their magic. The household cavalry riding in formation but not in full dress uniform beside the Serpentine. Some mornings a hint of mist over the water or members of the Serpentine Swimming Club doing their laps. Grey squirrels scampering through the grass and up the trees. The flower walk near the Albert Memorial. The Peter Pan statue. All pure heaven. I can't think of any more to say about such a special place.||July 1, 2017
BigMushy||50||I had a run round the Serpentine before breakfast so I got to see a lot of the park and I have to say it made me feel quite envious of Londoners having such great access to this and the adjoining Green Park and St.James's Park. It's a "3 for the price of 1" bonanza. You lucky things. There's so much to take in with all the people and wildlife. Highly recommended||July 1, 2017
cjlb1234||50||I love Hyde park, not only is it my favourite running park it's a great walk or cut through park. The serpentine is beautiful in the summer with the pedalos and it has a very nice cafe that do nice snacks, light bites and drinks (it does get very busy) As a runner it's a lovely park to run in, open and clean. ||July 1, 2017
davethedrill||50||London is so blessed to have this magnificent park in its city centreSo tranquil Ideal for walking,sightseeing,picnics and gigs||July 1, 2017
Scott B||50||We stayed a couple of blocks from Hyde Park, and spent a lot of time wondering through it and Kensington Garden. Beautiful trees, open areas, ponds, and pathways to either get across the park or just meander for a while. Very dog and family friendly, with lots of families having picnics. Wild parrots were a highlight||July 1, 2017
655adrienner||50||We walked through this park on our second day in London and were absolutely in awe of the beautiful sweet smelling meadows, fantastic Italian watergardens and plethora of amazing old trees and plants.It was even more wonderful to see the beautiful memorial statues and so many people out enjoying this treasure, including Kensington Palace grounds and the pond filled with swans. Paradise in London.||July 1, 2017
laterstarter||50||We booked hotels near to Hyde Park. It has excellent walk paths and grassy areas for relaxation or exercise. We were in London during some hot days (for the UK) and the water areas were very well used for cooling down by Londoners. It was a pity Lancaster Gate tube station was closed for repairs during our visit as it was very close to our hotel. ||July 1, 2017
EmmyL204||50||Hyde park is huge. It is a perfect place to go for a run or just to escape the city life and enjoy nature. ||July 1, 2017

Cheers142||50||The park is beautiful and wandering through the park we saw a lot of activities.The Serpentine lake was full of people sitting by the shores.Saw a few boats being rowed in the lake. Good place to picnic as well. Will come again ||July 1, 2017
Mark4x||50||Really enjoyed walking through and just getting lost in my own world. It's clean and offers lots of spots for a picnic. Wouldn't mind spending time here any chance I get. ||June 30, 2017
Justin F||50||For those that enjoy nature, peace and some walking - this is the place to be. So many birds, trees and various gardens and statues. Really well taken care of. We walked through the park a couple times since it was so big.||June 30, 2017
geoch1||40||Great park to walk around and, having small kids, seeing squirrels very near you!They come to you and you can feed them.||June 30, 2017
Mathi2099||50||I enjoyed a long walk with a friend in Hyde Park. We particularly appreciated the diversity of plants and trees, observing the numerous squirrels and birds and also the accessibility of the Park (being near Oxford Street and Buckingham Palace). A great idea to get some fresh air in London!||June 30, 2017
janine m||50||loved this park took a bike ride round it lots of things going on clean and well thought of for bike riders. would defo recomend.||June 30, 2017
KevinSadler2364||50||Hard to imagine that anywhere in central London can be tranquil, but if anywhere is, then it's Hyde Park.Much of this vast expanse is grass, ideal for a game of something, running, or just lazing around, but there is more to it than that.||June 30, 2017
venthamward||40||nice day to hang out in hyde park, what a beautiful fountain they have. My girlfriend and i will definitely be visiting again||June 30, 2017
JRBrookes||40||One a recent hot Saturday I was faced with this daunting combination:1. a stressed out teenage daughter studying for exams;2. her mother, who had been dealing with the stressed out daughter all week and needed a break;3. an overheated and overcrowded city;4. a very limited budget; and5. nothing planned in advance.When I was then faced with the joint cry of "can't you please take her/me out and do something for a few hours. I'm going crazy!", I had to come up with something fast.Realising that a bit of gentle manipulation might be required to come up with something that wouldn't be rejected right away, I said to my daughter, "this weather reminds me of our visits to Hyde Park when you were little". To my relief and astonishment, my daughter 's reply was "I loved those visits", so when I then suggested having a picnic in Hyde Park, we were up and out the door within minutes.Having raised such happy nostalgic memories, I hoped the day would not disappoint. But I had forgotten what a truly special place Hyde Park can be.And on that hot Saturday afternoon we were reminded that sometimes we need to slow down, relax and enjoy the simple pleasure of a day in the park. We took our picnic and found two lounge chairs near the water. We snacked and talked and laughed together. Then we read our books and closed our eyes for a quick happy nap. When we woke up, we took a walk through the park and visited some of our favourite spots from past visits. We watched children playing in the Diana Memorial Fountain, found the "big scary horse" statue that used to seem so spooky and then stopped at the Albert Memorial - and talked about the "sad queen who lost her prince".And we got to see other happy people enjoying the big green treasure chest that is Hyde Park as they walked, or sat, or played or slept in the spot they had found in the park. After a few hours had passed, and the afternoon was ending. my happy and relaxed daughter gave me a hug and said "this was a perfect afternoon." Which was the best part of my day.As we made our way home from our perfect afternoon, we talked about what we might do the following weekend. After talking about a few ideas, my daughter said "can we just go back to Hyde Park again" and I couldn't think of a better idea than the chance to remember to slow down, relax and enjoy this London treat again. ||June 29, 2017
Helen M||50||Hyde park is the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of a very busy city. So many wonderful points of interest ... something for everyone. ||June 29, 2017
JTokar||50||Hyde Park is one of several parks within the City of London and it is delightful to walk through in the early morning or early evening. In the early morning the birds are singing and the dew is on the grass as London awakens around you.||June 29, 2017

R_Cambs||50||A friend and I popped in for a spontaneous lunch. We found a lovely cafe (Tennis and Sports Centre Cafe) at Hyde Park to enjoy the sunshine. There was a lovely atmosphere, and lots of benches to sit outside. Whether you are there to participate in sports or not, it's definitely a lovely place for a pit stop. They have a range of lunch options and so much cake (inc. gluten free).||June 28, 2017
Ralmutawa||40||Beautiful place to be with friends or family. Adults or kids. The lake is beautiful. My only comment would be not enough places to get something to eat or drink.||June 28, 2017
Ceyda C||50||Love coming here when i'm free, in need of of a jogg or just do some reading when the sun is out. The park is surrounded by many great historical sights. Pretty much close to everything. If you enjoy a stroll then you'll love this park.||June 28, 2017

EmmaMH19||50||Hyde Park is always amazing for walks, and lots of friendly dog walkers etc. You can also use the Santander bikes to have a bike ride in the designated cycle parks, which is lovely. The lake is gorgeous and this is definitely worth a visit, especially if you love walking! ||June 28, 2017
Sus1952||50||I thoroughly enjoyed walking through Hyde Park in the rain yesterday. The roadway was closed to traffic because of the stages being put up for concerts which made it even better as there was no traffic. It is just such a perfect oasis in the middle of London. ||June 28, 2017
ivanniah||50||Phew! Walking and walking! We walked so much. The park is beautiful. I loved the lake in the center and the rose gardens. We even got to see a rainbow after a quick shower over the lake. We walked all the way to end of the park and enjoyed every bit of it. Remember to always carry an umbrella, you never know when it will sprinkle. The park has lots and lots of maps, so don't be intimidated by the size. It is huge! ||June 27, 2017
Sushkin||50||We had planned a visit to one of London's many museums or galleries, but as the weather was so lovely we couldn't bear to be indoors. Hyde Park is just beautiful, and full of birds and wildlife. It's just the perfect place for a leisurely stroll, or a run for the more energetic! A great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. Interestingly Hyde Park seems to be much better looked after than the neighbouring Kensington Gardens, although they are lovely too. Have a walk right round the Serpentine if you have time. ||June 27, 2017
gail m||50||Lovely big park...bikes available to hire at entrance...I was staying in a hotel on Kensington side and was able to walk through the park to Buckingham palace...lovely big lake with swans and ducks...||June 27, 2017
Yvonne T||50||Undeniably one of the best parks in London, ideal for picnics especially when the weather has been so warm lately. I could spend my whole day there and not get bored||June 27, 2017
126mohammadn||50||the Hyde park is considered very big with respect to the open spaces in London i enjoyed having a walk in the park in addition to riding those small boats in the pond. the pond is also huge with the ability to see closely the different types of ducks available. the landscape is also amazing mostly recommended to visit in a weather where the sun is shining where you can find people having a lunch break as a picnic or even cycling or tanning in this beautiful landscape.||June 27, 2017
marilyne2375||30||Fresh breath of air in the middle of a major city. Good walking experience incorporating nature. Has a feel good factor.||June 27, 2017
lukeg630||40||If you don't know it, well, it's huge, sprawling and both relaxing and interesting. And historic and quintessentially London. It's like a city's big lung. You'd need many days to cover it even in part. Get a map, get some local food and picnic, or stroll around and marvel at the 192 different cultures you see picnicking or laughing and tune in to the 192 languages you'll hear. There are lakes, ponds, beautiful buildings, landscaped parklands, gardens and monuments -a few of which perform at the occasional summer rock concerts. And there's unmissable Speakers Corner. And lots of fresh air. Add to which it's well and safely run by the Royal Parks Police and probably had been, in some form or other, since 1536 when Henry VIII commissioned it as somewhere to hunt. I'd suggest you follow his lead and forage around - you haven't seen London until you have spent some quality time here. ||June 27, 2017
Nadine T||50||Our hotel was just across the street from Hyde Park, and it is a beautiful park. We walked for hours and still couldn't see even a small portion of it. We loved the huge parakeets that were there.||June 26, 2017
Werner H||40||A must see location, here you feel London is not only noisy cars and traffic. Hyde-park is large and impressive. We ran through and around it. Must see location||June 26, 2017
mikesY8092LR||40||Walked a large part of the park and it is a lot bigger than you would expect. Suffering a bit as the weather has been so dry recently but still nice to see such a large open space in the middle of a big city. Didn't have time to mess Bout in the Serpentine but looked very inviting. Slightly spoiled by the hoarding erected for the upcoming music events.||June 26, 2017
haktus||40||We enjoyed moments walking in this park and enjoyed its atmosphere not only this but almost in all seasons.||June 26, 2017
Maytwentytvelve T||50||Impressive outdoor space in the middle of the city. Another great family activity at little to no cost. If you love trees, grass, picnics, ponds, swans, ducks, you'll appreciate it. Diana's Memorial Fountain is there too.||June 26, 2017
newda02||50||Luckily we had some fantastic weather when we recently visited London and thought why not a stroll in the Park. Fantastic. What a beautiful stretch of parkland in the middle of a huge bustling city to enjoy on a warm spring/summers day. Spend some time by the lake with the bird life, tea at the baths cafe, or just plain wondering around!||June 26, 2017
ferdief2015||40||Its a huge park, good place to rest, do brisk walking, enjoy talking a and long chat with friends. Some parts are close depending if there are events.||June 25, 2017
AbbyLove||50||Hyde Park is a must-see when you visit London. Inside the Park is the Kensington Palace, the Princess Diana Memorial Gardens, a Peter Pan statue, and several other wonderful statues. Dogs can roam free. If you walk through the park to the other side, you will come out across the street from the museums. It takes about an hour or more to walk all through the park, but on a nice cool day, it's worth it. ||June 25, 2017
JennyTravel123||50||This is a beautiful sprawling park. We enjoyed walking in it and taking the paddle boats out. There are public restrooms scattered around the space, but just make sure you have some change for them!||June 25, 2017
Zaid S||50||Love visiting here with friends and family. Very scenic and spacious. It is what you make it so make sure you have a plan ||June 25, 2017
pastalinder||20||I don't know if I just didn't do my homework, but I was expecting so much more in terms of floral and plant species and gardens. We walked almost the entire length. Most of the park was preparing for a huge concert series so all the stages, fencing, lighting, etc filled the bulk of the area. The large expanses of lawn were just that...just grass that was dry. Along the 'river' it was a bit improved. But I'd say big cities such as NYC, Boston, SF far outdo this one in beauty and diversity.||June 25, 2017
julianquentin||50||Great place on a sunny day. Good just to walk around, or for a row on the Serpentine. Lady Diana Kids' Playground is a hit with my 6 year old.||June 25, 2017

J150505||50||We visited Hyde Park yesterday. We walked more or less all the way round and estimate that we must have covered about three miles. Our walk was interesting as it included the path around the Serpentine lake and some formal gardens with a delightful range of interesting plants. We stopped at the Lido Cafe on the edge of the Serpentine for refreshments and a spot of people watching. Two Cortado coffees came to £5.40 - they had a good flavour, were very hot and came in large glasses. We would definitely recommend this popular cafe but it must get very busy at weekends and school holidays.||June 24, 2017
Doron E||50||Beautiful and quiet, just off the main busy streets of the city. Perfect for a nice romantic walk around the pond.||June 24, 2017

mrsagf||50||London's key roundabout, where at least five major streets intersect. In an astonishing concentration, six war memorials stand on this one small traffic island:1) Wellington Arch--an1820's triumphal arch to celebrate the Duke of Wellington's defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. Meant as a gateway to Buckingham Palace, but later traffic planners had other ideas.2) Wellington statue--an 1888 equestrian statue of the Duke cast from French cannons captured at Waterloo. Faces his home, Apsley House.3) Royal Artillery Memorial--a 1925 stone howitzer with bronze artillerymen, one depicted as dead.4) Machine Gun Corps Memorial--a 1925 David, with the sword of Goliath.5) Australian War Memorial--a 2003 curved wall of Australian granite, carved with thousands of names of towns in which solders were born and the names of 47 battle sites.6) New Zealand War Memorial--a 2006 set of 16 cross-shaped bronze girders inscribed with NZ symbols. One company of ten men, six stars of the Southern Cross.||June 22, 2017
Antchad||50||I enjoyed exercising in Hyde Park. It also has a wonderful lake with lots of bird life such as herons, swans and geese which I thoroughly enjoyed!||June 22, 2017
David S||40||A very large park surrounded by the boroughs of London. Kennsington palace is on the west side, a couple lakes, bike paths, running paths, and even a horse path. An oasis in the middle of the city. I was told it was the old hunting grounds for Kennsington palace. If you need nature in the city, here it is. ||June 22, 2017
KittyB123||40||This was a nice place to visit and walk around. We had lovely food. We would definitely go back there for another visit.||June 22, 2017
xlavayukix||50||I came here on a nice summers day when it was roasting hot and I was dying in the heat. Hence the park was very crowded at the height of the tourist season, but since it's pretty massive in size, it's very enjoyable regardless of the people. They had free beach chains all around the lake area for people to use, and there was also a few nice places for food and coffee, and also afternoon tea. Near the Hyde Park corner underground entrance, there is a lovely rose garden as well as a bike rental area, and the park has a few cycle paths too. Buckingham Palace is nearby, so one can easily go from Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park ,Kensington gardens and the palace all in a day, although it would be quite a bit of walking if you're not prepared.It takes about 20-30 mins walk to get from the entrance at Hyde Park station to Kensington gardens which I highly recommend plus the walk through the park is lovely. You can rent boats near the lake area as well. At the time I went, there was a big food market going on near Kensington palace (mid-June) which smelled nice but you have to pay to get in. Overall, beautiful and extremely large park which is also the location for events and concerts.||June 22, 2017
pk1363||40||This park is surrounded by the city. To the east is the US Embassy, to the west is Kensington Palace. Harrods is a bit south and Paddington is to the north. This park is well maintained, surrounded by a high wall and wide open within the walls. There is a carousel, several restaurants, lakes, trees,and on sunny days (I know... London!) lots of people soaking up the sun. There are no motorized vehicles and the bikes and pedestrians get well.||June 22, 2017
Shelly H||50||By far the highlight for our kids (15 and 12) - Winter wonderland takes over in Dec and part of Jan where Hyde park is transformed into an amusement park with tons of rides, games, food, etc. They offer tickets to purchase ahead of time to reserve for: ice skating, tour of ice sculptures (really fun but super chilly - zero degrees F) and shows.||June 22, 2017
Barbra S||50||A pretty reprieve in the middle of the city - the highlight was seeing and hearing the people at the Speakers Corner... a part of history not to be missed. ||June 22, 2017
Clivel_98||50||Although London is a large metropolitan area, it does have a wealth of green spaces through its many parks and open spaces. Hyde park is one of these, surrounded by a variety of monuments and statues and with the Serpentine lake in it.||June 22, 2017
soulanna_BC||50||such a great park! great walks or picnic place, so much to see, also can be nice and scenic way to get to Oxford street||June 22, 2017
LeeC602||50||Lovely relaxing place in the summer, very quite considering you are in central London. Deck chairs, ice cream really nice place to be.||June 21, 2017
Cristian L||50||Name something great from London... "Parks" for sure needs to be on mind. This giant park is amazing. You can stay there for a picnic or to spend some time... to walk... to run... whatever you want.||June 21, 2017
KAS57||50||Our hotel was 2 short blocks from Hyde Park, so we crossed it multiple times during our visit. The sun had finally came out and Londoners were enjoying the Royal Park. Cyclists, dogs, horseback riders were all enjoying the peace. So much better than trudging down a busy street.||June 21, 2017
Baker_Bowie||40||There are lots of things to do and see in the park with plenty of other sights nearby. Its very lovely in springtime with the green grass and flowers.||June 21, 2017
Bryan G||50||Nice afternoon walk to Hyde Park to meet up with our son & family. First we saw the Diana Memorial which was very peaceful and then we sat next to the Serpentine looking at all the wildlife on display especially ducks, geese, swans and a grey heron who wasn't put off by the public gazing at him / her. It wasn't busy and there were tea rooms available but we were rushed for time. Just enough for a family photo really||June 21, 2017
Stanley C||50||We walked around the entire park. There were many interesting examples of sculpture, art and various attractions (including facilities for kids). There were also interesting historical buildings, rare trees and plants, plus the water features including the Serpentine - a huge lake with boats for hire. A thoroughly enjoyable day. ||June 21, 2017
41susanar||40||Very beautiful and so peaceful.Realy enjoyed walking around for a bit, sit down while having an ice cream.Agood place to rest a bit before returning to our walking tours around London.||June 21, 2017
icosmosenterprise||50||This is a simple park, but it's huge and with a nice location. It has a lot of trees and some open space. Located beside the lake, we see many cute geese, ducks and birds. Nice for jogging and nice stroll.||June 21, 2017
RhondaRaf||50||London has many parks and our favorite was Hyde Park. It has beautiful fountains and ponds and flowers. ||June 21, 2017
MeM543||50||Beautiful park where you can see everything from nature, to rowing boats and seeing people riding horses Excellent place to relax||June 21, 2017
xojanie||50||We always enjoy going to Speakers Corner on Sunday mornings and listening to citizens pontificate their views. My grandchildren learned what "standing on a soap box" meant.||June 21, 2017
Bill B||50||This park is very popular with the locals and was busy each time we visited. There is little wonder why one you enter the park as it is surprisingly quiet. This is a great place for a small lunch or just a place to walk away from the tourist crowds.||June 20, 2017
TXMARTINS||50||A wonderful place to relax from walking all over town with a great book in hand, this is one of the best parks in London full of so many places to visit, see, and take in daily London life full of locals and English traditions. You will see all types of sports being played, bikers abound, and great coffee shops are located on the corners. With some fun activities of kids like a carousel this is a great place to escape for all ages or hide under a tree on a hot day.||June 20, 2017
DaveT497||50||Didnt expect the park to be this big in London and there are some excellent landmarks and wildlife to see in addition to the coffee stops and food areas. We walked through the park every day during our 3 day visit and managed to take different routes each time to see something different. Look for the parakeets that land on you if you tempt them.||June 20, 2017
jonesemi||50||Hyde Park was the center of our London experience. We started with a sunny nap waiting for our room to be ready after a red eye from the states. We also took our friends dog here for fetch and a picnic - such a great timeout from the city.||June 20, 2017
LordSnotty61||50||I'm a Londoner and I find Hyde Park an excellent place to relax and unwind and get away from the crowds and noise off the city. I would say it has got something for everyone. Plenty of facilities for children. Don't expect acres of flowers, it's not that kind of park! There's plenty of shade on a hot day, plenty of refreshment vendors and water fountains.I love the Serpentine, and enjoy taking a pedalo or rowing boat out there. There's even a lido. The person who commented that there are not many trees needs to get a white stick and a guide dog.||June 20, 2017
CarolineLupo||50||We strolled around for about an hour and a half - was absolutely lovely with gentle walking paths very removed from the streets. The Diana Fountain as well as Kensington Palace were both highlights. Watch out, there is a horse path as well!||June 20, 2017
CliftonVA||50||Sunshine and blue skies are always a welcomed sight in London. Hyde Park is a beautiful spot to stroll, people watch and just commune with nature at its finest. Geese, birds, chipmunks and squirrels scamper as the breeze blows through shade trees. Benches to sit and watch the world go by are available and this is a beautiful spot to stretch out on the grass and enjoy the day.||June 19, 2017
_F7312GU||50||A giant park in the center of London. With lakes, fountains in it. Nice place for a family walk, for a picnic. ||June 19, 2017
PICKYTRAVELOR1||50||Very big with lots of statues and ponds. Pretty to walk through or picnic or ride a bike. Don't miss the Peter Pan stature or Prince Albert Memorial||June 19, 2017
bettyemixon||50||Beautiful, peaceful, and interesting. The gardens of flowers are very pretty, but it is the wooded paths that are the most calming and restful. Ranger's Lodge was worth viewing for the architecture. Don't miss Kensington Palace as well.||June 19, 2017
WhyteLight||50||Hype park is a really big and lush space it connects to another park which has the serpentine river running through it, a great place to just go and chill out in.||June 19, 2017
Rafikosanali||50||Listen to music in your headphone or read a novel. Such a beautiful place to relax. next to the Palace||June 19, 2017
Joni S||40||Well known huge park inside London. We visited in an hot saturday in June when the park was busy with lots of people. Rose garden has lots of different roses and was actually one of the less crowded areas. The serpentine was beautiful, but at the time of our visit very crowded.||June 19, 2017
JelieBaby||50||This wonderful London park is arguably the best in the capital, if not the entire UK. It's large, beautifully groomed and offers something for everyone – whether you want to row a boat on the Serpentine lake, swim outdoors in a lido, trot through the greenery on horseback, play tennis on a series of well-kept courts, birdwatch, have an al-fresco lunch, visit Speakers' Corner, pay tribute to the late Princess Diana at her memorial, pop into a palace, or simply catch a few rays on a deckchair while eating freshly whipped ice-cream.Hyde Park is also a great concert venue – and I've been fortunate to see both the Rolling Stones and Stevie Wonder perform here over the years. This sprawling park spans an enormous and varied 350 acres and is located in the heart of central London, a stone's throw from Oxford Street, Knightsbridge (home to Harrods) and Kensington. It's easily accessible by multiple buses and tube lines.It is simply my favourite place to be – and I was born and raised in London. I have travelled the globe and I've yet to find anywhere better! It is simply a sublime, must-visit location for tourists and locals alike.||June 19, 2017
jetalcott||50||This is a wonderful park. If you seek beauty, interaction with nature and close proximity to the heart of London, then Hyde Park is a winner.||June 18, 2017
Kees G||30||We were not impressed. The park has mostly lawns and a few trees lines. Not the beautifully landscaped park we expected. Not a place to go to if your time is limited.||June 18, 2017
sharalan||50||Lots of shady trees to sit under, just a lovely way to relax and enjoy the day. The gardens are lovely and the waterways are so full of bird life that it is a pleasure to just sit and take it all in. Perfect for a picnic.||June 18, 2017
Henry J||40||Went round the rose garden which provides lots of different flowers. Then went on to The Serpentine which was also nice and relaxing. On a hot sunny day in London can't beat going here||June 18, 2017
Stephanie T||50||The gardens were beautiful (it was early June). There were restrooms (20p admission). There were restaurants. It was great.||June 18, 2017
Kate85105||50||Gorgeous park. Immaculately clean and maintained. It is so big you could easily get lost but there is signage everywhere that helps a lot. The speakers corner was fascinating listening to people have their say on all sort of matters. A heated debate started which added to the entertainment. This park is suitable for all ages and people from all walks of life. A must visit while you are in London.||June 18, 2017
Liza D||50||The maps are deceiving, but not in a bad way.Unless you absolutely have to be somewhere, don't rush thru this park. You can realistically walk from Lancaster Gate to Royal Albert Hall or The Marble Arch to Wellington Arch & Buckingham Palace in less time than it takes to ride The Tube or take a bus, but then you miss what's on either side of you.There are "main" walkways, but it's the little "where does this path go?" that can lead to something else. Feeding the birds, sitting by the water or taking a pedal boat on the Serpentine can make for a leisurely time. The Italian Gardens near N Carriage Dr is a lovely spot to sit & eat some ice cream bought from modified Phantom II Rolls Royce.The Diana Memorial Fountain, which is more of a circling stream than an actual fountain, has a calming effect, despite having children playing in it while I was there. Don't forget Speaker's Corner on Sundays. I only saw a few people & thought it was limited to specific times, but when I came back later in the day, new people were there. Agree? Don't agree? Speak up! Not only are the people there to say what's on their mind, they are willing to debate with you! Just as much as it can be a spectator sport, it can be interactive if you wish to get involved. Bikes are available for hire, but you are limited to which roads you can ride on within the park, as the paths are mostly for walking or running. The walkways are flat & some directions are clearer than others. Just make note of which statue or structure you've passed or the view of a building over the treetops, you might need them as a marker that you've "already gone that way"||June 18, 2017
djohn02||50||Loved the beauty of Hyde Park. In fact, I would come back just to spend more time in the parks of London! Hyde Park contained beautiful views and I wish I had more time to bike, boat and be one of those who just spent the day relaxing on the lawns. Don't skimp on your time to relax in the parks like a true Londoner. ||June 18, 2017
jodjanaj||50||Excellent views and nice place to relax, plenty of open space and it's safe. We can also see duck and swan in the small river and also lots of jogging place. The only problem is pups every where, especially from the ducks and swans, so watch out your steps||June 18, 2017
CoolMomTraveler||50||Took a strategic stroll through to see the Diane fountain, swans and Italian garden. This is such a beautiful park, I'd say no nature lover should miss it. There were mother swans with babies which was a special treat. There are some toilet facilities in this park which is helpful. ||June 18, 2017
Often_disappointed||50||Most people are amazed by just how big the park is, with roads, bridges, lakes, horsetrails, footpaths etc. There is plenty of wildlife, including non-indigenous Green Parrots that now flock around with the pigeons when people are feeding them. Lots of little buildings and interesting sculptures including the Peter Pan statue on the west side of the Serpentine just north of the bridge.Great place to escape the noise and insanity of London for an hour or so.||June 17, 2017
ianwebb75||50||Hyde park is a great place to just casually stroll around or be more active. Numerous sculptures and areas make this park one of the better parks in the world. ||June 17, 2017
Milesandmiles2||50||Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are both beautiful parks. We were staying right next to Hyde Park and rather than use the tube, walked across the park to Hyde Park Corner and Victoria one day, and Kesington High Street the other day. Much better than taking the tube. Due to glorious sunny weather , the deckchairs were out along with ice cream vans and the cafes were open.So much to see, you could spend much of the day here. There is a Lido and lake area for swimming . The cafe at the Lido is reasonably priced.We walked along the serpentine and then through the Rose Garden which was stunning. Beautiful colours and scent from the flowers.Plenty of benches to rest and lots of grass for picnics. Definitely visit if you get the chance.||June 17, 2017
MULCASTER2||50||You just must walk around this park, if your lucky enough possibly have a sit down and watch all the people go by. Lots to do and see but make sure you find the squirrels - they will eat out of your hands! Brilliant open space with the hustle all around just adds to the magic||June 17, 2017

Mark D||50||The park was established a "mere 481" years ago and its 1,500,000 sq ft were once a part of Westminster Abbey!! It is very well known for its "speakers' corner" where on Sunday mornings- for the past 142 years- people come to "speak their minds"! Its bandstand is the oldest in the UK.The park adjoins Kensington Gardens.This iconic park is a definite must see!||June 16, 2017

lovetotravelHetalk||50||As a visitor to London one musttt have an evening / morning free to just do nothing but lay in Hyde Park. Just the views and the peace around gets this place a plus! Ladies , head to marble arch , shop to your hearts content , buy a takeaway meal from M & S and come and lay at Hyde Park. :) ||June 16, 2017

JudyS37||50||Visited here early on Wednesday morning with my daughter. We walked round the Serpentine . It was very beautiful with lots of wild life including a very tame squirrel. We saw a helicopter take off in a field also. There were people swimming in the lido and peddle boats to hire. We ate at a cafe on the side of the lake .Gardens were very well kept.||June 15, 2017
Aksar M||50||If looking for a relaxing walk Hyde Park is perfect it is one of the best and biggest parks in London lots to do from boating on the lake to finding out more about local history a lot available to read. Or you can go to speakers corner to listen to a variety of debates and get involved one of my favourite pastime. There are a lot of tourists visitors as it is a tourist attraction on its own and a lot of tourists attractions very nearby also Oxford Street and surrounding areas for shopping. You can easily spend a day just exploring there's something for everyone here. Would highly recommend it to anyone visiting London to get a truly unique London experience. ||June 15, 2017

sahar333||20||It's a huge park, but doesn't have anything special for visiting! It may be good for families with kids and also for locals to spend the weekend and for picnic||June 15, 2017
BigDez33||50||If you go here on CavMem day you will be able to see lots of fine 'Gentlemen' dressed very smartly commemorating the Cavalry Memorial.

AllanKPB||50||London is great. But for some of us smaller town folk, we need a break from the bustle of life. Great cities have great parks. Hyde Park is great and fits the bill for a chill out. Go for a walk, smell the flowers, watch the birds, or have a beer. An amazing park. Went every morning for a jog and walk. A must. ||June 14, 2017
Mark G||50||This park is amazing, lots of space, lots of people but not too many, lots of dogs. Wish i had our dog with us as this is the perfect place to take her off leash. We walked through this park several times to the tube, and it made the walk enjoyable.||June 14, 2017
Bhavin-joshi||50||HUGE!!! Awesome green lung in the city. Serpentine lake (read boating) is fun. The rose garden is amazingly beautiful and smells good from a distance.||June 13, 2017
Hencasdj||50||And find a spot, watch the world go by.You don't really hear the hussle and bustle of London. It's a little piece of tranquillity, specially if you go down by the river to the right of the boat hire/ice cream parlour. Watch the boats rowing and hear the horses trotting past.Look out for the gardeners/keepers cottages beautiful.There's plenty of space to feel alone in a very popular, busy park.Kick back and relax before the hustle of London takes over again.Pop a Cork, lay back and enjoy.||June 13, 2017

Esme B||50||Took a leisurely walk here on a Sunday to see The Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Walk, where there is a horizontal kind of fountain with water cascading down from a point at the top on each side, with different 'effects of bubbling water' on the way down. Brilliant for children playing & splashing in it or dipping your feet. Thought there could have been a statue of Diana in the centre grass area. The lake is lovely with lots of swans & ducks & there is a van selling whippy ice creams where you can sit & enjoy at the lake edge. Free toilets there too.||June 13, 2017
Jess U||50||Most beautiful park I've ever been too. Wish I had know how great it was before I went so I could have allotted more time there ||June 13, 2017
N1250KXannec||50||A great place to stroll and take in the vibrant energy of Londoners and other tourists. There is a nice cafe for a beverage and a snack which seems to turn over quickly enough, so it's worth waiting for a table.||June 13, 2017
eraestua||50||London is crowded and busy. I enjoyed this large park to get some space. Had tea overlooking the Italian gardens. Very relaxing. ||June 13, 2017
RLMartin||40||Hyde Park is huge. They have a wonder flower garden. The Serpentine Lake is full of lots of swans with babies and geese and ducks of all kinds. They ride horses there. There's the Diana Memorial fountain to visit. At the east end, is Kensington Palace which has a wonderful sunken garden with ivy covered walkways. It's just a pleasant place to hang out in the middle of the city.||June 13, 2017

susamc||50||Hyde Park offers a tranquiltiy to the weary traveler and the local folks. The entire park is restful and uplifiting. I was there at a time London and England were experiencing sadness and unrest. This park offered solace to anyone entering it.

Marcelinhakpy||40||The Hyde Park is a nice chill place, most recommended in Sunny days.It is a nice break from the whole heavy city tourism, a nice way to see Londoners life.During the summer, the park holds several concerts and attractions, which are fun.The park is very big, so you can hire a city bike to go around it (main roads only) and try to find some hidden corners, as the flowers section.Kensington palace is located at the west end of the park.||June 12, 2017
Metropolitan_Man||50||Huge Park, lots to see and do. Lots of space even though in Central London. Probably the best park in London, on a par with Greenwich Park:)||June 12, 2017

31cassandrac||50||This park is huge and so amazingly beautiful. Twice we walked through to discover new things. There's the palace of course but also a Peter Pan statue that talks to you through a QR code, there are beautiful birds and even parakeets that are wild but will totally land on you for a pet. The Princess Diana fountain is peaceful and lovely. There are also several tube stations near the park on all sides||June 12, 2017
adrianloh||50||Apart from just strolling and admiring the greenery, there are myriad things to do at Hyde Park. As visitors from Singapore, we took our kids to the playground where they easily spent an hour climbing, swinging and doing all sorts of things that kids love to do in the playground. We also walked by the Serpentine which is the big lake in the middle of Hyde Park. Unluckily (or luckily) we were on the other side of the boat rental place so we didn't have a chance to get out onto the lake. And yes our kids were disappointed!Being city dwellers, it was also nice to see the swans, coots, moorhens, geese, ducks and other types of birds all over the place, especially the cute and fluffy cygnets and goslings!||June 12, 2017
golfgal2||40||We were staying at a hotel on Park Lane and loved the close proximity to Hyde Park. We absolutely enjoyed the fragrant rose and flower gardens!! Just gorgeous. Weather was fantastic for an early evening stroll. Huge park to explore, walk, run, picnic, etc. Nice break from hustle and bustle of the city!||June 12, 2017
C9776EHmikek||50||A huge park with walkways, a large long river with boats and swans, walk by or take a bycicle, do a picnic and enjoy yourself||June 12, 2017
Kozwotsit||40||We spent an enjoyable hour walking through the park from Notting Hill to the Royal Albert Hall. It was pretty busy on the Sunday. It was nice to see the swans and geese in the Round Pond. There is currently a Night Market (street food) in the park, but you have to pay an entrance fee.||June 12, 2017
Kurt R||40||We where hiring bikes and went cykling in the park. Nice places to view, good places to stop and have something to eat, but strange difficult to have a beer! If THIS had been easier, the park would get a 5 star rate! :-) ||June 12, 2017
kirstytaylor76||40||We went to the Diana Memorial park, one of the best free play parks I've been to for kids. Be prepared to stay all day !!!||June 12, 2017
Clive T||40||We had not been here for some years. The park is immaculately looked after extremely well, very little litter. The cafe by the boating lake was very reasonably priced, speakers corner full, noisy and multi cultural, a must for all not just visitors, take a picnic, wonderful place. ||June 12, 2017
David T||40||Walking through Hyde park in the morning or evening is most pleasant n one can enjoy the greenery n the flora beauties Good for family outings n even picnic in the grass Convenience to underground stations||June 12, 2017
RichardA4305||50||It's one of the best place in the world just to walk around if you are alone or with someone and have some time in your hand. I went there with family and friends and also alone a lot of times and it always helped me relax. I just loved waking around alone and try to blend in with the nature there. I wish I get to come here more often on these little reflective walks which helps me a lot. You can also boat here for a while and relax your mind further. There is a cafe near the boating place. I was once grabbing a quick bite there and I got attached by a lot of birds and pigeons. They just came at the food without any fear and I had to walk away. Lol. I will post a picture here I took from the incident. Over all great place to be. ||June 11, 2017
Traveler06232009||40||Hyde Park is gorgeous. If you have the time when in London, take an hour or two just for a nice walk through the park. Lots to see.||June 11, 2017

BoothieG93||50||Hyde park in absolutely massive I couldn't believe this was in London and with the huge lake in the middle with pedalo's it's amazing in sunny weather. We rented the bikes which can be hard to find but are worth it or you'll need a whole day if planning to walk haha. Stopped for nice beer part way round it's a deffo must see!||June 11, 2017
BiniTravels||50||Hyde Park is fantastic for all ages. We love just walking around or having a picnic at the park. Our favorite spot is without a doubt the Princess Diana Memorial Playground. We could spend hours at that playground.||June 11, 2017

Cestovatel4||50||As a walking and a hiking loving family we did London on foot. Hyde Park was a highlight on a Sunday. This is the best place to relax in the middle of the busy city. Some of the surrounding roads remained crazy busy but as one walked deeper into the park it felt more like a small town with people sitting on benches reading. Londoners seem always on the go but on Sunday they relax and enjoy. They also love their pet dogs and I must say the dogs know how to behave with dignity. It was hilarious to watch. Loved walking through the various gardens with roses, kids playgrounds, etc. Negatives: 1) bathrooms. There were some, paid of course, but I would not venture in due to the outside odiferous entrance. 2) water fountains. This isn't a negative just something to keep in mind. There are a few drinking water fountains but not too many for a park this size. ||June 10, 2017
Matt_Hosken||50||Hyde Park is perhaps my favorite city park in all the world! It's such a serene escape any time of the day or year, but at dawn it's particularly peaceful and an excellent place for a morning run! I love Hyde Park so much, I left Heathrow on a 5-hour layover from Tel Aviv to LAX to go for a nice long walk in the park.||June 10, 2017
carolfromcalgary2017||50||This park is so diverse. There is a lake, a wonderful childrens' playground, Kensington Palace and miles of pathways, trees and beautiful flowers. The whole park is so well kept it is a joy to walk there.||June 10, 2017
GrahamP113||50||what a great place to get out of the hustle and bustle of the city. lovely walks ( careful of cyclists and Canadian geese) just relax and you could be in the countryside||June 10, 2017

Mark B||50||The vastness of this area which includes Kensington Palace, Princess Diana's Fountain, The Serpentine and numerous walking paths, gardens and grassland is staggering. A nice sunny day also added to the enjoyment. Would recommend this to anyone visiting London as it is very accessible.||June 9, 2017
Mark L||50||Everything from a beautiful lake to wonderful walking trials makes this park very special. We loved walking around the serpentine (lake).||June 9, 2017
lakeflyer||40||Hyde Park is much larger than I expected and was the perfect place to walk leisurely through. There are various statues and flower gardens tucked here and there. The Serpentine was full of fuzzy newly hatched geese and swans making their way to the water. The Princess Diana Memorial Fountain is here as well. It is a great place to escape from the city streets and refresh yourself while in London. ||June 9, 2017
urbandlegend||50||When ur from the other side of the world u hear about a lot of places, this was one in London.. we were lucky enough to stay across the road from the park ' went walking most morning. Great park for all activities when weather permitting. Loved the little squirrels that just come up to u.||June 9, 2017
Sharon V||50||Our hotel was located across the street from one of the entrances so we walked through the park on our way to the London points of interest. Was amazed at how green everything was and how nicely maintained the gardens and open grassy areas were. There are also many areas for bicycle riding if you don't want to walk. ||June 9, 2017
Melan5508||50||We had went to Hyde Park many places during different trips to London, but the last time that we went there was during Christmas and I have to say that the Winter Wonderland "park" was magical, it was a very beautiful experience.||June 9, 2017
Laurie62_12||50||This park was walking distance to where we stayed. It was a beautiful day when we arrived and we were jet lagged so we got some strong coffee and sat in the grass. A perfect place to get a run in each morning! Beautiful!||June 8, 2017
PennyScudamore||50||This is a huge area of parkland in which you can forget you're in a big city. Had a lovely stroll through avenues of very old trees, and a quiet sit down in the Rose Garden, which is very fragrant and rambling. The Serpentine is huge and there's lots of room to take pedaloes out on it. Aside from that there are vast areas where you can picnic, or play games, or exercise the dog. There are other attractions such as the Diana Memorial Garden, the Peter Pan statue, and the Serpentine Galleries - not that easy to find all these without a map, but there are some signposts. Big tip for foodies: the Serpentine Sackler Gallery (not the original gallery) has an amazing restaurant.||June 8, 2017
ludovic b||40||The park was a lovely place to relax and enjoy the scenery. There was many things to see. The park is very big so you can walk around for a very long time. ||June 7, 2017
heidi r||50||Make sure to check out Speakers Corner. A lot of history there. And check out Princess Diana Memorial Fountain.||June 7, 2017
PeachP633||40||We entered Hyde Park by the impressive Albert Memorial heading for Kensington Palace. It's a lovely place to walk with wide paths, gardens, trees and extensive lawns. Diana's reflecting pool memorial is a peaceful place to visit as is the serpentine lake. 500 years ago this was a forested area and used by the Monarchs for hunting deer.||June 7, 2017
632martinem||40||Walking around in Hyde Park is a must when you visit London. Quiet corners for reading a book, historical statues and a peek in the daily life of the busy Londoner||June 7, 2017
Suzanne P||50||My adult daughter and I are great birders, and between Hyde Park, Kensington Park (adjacent) and Regent's park we saw almost 70 species, right there in the middle of London. Be sure to bring an apple and you can feed the parrots (technically Ringed-neck Parakeets) that will fly right down from the trees and land on your arm or hand for apple pieces; my daughter was thrilled! Beautiful flowers, everything well-maintained and so much cleaner than any park in the US. Gorgeous swans and ducks. ||June 7, 2017
Maria H||40||We were staying just across from the park so walked through several times because the children loved it. There are fountains, waterfowl, Princess Diana's fountain where the children splashed about, Princess Diana's playground and several cafes.||June 7, 2017
raylol16||50||I love the parks in London but this one takes the cake for me. It was quite large and tons of things to see and do. It was very crowded when we visited since it was a sunny day. The park is so large you can find a spot to picnic or hang out with no problem. I was impressed with how clean and well kept all the parks were here and Hyde Park was no exception.||June 7, 2017
Beefnreef||50||One of the largest enclosed city parks in the world! Not the size of Phoenix park in Dublin but a great green room in the busy London! Love it||June 7, 2017
Nikki F||50||My kids loved feeding the swans and ducks at Hyde park. They keep asking to go back. It's a great place to walk around, it's so green!||June 6, 2017
Cindy B||40||I knew I wanted to go to see Hyde Park to see the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain which was well worth seeing but there was so much more in the park. Fantastic views including Kensington Palace. There was bike riding, dog walkers & everything in between. I'm not sure if it was officially in the park, but near Princess Di's Fountain there were paddle boats. There were plenty of gardens to be viewed. It is a vast park Imjust wish there was better signage throuh out it.||June 6, 2017
Anneli C||50||Hyde Park is a must see if you go to London. You can just wander and watch the runners and the couple's or the families all strolling along. We did pass the Diana Memorial Garden too and that looked lovely. Beautiful on a sunny day. ||June 6, 2017
gatsbysgirlHawaii||50||I have been to London many times, even staying for months at a time, but had never spent much time in Hyde Park. This most recent trip I remedied that oversite and was delighted I did. The Park is such a lovely retreat from the bustle of the big city. The upkeep is flawless, and the flowers, lakes, and birds are beautiful and breathtaking. I especially loved the Memorial Fountain for Princess Diana and was pleased to spend some time there remembering her sweet and gentle presence. We also enjoyed all the dogs being walked by their owners; none was off-leash and all were well-behaved. If I lived in London, I would go to Hyde Park every day to maintain my sanity!||June 6, 2017
hchambs||50||I've visited Hyde park many a time and keep finding new parts of the park that I haven't seen. Hire a pedalo on the lake, take a paddle in the Diana memorial fountain and I recently discovered the memorial garden at Kensington palace. ||June 6, 2017

Chris F||50||have attended many concerts here over the years and is always a pleasure. i enjoy the park throughout the year. walking through it makes you realise how spacious it is. benches all have stories behind them, and lots of interesting things to look at. Winter Wonderland around Christmas is always fun too.||June 4, 2017
DavidLT1993||50||Hyde Park is one of the places to see in London, whether you are running, walking, or just passing through, you can forget the hectic nature of London within the interior of the park. Lovely settings, and a wide variety of natural flora and fauna (including some kind of parakeet I think!) ||June 4, 2017
ajdial||30||One of the four royal gardens, Hyde park is a nice escape from the hustle of London. We were there on a very sunny day and it was packed. Only drawback to having so many visitors is the utter lack of rubbish bins. There was a disappointing amount of left behind trash in the park the following morning.||June 4, 2017
zenobia v||40||All that you see in English movies comes true when you set foot in the parks of London.. Hyde park, spread across vast acres provides a perfect place for a walk, while you take in the greenery you arrive at the lake swarmed with ducks.. while you continue your stroll across the park you can view the sprawling Kensington Palace and the Diana memorial..what I enjoyed the most was sitting with your feet in the running water of the fountain and basking in the sun while forgetting all your worries...||June 4, 2017
JackieFulham||50||Love Hyde Park, you can relax, walk, jog, boat ride, people watch or eat!Such an amazing space, I always feel very relaxed when I am here.||June 4, 2017
rime2009||50||What a beautiful place in the middle of the city. And huge! We were lucky enough to be here when the weather was warm and sunny, perfect weather for a stroll through Hyde Park.What impressed us was how clean it was. No garbage, no littering of any kind. I don't know if the park have people constantly working to keep it so tidy (we didn't see anybody), or that Londoners are more tidy than other people, either way it was a pleasure walking through the park.||June 4, 2017
machinmad||40||Went for a walk on a beautiful sunny day...plenty of space to stroke around one of the lakes, lots of ice-cream stops and room to enjoy this oasis in central London.TIP: buy your ice-cream from the mobile vendors away from the cafes as they are much cheaper!||June 4, 2017

charlottedelanoe||40||Hyde park is probably the most famous park in London but it is definitely not the the most beautiful!It is a lovely spot to have a drink along the lake or enjoy water attraction such as pedalo. If you don't have much time to visit London I would recommend Saint James Park. There are flowers and more birds species.||June 3, 2017
TTexasTom||50||Our perspective of Hyde Park was on a bike tour. It was obvious that those who choose to spend some time there were enjoying themselves and the beauty of the park. It is a peaceful and tranquil spot in the midst of London. Very refreshing!||June 3, 2017
Beeper53||50||Of all London's parks, this one gives the best feeling of a proper urban open space.Lots of water and key attractions dotted about as well as places to eat or get a drink. A great place to forget about your worries for a few hours.||June 3, 2017

Mark F||50||We were staying in the Victoria area so approached Hyde Park from Grosvenor Place. We were in the park twice during our visit and the first time we walked all the way through, heading North, and came out at Speakers Corner (Marble Arch). The second time, which was the best of the two visits, we again approached from Grosvenor Place but headed West in the park to Princess Diana's memorial garden. The Serpentine Lake was near so we went there for Coffee and watched all the swans and ducks. Later we saw the squirrels and if you have food, they will take it out of your hand :-)We spent more than two hours there on our second visit but if you took a picnic you could make a great day of it. ||June 3, 2017
Anand A||50||If you are in the city and have a love for walking - you must keep this park on the top of the list . The sprawling expense of green open spaces and the blue sky above in summer time will eVe you enthralled . The serpentine gallery located within this park and Lady Diana' memorial fountain all are here . A great place for families with kids , and on a sunny summer day the picnic is inviting . The squeals of delight of young children with sound of the cascading water within a fenced area are answer to safety of the young children with young parents . No entry fee . The are summer / winter timing for opening / closing . There is nice cafe if food needed . ||June 3, 2017
Sweet L||50||One of my absolute favourite places to visit whenever I'm in London. Love the wide space to walk around, the beauty of nature there, the tranquility of many spots away from the crowds, and the delicious creamy not icy soft 99 ice cream cones that you can buy from a Rolls Royce. Kids thoroughly enjoy feeding the ducks, swans, squirrels, etc. and running around the park. ||June 2, 2017
SpamueltheExplorer||50||It's a great park to take a long walk. Within this park is also Kensington Palace, which for a small admission fee, you can also walk and explore. We didn't want to pay for another admission fee to another Palace so we just walked around the park for about 3hrs. There are many things to see and do. You can rent a bicycle and peddle you way around the park. You can take a stroll next to a pond and see all the ducks and swans that reside in that park. You can also visit the Princess Diana Memorial that is located in the park as well. I recommend this park if you have nothing else to do in London. It's a great park just to wander around in and just be one with nature for a couple of hours. ||June 2, 2017
satyan_israni||50||It's a lovely sprawling park in the hear of London.. it has walking tracks, cycling tracks, roads and also a lovely lake called the serpentine. And tons and tons of greenery.. a beautiful place to simply get lost in your thoughts in the midst of nature.. no visit to London can ever be completed without a visit to Hyde Park.||June 2, 2017
Glen B||50||Hyde Park's reputation is right on target. I could have spent my whole week just walking around Hyde Park and looking at the statues, walkways, people, and birds. There is no doubt that the history behind Hyde Park makes it one of its outstanding attractions. Books and movies cannot do this wonderful park justice.||June 2, 2017
rubymoose||50||Hyde Park is enormous and incredible. Pristine, clean, shaded, vast green spaces, a big lake with paddle boats and beautiful birds. Was lovely just to walk through and enjoy. Awesome for dogs and kids!||June 2, 2017

MrMason9||50||We spent two full days in this park in May. Absolutely stunning weather made it a great place to be. We discovered these parakeets that would eat apples right out of your hand! And the squirrels would eat nuts out of your hand, too! Great little cafes all over the park, friendly people. The kids want to go back to London just to go back here.||June 2, 2017
ThePlumber2009||50||Highly recommended. It's hard to imagine the royalties walking this Park 300 years ago. It's so peaceful. You can see where the carriages drove through on the horse path. Hyde Park is a time capsule of time.||June 2, 2017
John M||50||If you want to get away from the hectic pace of London into some extensive peace and quiet this is well worth a stroll. Large and extensive with lots of space to enjoy nature. If you go to London a lot if time is spent dodging traffic and rushing around with the other millions in London but to make a visit here complete a visit around some tranquility in the centre of this great city is a must. I completely recommend a visit to this park is a must if you have the time. ||June 1, 2017
AJAB26||50||This place is huge, filled with nature and everything about this park is to love for. Spent long hours at this park and found my self lost in the beauty of nature.

futtock21||50||Together with Kensington Gardens adjoining it to the west Hyde Park is a massive open space in West London running from Park Lane in the east to Kensington and Notting Hill in the west at its centre the Serpentine ornamental lake. It was established by Henry VIII in 1536 as a royal hunting ground its prominent bent features include Speaker's Corner where any up-and-coming political windbag might hone his craft in the name of free speech and democracy; the memorial to the victims of the 7/7 London Bombings and the late Diana, Princess of Wales Water Trough which, rather line its dedicated, rarely functions properly.||June 1, 2017
Paul S||50||Tourist day - train to London with no time constraints just to take in some sites along the way... Made the mistake of going to the British Museum when actually wanted the Natural History museum... so ended up walking between the two and crossing Hyde Park along the way. Beautiful open space in direct contrast to the hustle and bustle surrounding the park - and just a great get away for anyone in the area. Clean with designated cycle routes (that people still walk in) and plenty of space for anyone to just sit and watch the world go by. Lots of food and drink choices along the way and just a supremely relaxing place to chill out. Go there!||June 1, 2017

mrsbsouthend||50||Wonderful afternoon at Hyde Park today. Weather was perfect for a trip to one of the loveliest of London's parks. There are several tube stops around the park but I got off at Hyde Park corner. There are maps dotted about (not as many as maybe I would like) so you can get a sense of the scale of the park. I took a walk taking in the 7/7 memorial (very simple but moving), a tea/cake stop at the Serpentine bar and café (very expensive - buy from the refreshment stands around the park, much cheaper), around the gorgeous serpentine and Diana, Princess of Wales fountain all the way to the Albert memorial which is in Kensington Gardens.It is a lovely park, keep an eye out for cyclists/rollerskaters, and you'll be fine. I saw large amounts of families and friends having a wonderful time, playing football, feeding the geese, going out of peddle boats. It's just such a great place to escape with your frazzled kids to get some fresh air. The traffic and pollution just seems to melt away when you are strolling. I loved the fact Diana's memorial fountain was full of kids having a fantastic time cooling down. If you take your kids bring spare clothes or something to dry them with as on a hot day it's a magnet ! In fact I'm sure I saw a few adults there too!! Close by are some nice clean public toilets - next to the very posh looking Lido restaurant. They are free and in good condition. Next to the restaurant is the Lido where you can actually swim in the serpentine if you want to. All in all a wonderful way to spend an afternoon, to break up sightseeing with a bit of a sit down or getting back to nature. Wonderful.||May 31, 2017

miguelatc||50||The Hyde park is huge and also one of the beautiful parks in London. You can walk, you can ride a bicycle, you can really relax and enjoy the environment. There is also a nice cafe where you can have something to eat or drink. When the weather is good, the Hyde park is definitely where we can chill and have some beers.||May 30, 2017

Pink P||30||Just a huge park in the middle of the west end. Not much in it. Mostly grass and pathways. Not much in the way of flowers or pretty landscaping. In the winter there's more mud than grass. I just think the City could do a lot more with it. It's huge so why not turn part of it into botanical gardens?||May 30, 2017

Sharon C||50||We spent about an hour in the park. It's a beautiful open space. It's great for being on wheels (rollerskates and scooters) as well a being really popular with runners. There is a nice kids park but you may need to pay for entry - beat check on that - my kids are too old now. Go and take a picnic on a nice day. You won't be disappointed. ||May 30, 2017
T8115FHkristinak||50||I found this place so relaxing. Huge park with many paths and green surroundings. If you want to take a moment and stop the city stress it's perfect place. Also I like that you can buy there ice cream, coffe etc. It's a little bit pricley but still... amazing park||May 30, 2017
happygirl20||40||The park is huge, with walks, a lake where you can hire pedalo boats and watch the swans. There is a cafe, and it's amazingly close to the top of Oxford Street if you want a relaxing break from shopping.||May 29, 2017
laj2e7||40||The park was full of hustle and bustle . There were ponds with birds and English gardens . There were a couple of food carts and one sit down restaurant . This is a great place to bring a picnic or bottle of wine to people watch . ||May 29, 2017
OrlandoAussies||50||What's not to love on a sunny Saturday afternoon? Well maintained park with miles of tracks, ice cream trucks, kids, dogs, bikes, squirrels. This huge space is an absolute haven in the heart of such a large city. ||May 29, 2017
robwU6444XP||50||Have walked Hyde Park many times and will often just sit and people watch. There is always a lot of activity so it is a great spot. Accessible from a few different tube stations. ||May 29, 2017
thesinger1||50||Had a lovely stroll here. There are lots of interesting birds to watch and monuments dotted around to keep this massive expanse of water and grass interesting.||May 29, 2017
ScottishFoodie93||50||I come here often in the evenings to run. There are so many paths that it's rarely very busy and means you can get a good run!On a hot day it's also the perfect place to sunbathe as it gets the sun all day!||May 29, 2017
88emmai||50||Such a beautiful place for a morning run. You don't have to run alone because there is many runners and many people are also having a picnics.||May 29, 2017
Steve R||50||For our first evening in London, we were looking to stretch our legs after the long flight. We ended up at Hyde Park and spent a couple of hours enjoying the beautiful park and great weather. The park is easily accessible from the Hyde Park Corner Underground Station. It is also located near other tourist attractions like Buckingham Palace and the Wellington Arch. The park itself is huge and even though we spent a couple of hours here, we only saw a fraction of it. There are bike and paddle boat rentals available for those who really want to cover a lot of ground (or water). Certain areas of the park are much more crowded than others.There is a large variety of plants, animals, statues, and monuments that can be found within the park. Spring was in full swing so everything was in bloom. Entrance to the park is free, so if the weather is good, this is a no-brainier activity.||May 29, 2017
Sari L||50||We walked through on one of our days when the weather was fantastic. It is a lovely park that attracts everyone. Picnic there if you'd like. ||May 29, 2017
vincentb377||50||From the rose garden to the Serpentine this park is wonderful to explore and relax in. The wide open spaces Nd abundance of wildfowl make it a haven in the city centre. The children love to play with the birds along the bank of the Serpentine and we can sit on the patio outside the café having a nice drink. Well worth it on its own or as part of a wander through the other Royal Parks nearby. ||May 29, 2017
Themissingcase||40||On a lovely sunny day I'd head here. The Rose Garden was in full bloom and fragrant. It's an easy walk, but I'd head for the boating pond and recommend a jug of Pimms to share.Noticed a Police presence but more reassuring than worrying. Sit on the grass or hire a deckchair and watch the world go past.||May 29, 2017
Jan B||40||We walked through Hyde Park when we were visiting Buckingham Palace. It is very nice. It is a park. What can I say? It is well used by locals. There were chairs to rent if you liked.||May 29, 2017
jquim||50||To me, spending a day at Hyde Park was the highlight of my recent trip to London. A great way to disappear into nature for a quiet and beautiful afternoon. There are tons of different "sections" to this park which makes for a diverse afternoon. Lovely, quiet stroll through and you stumble upon so many things that peak interest.Recommend the Lido Cafe just on the water, great patio with a view and the food was surprisingly delicious. Only bettered by lying under the trees by Kensington Palace and watching the grass grow.A must if you're visiting hustle-bustling London, a great way to wind it back for a quiet day||May 29, 2017
F5086SOmarkg||50||A beautiful park with so much to do.I didn't realise how big this place was. Kids went into a play area and had plenty of fun.A great place to go free of charge and the kids can play for hours. Happy days.||May 29, 2017
SFOYYZ_Eric||50||Here for a morning walk. Lots of joggers in the morning. If you like, there are cafes inside too where you can get a cup of morning coffee and light breakfast. Can also rent a bike and bike around the park. It was so peaceful and serene. I really enjoy it. ||May 28, 2017
tjwood2014||40||My husband and two daughters aged 23 and 8 recently stopped for a visit. The gardens are beautiful and very well kept. The Princess Diana Memorial was lovely and the children all absolutely loved it. It was a lovely was to commemorate a lovely lady. We spent the whole day wandering about and my only issue was there could do with more seating at the cafes etc as we ride everyone and couldn't get anywhere to sit.||May 28, 2017
436helenf||40||We sat on the grass for our picnic, then we walked a while and tried to argue with some Christians at speakers' corner, then we sat on a bench for a while and read, then we walked into some beautiful countryside along the north edge, it really felt peaceful and we didn't see anyone for a little while. Then we came to the lake which was gorgeous and bustling with boats and pedalos and wild geese and swans and ducks, and had a cup of tea on a deckchair, and then it was time to go and in a moment we were in Knightsbridge station on the tube. A lovely leisurely afternoon||May 28, 2017
TrondTollefsen||50||During our 4 day London stay we went to Hyde park for two of the days. Weather was perfect so rented sun deck chair and sunbathed for a few hour. It is amazing to get away from the busy London life. ||May 28, 2017
mlg214||50||This is an impressive park in the city ! You have to walk it and just take it in all the beauty you see ! So worth the visit, highly recommend it. ||May 28, 2017
MedEngland||50||Hyde Park is so large (about 350 acres) that studying a map to identify some features worth visiting is suggested. On the western side is the Serpentine lake - if you are walking around it, there is café on the Kensington side. One of my other favourites is the Animals In War Memorial by Park Lane, towards Marble Arch.||May 28, 2017
WorldTravelOne||40||Hyde Park is a big park in London. It gives the city a way to breathe. Although the air quality is not good at all in the city center. Imagine London without parks...||May 28, 2017
alyerpal2015||40||Visited on a hot day. Kept to the west side. It's a huge open space and well kept. The Albert statue was very impressive. The park was used by all sorts for walking running cycling etc Public toilets were clean but come with 20p coins for entry. Princess Diana memorial garden was quite tranquil. The play park was fun and well used. Play equipment was good and there was a splash area. There is also a cafe adjacent but didn't use it. The security appeared quite good and the staff were friendly enough. Walking around the pond was also nice. ||May 27, 2017
Aria818||40||This is a large park located in Central London surrounded by busy roads. You could spend all day walking around this park or walking across from Bayswater to Kensington or from these areas to Park Lane. Kensington Palace is located on the west side of Hyde Park, the residence of Princess Diana. There are ponds, large areas of green space, a large lake named The Serpentine, cafes, the Albert Memorial, Peter Pan Statue and lots more points of interest, including a horse riding path. You need all day to see all the sights. Speakers corner is on the Eastern Edge of the park.||May 27, 2017
Massimiliano C||50||hide park is a beautiful place where you are in completely relax.Squirrels,swans,ducks and many other animals very friendly and free.||May 27, 2017
mimkaBurgas||50||This is a great place for walk; relax; do some sport of have a glass of sauvignon on the shore of the lake with swans. I am totally in love with this place. There are many green areas, where you could even make picnic with friends or just set on the grass and enjoy the day.||May 27, 2017
Sarah T||50||We ended our London trip by taking a walk through Hyde Park at 7.30 am on a beautiful sunny morning. The setting was idylic with just a few joggers and cyclists, along with the military horses being taken for their exercise. The noisest inhabitants were the geese. - delightful.||May 27, 2017
Benjamin L||40||Time span was not available to see all but maybe on the next trip. Bus and train services were great for this short visit. ||May 27, 2017
teenasan3||40||Went here on day of arrival since it was near the hotel. What a lovely park. We found the Peter Pan statue which is well indicated, and saw last very ducks and geese as well as flowers in bloom on the way. ||May 26, 2017

denver60||50||We again visited Hyde Park, Henry Vlll's hunting park, covering 350 acres and home to some famous landmarks including Speakers' Corner, the Princess of Wales Memorial and Serpentine Lake. This iconic park is definitely worth a visit.||May 26, 2017
Deanne M||50||Stopped by the park to visit Kensington Palace and for a quick rest between tourist locations. Beautiful park with lakes, fountains, and benches in both sunny and shady locations. Very relaxing.||May 26, 2017
Kristjan126||50||Hyde park is famous for its concerts, place to have a picnic, You can rent a row boats and so on. But for me, it is a perfect place for morning run, as it is quite big, You can make a long round with out been disturbed by traffic.||May 26, 2017

beckymM8655TK||50||Huge park with lots to offer. We explored on bikes which I definitely recommend as there is a lot of ground to cover. Many places to bring a picnic, bird watch, or just sight see with the famous sculptures and buildings!||May 25, 2017
biblioverken||50||Hyde Park is a lovely spot—step just a few hundred feet inside and you’ll soon forget you’re in the heart of one of the world’s great cities. Only two tall buildings and the London Eye poked above the trees to give away the secret!We stopped in the south side after a short jaunt up through Knightsbridge, and walked westward along the Serpentine late in the afternoon. What a beautiful day it was; lovely flowers, shrubs and bushes everywhere as we went up the path and walked around the Memorial Fountain for Princes Diana. We then headed back to a stately brick refreshment building and sat at a picnic table by the water with some wine and a cold lager, watching the wildlife and the people go by. I can only imagine this place gets very popular in the height of summer.||May 25, 2017
Olivernoaks||40||I live very close to Hyde Park and it is so wonderful to have the open space and greenery to run around, lye in the sun, or whatever takes your fancy. Do be warned though that it is exceptionally touristy around the Serpentine.||May 25, 2017
SimonG2230||40||The park takes up so much land in central London and so many different things to offer! Try paddling around the lake in the row boats!||May 25, 2017

Milla K||40||It's not as big as it's said to be but is pretty clean and nice place to have lunch or enjoy bit of sun (if there is such a thing on sky). ||May 25, 2017
eilforsyth||50||A great place to go to when in London. A perfect spot if you want a quiet sit down. The area is huge and you could spend hours here. A must see place. ||May 25, 2017
X_Specialized||40||Decided to go to the park for an afternoon walk and ran into a nice restaurant with terrace right by the lake. You can't miss it if you walk towards the lake. I only had a nice cold beer, so I can't comment on the food.||May 25, 2017
1966lillys||40||We enjoyed a sandwich and drink in the beautiful London weather in Hyde Park. This park is enormous and quite relaxing and peaceful sitting by the lake for timeout from the hustle and bustle of London.||May 25, 2017
Fiona L||50||Walking through the park either from a break from the traffic or a short cut across town is a real treat. The new horse sculpture is beautiful and definitely worth seeing.||May 25, 2017
MahmoudHammouri||50||I love this ParkA very beautiful green landscapes, with a great colorful flowers.If you are in London, you have to visit this fabulous Park.||May 24, 2017
smilehightravel||50||Hyde Park is a very large park in central London. There is a large area of water called The Serpentine where you will see many ducks and swans. You can also hire out a boat or pedalo during the summer months. It is not very expensive so all can enjoy. There is a large cafe where you can have coffee, ice cream and lunch items. There is also a smaller boating area especially for children with child size boats.||May 24, 2017

ssarah15||50||When in London, don't miss spending an afternoon there! It is huge and can sit in a quiet corner or be in the middle of the hassle. I usually go there to feed the squirrels so if you are an animal lover grab a pack of peanuts and head to the park. ||May 24, 2017
katjam607||50||Very big park, there are a lot of animals, especially birds and squirrels. In the park there is also zoo, but we did not have time to visit it.||May 24, 2017
rdriddermark||50||As a bit of a Tolkien fan who happened to arrive in London during my annual re-read I suddenly understood for the first time why Sam loved the chestnut trees so much. Obviously there's a lot about Hyde Park to love, but if you're a tree-lover at all it's worth it just for these. =)||May 24, 2017
Selandia22||50||Visit Hyde Park when tired of your shopping an sightseeing. You will find places to eat and drink inside. What about a nice cold beer by the lake in the sun, it tastes lovely on a hot day, it sure did for me! ||May 24, 2017
geromam||30||Hyde Park is rather massive. A rather "cultured" park, no natural bushland. We were lucky enough to go on a warm sunny day and witnessed people out getting their rays. Found the whole idea of hired deck chairs rather odd!! Dogs not on leads was another unusual thing. Lots of walkers, families, runners. Any eateries there are very expensive. We were going to have lunch but gave it a big miss...would recommend bring your own from outside. ||May 24, 2017
JMH1986||50||Our family enjoyed a lovely afternoon strolling around Hyde Park. We were excited to see the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, Serpentine Lake and Speaker's Corner. We recommend spending an afternoon having lunch at this beautiful park. It was fun watching families play in the park, joggers and everyone who brought their dogs to the park. This day ended up being a really peaceful and relaxing afternoon for our family.||May 23, 2017
Walter92532||50||Hyde Park is incredible !! History, beauty, good food, the place has everything. I spent most of the day visiting the park and Kensington Palace. There are monuments everywhere, and you can rent bikes or paddle boats. I thoroughly enjoyed the time spent at Hyde Park and highly recommend a visit to anyone in London.||May 23, 2017
70JenniferD||50||Didn't imaging Hyde Park takes over 300 acres in the center of London. Very nice place to relax and get so close to those lovely swans and their babies. You can even rent the boat to paddle in the lake. ||May 23, 2017
Ladylambretta||50||Fabulous place to go and chill or Just walk lots of wildlife love the squirrels ,it's a beautiful place to visit chill out and watch the world go by a must do.||May 23, 2017

notthisgoodathome||50||Wonderful park for all ages.Great place for relaxing away from the bustle of London.Great for runners in the morning.We liked the Italian garden and all the ducks and swans wandering the Serpentine. London is lucky to have this.||May 23, 2017
chrismB7939WN||50||Huge park area with huge ancient trees and wide open grassed areas and multiple lakes and water features. Hire a pedalo or rowboat. Swim outdoors at the Lido halfway down Long Water lake - but bring your wersuit in May! Play in the large and eclectic Princess Diana Memrial water feature. Not really a "fountain", more a pair of rivers with rapids, waterfall and paddling areas to kids aged 2-102. Unheated so needs a sunny day. Can eat in the Park, but in our view avoid the Magazine Restaurant||May 23, 2017
573shirs||50||Went there on a sunny Sunday and it was just perfect and beautiful.The lakes are full of beautiful swans and ducks and it all very pastoral. Great escape from the urban view. Refreshing nature in the middle of the city. ||May 23, 2017
939benjaminv||50||Very nice and big park!! You can hire small boats! Can ride with the bicycle as well and very nice green areas!! ||May 23, 2017
amknl||50||Great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. Huge park, plenty to see and a wonderful place to relax. Though there are other great parks I have yet to see, for being the heart of London, this is the best and most popular to go see. Have a stroll past Kensington Palace and enjoy the lake in front of it. Or have some high tea! Otherwise, just go for a relaxing walk and enjoy the greenery.||May 23, 2017
mjc33908||50||During a break in meetings I decided to have a stroll through Hyde Park. Although it was 26*c there was a lovely breeze and the walk was very relaxing. Great views and plenty of areas to take a rest||May 23, 2017
specialplant||50||Walked through the entire park twice on two occasions. Avoid it on Sundays as it is extremely crowded||May 23, 2017
Fulger19||50||I visited the park 2 times in december 2016. In the afternoon and in a morning. I came back because I had the feeling there is more than I saw the first time. And I was right. Beautiful park, good for sport also, there were a lot of people running in the morning.||May 23, 2017
Lydia_Lau||50||The park is very large and with a large river. My friend has enjoyed her cycle along the river while I was taking photos elsewhere. Since it is in November, we could see a lot of swans in the river and along with the river. With the golden yellow trees surrounding the park, we have taken a lot of beautufil photos in the park. Moreover, I came again in end Apr this year, and the park has some flowers blossoming but the swans were much less than in November. Therefore, I believe the park is always attractive with different sceneries in different seasons.||May 22, 2017
NeilW2422||50||Spent some time here wandering, a lovely open space being enjoyed by many. Grab a deck chair and relax and watch the world go buy for respite from the shopping .||May 22, 2017
misshayley2014||50||This is such a beautiful park with lots of wildlife & a gorgeous place to go for a walk. The squirrels are REALLY tame so be prepared to share your picnic with them!||May 22, 2017
K2043VUjustinm||50||The best part of Hyde park was the foul hanging out throughout the park. You have to go to the pond and spend a moment just watching the swans and the ducks, and whatever else comes along. They don't seem affected by all the people - probably used to them. It was the highlight of the day!!||May 22, 2017
mbarbaragp||30||Hyde Park is a park that everyone wants to visit when coming to London. However in my opinion, London offers much better and less crowded. Some of them that I recommend: Battersea Park, ravenscourt Park, Battersea cemetery Park, Putney heath and Wimbledon Park/Wimbledon Common. My top parks in London, if you prefer wild life and true nature, to visit for a WHOLE day, visit RICHMOND PARK and THEN (on other day of course) go to HAMPSTEAD HEATH. Amazing and totally speechless! ||May 22, 2017
172saidb||50||Each my day off i love to go to Hyde park to rest , reading books but mostly i am skating with my rollerblades . Everywhere is green beautiful.||May 22, 2017
Tamasine W||50||WE just walked thru on our way to Buckingham Palace one Sunday afternoon - sat and watched the swans and the people - enjoyed a cup of coffee...peaceful like Central Park in New York...enjoy it!||May 22, 2017
Wanderer_Jen||50||Hyde park is as amazing people say it is. It is beautifully set up with plenty to see throughout. We started from the southeast corner and walked northward along the Serpentine. We greatly enjoyed watching the ducks and swan families in the lake. We posed with Peter Pan and ended with the beautiful Italian Gardens. I only wonder how much I didn't see in this massive park.||May 22, 2017
su12345||50||We love crossing Hyde Park, always nicely kept and looked after. Worth to visit it in different season, the trees, plants and the flowers are so beautiful.||May 22, 2017
jessiesmam2016||50||The weather was perfect and it was lovely to see so much activity in the park. The abundance of grey squirrels made our day. ||May 22, 2017

ongkj||40||Hyde Park is one of the larger Park in London. Normally you can stroll at the Park at a portion of it at any one time as the park is huge... Because of the trees and plants around, lots of squirrels and birds can be seen all over. Such a romantic park... love it!||May 21, 2017
alexanderlexijones||50||Amongst the hustle and bustle of Central London lies calm and serenity in the form of Hyde Park. No matter what the weather, it's always a nice place to visit, and go for a relaxing walk. ||May 21, 2017
CayUcusZ||50||Hyde Park and the attached Kensington Park are a vast wooded garden of green space. In my opinion, it is the crown jewel of urban parks anywhere and should not be missed. Miles of walking trails, gardens, lakes and green space. You can rent a bike, paddle a boat, have a picnic and enjoy the abundant wildlife. A must see. If you can, take a break from the hectic London and plan at least a half day or longer basking in this lovely park. ||May 21, 2017
jacqui43||50||After a very busy day shopping we decided to chill before the train home and sat in the sun relaxing in this beautiful park. There was lots to do including boats on the lake, horse riding, rollerblading or just like us relaxing in the sun. We used the cafe near the Serpentine and ordered two waffles with ice-cream delicious! ||May 21, 2017
kjjess0p||50||Hyde Park has a mix of formal gardens, a lido, a lake, cafes and wilder spaces. It is a lovely space to meander through.It does not feel like you are in London, until you glance up at the skyline.Not so keen on the Queen Mother gates, but personally I think the 7th July memorial is moving.Had lunch at the Serpentine cafe and we're please to get a seat outside to look out over the lake. It was a limited choice of food, but we were there for the location. The fish finger sandwiches were good.Well worth a visit even if just a brief walk||May 21, 2017
Jessum||40||Lovely stroll through Hyde parkAmazing when it is sunny, very quiet and relaxing in the middle of the dayThe boating lake is great, a perfect date ||May 21, 2017

Travelalot724||50||This is, from my perspective, one of Londons best parks. You can walk, have a picnic, rent a boat, walk, run, or just people watch. It has a peace to it and is a good break from the buzzy London streets! ||May 21, 2017
Beard46||50||Catch No 9 bus from Trafalgar Square to Royal Albert Hall and see more of London. See Albert's memorial and take a walk through the park.||May 20, 2017
Aubrey W||50||Hyde Park is one of those must visit places in London.It's a green sanctuary between the hubbub of Mayfair and Kensington. Yes it gets busy but unless a major event or concert is taking place it still has acres of space to enjoy.There's lots to see and enjoy including numerous statues doted around the park plus the Serpentine which is always buzzing and the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain a favourite attraction for adults and children alike.You can spend a few hours or the whole day.Definitely needs to be on the list of both Londoners and tourists! ||May 20, 2017
ThivaTJ||50||Lot of interesting things to admire while you walk in the park. Calm and peaceful park surrounded by busy roads. Easy to access by public transport. Great place to be on a sunny day. ||May 20, 2017

Rosamaria V||50||Is a beautiful park, is big so you better look at the map! You can walk or use a bicycle. the fields are wide and green, I saw a lot of people with their pets. Inside the park you will find a lake called Serpentine, where you can rent a boat, perfect for dates. I was traveling solo, so I just walked, visited the Peter Pan statue and walked the Princess Diana Memorial walk. ||May 19, 2017
daricesulemane||50||One of the many parks to see in London, Hyde Park is definitely worth a visit even if you have limited time in London. There is a lot to see in this expansive park such as memorials (Princess Diana, Holocaust), statues and fountains. Throughout the year there are numerous events such as the summer concert, Winter Wonderland among others. There are numerous places to explore or sit and have a picnic during the summer days. There are numerous entrances and easily accessible by public transport.||May 19, 2017

Davertravels||50||Living in a city with lack of green space, the gardens in London were a breath of fresh air! We visited most of the gardens in the city almost everyday. Hyde park is absolutely stunning. Its size is enormous and not possible to finish in a single visit but even if you just visit the serpentine river it's enough of an experience.We took my toddler who had a blast feeding the birds, going for a boat ride and playing in the playground. On a separate occasion we even had a picnic in the park & just lazed under the sun.In one part of the park there is this magnificent tree which looks like it's upside down! Am sure you will recognise it if you come across it.||May 19, 2017
CFEIII||40||Hyde park is the biggest park in London, big trees, flowers Serpentine Lake, Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, ISIS statue and so much more, truly a beautiful area to spend some time with nature without leaving the city.||May 18, 2017
Chenille R||50||Loved walking through the park. It was a bit cold when we visited but I can only imagine picking up lunch and sitting at the park for a picnic. So green and lush. We walked the park to the Kensington Palace. Also saw bikes that you can rent that looked fun. ||May 18, 2017
SWMaryland||50||Cheers to London for maintaining such a beautiful public park. It is well kept, manicured, and clean. Filled with people, but you do not feel cramped. They even lay out stacks of chairs for people to use and sit on. Nice touch. ||May 18, 2017
richardson2015||40||by day in sunshine this is a fabulous spot to picnic and people watch. Many locals and tourists congregate to enjoy the greenery and peace amongst the busy city life. ||May 18, 2017
Asizehcnas||40||Hyde Park is truly a marvel, but don't underestimate its size. I made the mistake of walking from one end to the other with my suitcase instead of taking a bus and while I saw much of Hyde Park, I was quite tired. That being said, the size lends to its incredible nature: There is so much to see and do! You can see anything from a variety of birds swimming on the ponds to concerts going on to beautiful gardens to the Albert Memorial. Only cautions is that I would avoid walking around Hyde Park after dark but otherwise please go visit when you have the chance! You can rent a bike while you're at it and enjoy the park at a greater speed or just take a book and sit on a bench and enjoy.||May 18, 2017
Michael C||50||graet place to go for a walk/run or just to see the park spend one/two hours walking around great to clear your head||May 18, 2017
Mamastrosity||40||The infamous Hyde Park. We took a stroll through Hyde Park before getting on to the Big Red Bus Tour. The location is great, Metro station located right at the entrance, as well as bus stops lining the whole park.||May 18, 2017
peterkT5248QZ||50||Parks in London you can't go wrong. Love it nice walk peaceful. Just remember to take monkey nuts and feed the squirrels.... ||May 18, 2017
267paulal||50||I recommend the visit to the park since it is a perfect place to spend the day with the family, with friends on with your love.It opens early in the morning (5 a.m.) and closes only midnight, but I confess that I didn't like walking in there from 6 p.m. and on: I didn't feel safe.||May 18, 2017
Vnordby||50||We loved to take a walk, look at the birds and have lunch on a bench. Several playgrounds and pedal boats for rent.||May 18, 2017
DonDrinx||40||beautiful walk around with bird, squirrel and pigeons, lovely green place to have a short rest in London||May 17, 2017

Ali1701||50||I love this Park. We went there for the whole morning. Just walking around the park. There are many animals and the park is clean! The park is so big that you never see the same things. It is really good to go there on a sunny day.||May 17, 2017
Jeff S||50||We stayed north of Hyde Park near Paddington. It was an easy walk south to the park, through Kensington Gardens, then east through the park to Green Park and St James Park (they are all connected). I have always loved the 3 Royal Park walk as a way to loosen up after a long flight.||May 17, 2017
Brooke E||50||When I first stepped into Hyde Park, I remember thinking how huge it was. My husband and I bought take away fish and chips and brought them here for a picnic. The weather was in our favor, and there was so much space, we didn't feel crowded. Keep in mind that there are chairs here, BUT you have to rent them by the hour. Who needs chairs when there's lots of lush grass around though?||May 17, 2017
davidbA5277DH||50||This is a wonderful park for a bike ride or walk. There are many points of interest and it is well located in the city. My wife and I love to visit this park when we are in London!||May 17, 2017
Julie O||40||a lovely walk through the park. However I'd like more paths to be open for cyclists, as there's plenty of space for this||May 17, 2017
SomeGuyCalledAlex||40||I went down to London for a Photography trip and spend a large amount of time at Hyde Park. I was a very nice walk and has many things to look at, the animals in the lake are great too. A nice break from the over crowded London only minutes away.||May 17, 2017
Flavio P||30||Too many people, tourist, and everything is overpriced if you want to buy a coffee here. The Park is basically a big green space, but you cant really relax anywhere since is full of thousan of people walking by, I strongly suggest other parks, maybe smaller.||May 17, 2017
VictoriaWilson85||50||Had a great horse and cart ride around Hyde Park. Lovely views and thankfully we picked a beautiful day. Love this place!||May 17, 2017
louise852014||50||Such a beautiful place in the centre of such a busy city! When it all gets too much nothing better than relaxing here in the sun with a coffee and book ||May 16, 2017
kendulock||30||It is a huge park in London. If you go to the Serpentine Lake, you can have beers, ice creams, hot dogs, burgers and even rent a bike or paddle boat. Pretty cool activities to do in the summer time. It is definitely a good spacious counterbalance that the crowded central London needs!||May 16, 2017
goncere||50||This park is honestly the best out of the National Parks. Huge area, great pond, it's a nice place to kind of escape the city when you feel like you just can't handle it anymore.||May 16, 2017
Margaret M||40||We were impressed by the size of Hyde Park and yet how the different areas seemed quite intimate. It was a lovely Sunday afternoon for a stroll and there were many others enjoying it too. We went to the Diana Memorial area where lots of children were playing in and out of the encircling fountain. We then wandered down to the Lido to get some refreshments before heading off into the city.||May 16, 2017
garyhP4908WJ||30||Think a small version of Central Park. There is a nice cafe at Hyde Park corner. Of course Kensington palace is at the western end. ||May 16, 2017
G0paT||40||What can I say. Worth the hype. Lovely lake, walk, manicured and well maintained park. Swans came and ate biscuits from my hands. You also get bicycles on rent to cover the entire park. ||May 16, 2017
nanaxs6||50||A wonderful place to clear your mind and enjoy nature. Walk at the pace you are most comfortable or sit and people watch. You won't want to miss this park, we went several times during the week to escape the hustle and bustle of city life.||May 16, 2017
littleexplorer2017||50||The park is famous as it is next to the Queen 's palace and other famous buildings and landmarks. we enjoyed long walks there. ||May 16, 2017
USEuroTraveler1977||50||We decided to take a stroll from our hotel to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace and it was so striking!!! It was actually a partly sunny day and windy. We loved every minute of walking some of the park and taking in the views. Seeing the Palace, Diana Memorial Park and Fountain are a must. Can't wait to come back for another stroll ||May 16, 2017
carlsS521AE||40||One of the many parks in London. This was a great place for a run and to people watch. Connected to the other parks made for a glorious morning. ||May 16, 2017

minjam2016||50||Every time I'm in London I like to take a stroll around Round Pond and along the Serpentine. It's a nice way to take a city break.||May 15, 2017
drowsyzebra||50||We visit London often. If we find we want to get away from tourists and have a little downtime, we will visit one of the parks in London. Nothing better than lying in the sun reading, talking, people watching or having a snooze. I imagine this will be great in the winter with the winter wonderland it has each year.||May 15, 2017
Willitsgoodtotalk||40||We popped into Hyde Park and walked for miles well it seemed like miles, lots of joggers running around, and lots of ducks and swans pleasant couple of hours.||May 15, 2017
kwc973||40||Good place for a walk amongst all kinds of trees. Lakes to walk round. Good cafe for cuppa. You need to be aware of scale of this park. It's big.At this time of year the trees are full of young leaves.||May 14, 2017
Mercury1981||50||We have visited London at Christmas time,and it was very nice at the Hyde park in that time of year. Lots of wooden houses with food and drinks and stuff to buy. Some kind of fair. It was really nice.||May 14, 2017
TravelerWithOpinions||50||Strolling through Hyde Park on a Sunday in the spring is a true delight. We enjoyed seeing trees and flowers that were blooming as well as swans, geese and parrots. The parrots will eat out of your hand (if you have peanuts). Special highlights -- the Italian Gardens and fountains, the Peter Pan sculpture and the Princess Diana memorial fountain. It was wonderful to see the diversity of people enjoying themselves.||May 14, 2017
Kelsielee526||40||Spent time walking through multiple parks in London. It was always nice to leave the busy streets and walk through the tranquility of the various parks. I love being in a city with so many parks to enjoy.||May 14, 2017
j2tatum||50||visited again , it is always worth a walk or chill out before a weekend in london , a nice walk around the serpentine and a stop for a drink - one day the lido will be open when i visit and this would be good too .chill out here before the madness of london and experience the side of london a lot of people dont even knoew exists||May 14, 2017
angelsfuste||50||Just let your feet go and enjoy the nature around you. Early in the morning, you will find just a few runners and walkers that will greet you with a smile. With a little bit of luck, you'll be able to see some squirrels coming to say hello, specially if you give them something to eat.||May 14, 2017
zoe s||50||This is really a royal park, with its standard and size. You can feel the scale the first you facing it, without entering it! Lovely green every where, thousands of flowers and trees, birds and fishes. ||May 13, 2017
Chelseagirl194||50||Many things to see & photos to take!! You never know what you'll find! Still didn't get to every part!!||May 13, 2017
An_Expat_Wife||40||I love to stroll around Hyde Park. You can always find a quite spot to relax away from the bustle of the city centre BUT there are also lots of events held here. Check online. summer concerts and winter wonderland are 2 examples. iIs lovely to take a picnic and enjoy the sun during the summer.||May 12, 2017
D0cumenta||40||Real nature in the heart of London with fresch lawns and lakes. Nice place to stay and eat your breakfast or lunch. Nice stop when going to the Buckingham Palace area.||May 12, 2017

nealjojo||40||the diana fountain was not functioning and there was no explanation!....it was a cold morning so we enjoyed a bracing walk in the park but even so it was a disappointment that the diana 'river' fountain was not working........||May 11, 2017
Michelle W||50||Hyde Park is near Buckingham Palace. It is a beautiful park filled with lakes and lots of fowl. It is a perfect location for a picnic or a stroll. ||May 11, 2017
jimbill||40||The crowds are less and the dusk hours give this place a special feel. Be sure to see Kensington Palace across the water and the Peter Pan statue.||May 11, 2017
goodrobin||40||We enjoyed walking around Hyde Park (and Kensington as well) just to spend a bit of downtime in London. It's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of the big city, but there's this huge green space available to walk through, and maybe enjoy a picnic in or an ice cream. It's a great place to bring children and pets. Plenty of seating around the park for you to make use of if you want to take a break. ||May 11, 2017
madhatterWales||50||We spent a few hours wandering the park and what an empty space in the heart of the city, interesting wildlife, art galleries and Kensington Palace, well worth an afternoon relaxation and exercise.||May 11, 2017
Jocke H||40||Amazing with such a beautiful park in the centre of London. If you're looking for a quiet and joyful walk then this place is a must.||May 11, 2017
UncleIvy||50||It was a sunny day. We had time to slow down and what could be better than a walk in a park. Hyde park. Two days before the london marathon It was quiet and calming. We aimed for the cafe by the serpentine and watched the swans horses and people drift by  Then back to the hustle of city life with a taxi and train to the midlands. ||May 10, 2017
Mary M||50||Walking through this park was like a dream. So green, beautiful flowers and trees as well as a waterway. Quiet and peaceful.||May 10, 2017
leroygrobinson||40||There are many great things to see in the park, Kensington Place as well as various statues and sculptures but, the most worth it is the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. Some say that its not amazing, but the design is innovative and modern, I loved it. ||May 10, 2017
901jeanninek||50||A busy and vibrant place to visit. Walking air riding a bike there is plenty to see and do. We were blessed with beautiful weather which only made it better. ||May 10, 2017
MARC L||40||London is famous for its many green places, enclosed private or public squares, and parks… and Hyde Park doesn't disappoint for its sheer size, diversity of landscapes and styles, follow the Serpentine, the paddle boats, the wildlife, waterfalls. And the Princess Diana Memorial fountain was lovely. It was only a short walk across the park to Kensington Palace. The grounds are so well kept and you get a really great feeling from the locals walking there dogs and playing in the park.You can definitely spend a whole day wandering around this great London Park.||May 10, 2017
Austimum||40||Hyde Park is absolutely beautiful to walk around in the spring. It is easy to combine Hyde Park in a walk to either Buckingham Palace, St James Park and Kensington Gardens. Or as I did all of them over the course of a few hours.||May 10, 2017
msm1990||40||A huge park, lovely place to spend a few hours. The toilets cost 50pence. Lovely long lake, full of herons, swans and other birds. Stop by and say hello to Peter Pan. This park has the Princess Diana memorial fountain and the play ground. One thing you cannot get into that playground if you are an adult without a child. And it is a lovely playground, shame that they do not allow adults to walk through it. Yet the playground across the lake is open to all||May 9, 2017
Baylovers||50||We took several strolls through Hyde Park and enjoyed the beautiful scenery set in the middle of this great city||May 9, 2017
Colin E||50||My tip to anyone who is visiting Hyde Park for the first time is to start at Lancaster Gate tube station and then walk along The Long Water followed by the Serpentine. If you walk on the south side, you will pass Peter Pan's statue, and there is always lots of birds enjoying the Serpentine to enjoy. You should end up at Hyde Park Corner tube station.||May 9, 2017
readytoroll2015||50||This park was just outside of our Hotel and the grounds here are just beautiful. The Princess Diana Memorial fountain was lovely. It was only a short walk across the park to Kensington Palace. The grounds are so well kept and you get a really great feeling from the locals walking there dogs and playing in the park.||May 9, 2017
JGDynamo||40||Spent a bit of time in Hyde Park recently when we were in London. See the paddle boats, the wildlife, waterfowl and the brides that come to be photographed. Great place to stroll through and enjoy.||May 9, 2017
PadiP||40||Parks are great for avoiding the tube, which in is starting to get very warm now. And safe from road traffic. Great way to start and end the day. ||May 9, 2017
MariWolfe929||50||Huge park (much bigger than St. James' Park) but very enjoyable.If you have kids, the Princess Dianna memorial playground will keep them happy. Lots of other memorials to see as well as the Princess Dianna memorial fountain. You can rent bikes right at the park and explore the park that way. I recommend this. If you have younger kids who are not all yet good bike riders, have one parent stay at playground with kids while the other one rents a bike and takes pictures. That is what we did! ||May 9, 2017
John C||50||So many peaceful places to sit and reflect, get your breath or enjoy a picnic after the hurly burly of the city.Trees to sit under, swathes of bluebells and other wild flowers as well as more formal garden arrangements to see and enjoy.A map was very useful as would be easy to get lost in your wandering. ||May 8, 2017
bradley0077||50||Great park & big enough to get away from people. Lots to due & can be peaceful if you want it to be.||May 8, 2017
Olaf S||50||Once we crossed the last intersection into Hype Park, a sense of calm and relief encompassed us. We could enjoy viewing the Albert Memorial, Queen Victoria built in honor of her husband. It has at each corner British domains: Europa, America, Africa and the Far East. The dazzeling Gold on the monument is eye catching and many symbolisms can be ascertained when one looks closely.We strolled on along by the water to a recent fountain in Dianna's honor and stopped by for tea and scones at a lovely restaurant overlooking the water.||May 8, 2017
DMSMD64||50||We spent out winter holiday in London and happened upon the Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. We were just after Christmas, but before New Year’s so the Fair and Marketplace were going strong. The Christmas Market was very large with many stands having holiday themed foods, crafts and gifts to choose from. We both ate lunch and did some post-Christmas shopping. If you are in London at Christmas time, it is worth an hour or a few to visit the Winter Wonderland.||May 8, 2017
ChoccoMonsta||50||My mum lives close by, so whenever the sun is out we walk around Hyde Park. It's quite large and there are small places to purchase ice cream or coffee. On occasions they plan Music gigs as well.||May 8, 2017
surens340||50||Hyde Park is the lungs of London- we have a morning walk everyday- and then one can have breakfast or coffee at the Serpentine Cafe The kids love feeding the ducks and swans- And there is the cute play area- fantastic!||May 8, 2017

inesgsilva||50||This is the largest park in London and one of the largest city parks in Europe. Don't miss it. There are just so many different areas and places of interest to visit there. See the Kensington Gardens and Palace, the Serpentine Gallery, the Royal Albert Memorial or the Lady Di Memorials.||May 7, 2017
Smudge7204||50||We stayed pretty close to Hyde Park, outside of simply visiting this attraction I used it for running in the morning. I was a beautiful place and certainly worth the visit. There is plenty of coffee shops, places to grab a sandwich or ice cream. I visited most of the attractions in London and this was a piece of tranquility in a very hectic city! ||May 7, 2017
MrCaddy||50||Beautiful park in the centre of London.. within seconds your hearing birds sing, looking across beautiful plants, nice lake, busy with joggers and cyclists.. ||May 7, 2017
496emerm||50||About 50 of us mamas met up with our little ones last week for an informal picnic. I applied for a licence and the correspondence between the events planner and I went very smoothly. She was lovely to deal with.We settled ourselves near the Serpentine Bar & Restaurant so we could take turns going in and out for lunch and brunch etc. They we're wonderful in there!We were there from 11 to 5 and the time flew. It was the perfect place for our gathering and it will go down in babywearing and Artipoppe lore as the first Artipoppicnic. Hyde Park was perfect. Easily accessible. ||May 7, 2017
Anna T||50||What a wonderful park in the heart of London. We took leisurely strolls and took many pictures. We saw children on horseback and couples/families with picnics. Hyde Park is also an excellent shortcut between the Dorchester Hotel and Harrod's.||May 6, 2017
Rachel P||50||I love walking round Hyde Park what ever the weather. You never feel like you are in the middle of a busy bustling city! It is one of the places i recommend anyone do when visiting London!||May 6, 2017
mrnnewf||40||Hyde Park is a bustling big city park that is well maintained and has plenty to offer. There are many lovely attractions including the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain and Speakers Corner. There seems to be a plethora of beautiful nooks and crannies to explore. It's clean and well patrolled by the police. Keep in mind to bring change for the restrooms though...they are pay. FYI! Don't miss out on this park. ||May 6, 2017
KJJ16||50||It is well worth taking the time to walk a complete circuit of the park. Some beautiful plants, views and features (we actually saw a heron!) . The cafe/restaurant has plenty of outdoor seating where you can sit and watch the world go by and provides a good range of drinks and snacks at reasonable London prices||May 6, 2017

IainG81||40||I love Hyde Park you can really forget you're in the middle of a large city. Lots of paths some quite footpaths where you can be almost all alone. Fountains, lakes, gardens all great fun. Enjoy.||May 6, 2017

meitan9931||40||My first day in London was visiting the Hyde Park which was nearby where I was staying. The park was big and you can see many people enjoying no matter couples, families or friends. The the Kesington Palace was located inside as well. You may feed the parrots, squirrels and swan but with proper grains.||May 5, 2017
MKJokela||50||A huge park almost in the middle of town. Nicely maintenanced. Good place to go for a run or picnic or just walk around the park. Statues and fountains around the park. Couldn't believe it was so big.||May 5, 2017
sfulton3||40||Nice to be away from the noise of traffic in a city congested with it. Nice place for a stroll though there are runners who sometimes believe they own the park.||May 5, 2017

546abids||50||Ok gotta admit going on a sunny day plays a part like any other place, but Hyde park is truly awesome, with its hidden gardens, to its boating lake to well kensington gardens. Im glad i visited this place and ive i lived anywhere near london i would certainly go again.||May 5, 2017

nellielim||40||A huge park with nice walking and cycling paths and lots of things to do like cycling, jogging, strolling, skating or boating. Shady trees, lovely gardens, fountains and lakes, there's something for everyone. Right in the centre of the city, it is a great place to relax and commune with Nature.||May 5, 2017
caroler160||40||It was nice an sunny, this park is very beautiful and for those who like birds you will be suprise by all the different species. It's worth to spend time in this park and relax from the city||May 4, 2017
RPRBBR||40||This venue is refreshing when trying to take a break from urban "hustle and bustle." Just sit back and enjoy horses, dogs and water fowl (not that many pigeons). Also, a horticulturalists delight given the spectacular flora. Always worth a "stroll in the park."||May 4, 2017
143drewr||50||Good place to chill out most any time of the day. If you want to see it all be prepared for a lot of walking. ||May 4, 2017
jamerguk||40||Hyde Park is a great location in central london to sit and relax, exercise or people watch. With good public transport links and in close proximity to lots of shops, bars and restaurants, it's a beautiful place to escape the bustle of the roads.Keep an eye out for outdoor events and gigs, always things going on (free and paid for) that you can get involved with.And if you get restless, take a short walk down towards the Serpentine and Green Park.||May 4, 2017
Lara B||40||I've been to Hyde Park several times over the years, I even used to live nearby it, and I never get bored of it.Apart from the fact that it is massive and it has so many different beautiful places, it's easily accessible, and it offers such wonderful sceneries. Picturesque and soothing for the soul, the nature and animals are a small oasis in the heart of London.I advice every tourist -or anyone really- to pay it a visit. ||May 3, 2017
Amber L||50||Everyone has heard of Hyde Park, so sometimes you're left a little disappointed. I was not! Beautiful gardens, individual rose gardens, I wanted to stay forever. The English spring did not deter us! ||May 3, 2017
AndyBaker65||50||You can easily spend many hours here. Lots of walking to do plus you have Kensington Palace and gardens at the one end and Marble Arch at the other. Lake in the middle with places to eat and even boating. One for couples and families too.||May 3, 2017
Cindy P||50||I used to live near Hyde Park (Notting HIll/Bayswater) and made good use of the park in the summer for sunbathing as our flat had no outside space. Hint; chuck our towel down near a bush for privacy as the moment you're in an open space; the guy let out for the day will sit near you banging his hammer into imaginary things (trust me, it happened - funnily enough, I moved..) or a lively bunch of amateur football players will start a game near you although they do apologise when the ball hits you in the end (ref above, move, find a bush..) Tangent.. all that aside, it's beautiful with so much greenery, trees, paths (I've been lost so many times - do take a compass if you're as geographically challenged as I am. You have Buck Pal on one side, The Ritz on the other (that's another review - yup, been twice heh heh..) and a whole lot of other stuff bordering. It's got so much to offer for children's entertainment and also, adults can pop into M&S in Marble Arch and get some food and beverages (alcoholic ones optional obvs..) and just chuck a blanket out and chill. Done that and it's so much fun - stick near a pub for the loo though :):)||May 3, 2017
Codyz404||40||Very nice, large park. Unfortunately we were there on a cold and rainy day so we didn't get to enjoy it too much, but still felt the need to go check it out. We went early and there were still plenty of people out and about going about going about their day. There appeared to be a restaurant that served a hot breakfast near the lake and there were several small snack stands for people. ||May 3, 2017
Kaessie||50||Everyday of our 4 nights city trip we visit Hyde Park for at least an hour. To come at east, to play with a boomerang, to watch the squirrels or just to cross it to go to the other side. Beautiful gardens, clean restrooms available. Very nice||May 3, 2017
Aneta B||40||This the most popular park in the world! It doesn't change for years. Always clean and spacious for everyone to be in there.In summer you have to go to eat lunch there. Just sit on grass and enjoy the sun.||May 3, 2017

Inside there are some interesting features too eg Isis. Diana's waterfall was a bit underwhelming though. Wildlife in the form of fairly tame squirrels, parrots and even a heron! make your way to Albert's memorial near to the Albert Hall - that is quite something to see. Then over to Kensington Palace and Diana's gardens which are beautiful.||May 2, 2017
Merran||50||This is a great way to connect Kensington with Oxford Street, and takes in the Albert Memorial and the Albert Hall. ||May 2, 2017
Pedjica||50||Very beautiful park for spending time and rest under the sun! It is very clean, have lot of places for sitting and walkin around and it is realy big place. Romantic.||May 2, 2017
MarijnHG||50||After so many visits to London we finally went to Speakers corner on a Sunday. This was great fun, as the audience is continuously challenging whatever speakers climb on their kitchen chair or empty crate of Medoc wine.||May 2, 2017
bauer24||50||It's one of the most beautiful park I've ever seen. All the time I came back I'm stunned, you can find a lot of squirrels inside that are looking for peanuts and swans in the lake, you can take a coffe looking at the serpentine in the terrace and take a long walk inside the green all around of you.||May 2, 2017
rajeevemirates||50||The best place i visited during my weeks vacation in London was Hyde park. Very well maintained and a breath of fresh air in the middle of central london. There is a small restaurant near the lake( Lido) and having a breakfast near the lake was a memorable experience. ||May 1, 2017
Po-Kang W||50||The park has large lawns with a lot of mature trees. There is a beautiful late in the middle, shaped like a river. It even has a bridge with stone arches over it, with car driving over it. The cafe next to the lake is just delightful||May 1, 2017
RoanB24||50||Its so huge that you forget your in london. really worth a visit, lots of runners, squirrels and swans||May 1, 2017
812shivk||50||Londoners are spoilt for choice when it comes to parks as they are green, huge, have free access with great biodiversity around them.. This place is again a gem of a sort with beautiful lakes full of pelicans and birds of different kinds.. You can feed the pigeons as there are a lot, have sumptuous food inside, find your corner and find little peace!||May 1, 2017
aban C||40||For anyone visiting London a Sunday visit to Hyde Park is essential. Take the Tube to Speakers Corner and listen to the arguments on sundry topics but mainly focussing on God, Christianity and the pros and cons of other religions. Some are quite heated and in all honesty its best not to get involved !Thereafter walk in a leisurely fashion towards the Serpantine. You are free to do some boating if you have the time and inclination. Cross the Bridge and visit the Princess Dianne Memorial which is a truely marvellous creation for the cities kids. The area has to be seen to be believed ... a fun area for the family AND clean and beautifully maintained. Certainly an enjoyable day - just to RELAX !||May 1, 2017
FiveStarrPlus||50||This is a great spot to have a picnic , every summer I visit Hyde park with friends and or family , it's beautiful, lots of greenery and a lake with peddle boats ! If your looking for a relaxing day out in summer or somewhere to take a nice stroll, read a book or just relax, then Hyde park is your place ! Very close to Marble Arch and oxford street so you can pop to the shops if too much relaxing isn't your thing! Great for all ages and they have a cafe by the lake Which is great during summer when you want to admire the view||May 1, 2017
Babbel25||50||The park is an oase in the middle of the big city. We took a bike which you find anywere downtown Londen. For only 2 BP a day you can see Londen by bike. Bikelanes are in the park. Go to the Serpentine for a lunch by the waterfront. Or rent a waterbike to explore the lake in the park. ||April 30, 2017
MRSA240115||50||Waiting for the shops to open we realised that we hadn't been to the park in years. We decided to go for a stroll What a delight - we never bothered going to the shops; we rented a 'Boris Bike'; took a trip on the paddle boats; sat watching the swans and took in some 'tourist' sights. Highly recommended. ||April 30, 2017
SusieQ2001||50||I took a long walk through the city and Hyde Park. It is beautiful and a very refreshing refuge from the chaos of the city it sits in the center of,||April 30, 2017
hombreturquesa||40||We spent the whole day at the park , walking among beautiful flowers and trees, so pretty and green. The only thing this place lacks is public toilets and believe me if you spent two or three hours at this place you will need one. There are one at each end gate and the gate machine broken down and you cannot get in , and at other gate at the park uses 20 p coins with a broken coin exchange machine near by. A pitty that so nice park will be have these issues||April 30, 2017
rytz88||50||Hyde Park is the go to place in London for a cheap sunny day out, plenty of spots to relax and just enjoy your surroundings. Also plenty of kiosks and ice cream venders to keep you refreshed. As well as lots of little bits of must see areas, Diana's garden, the serpentine, peter pan to name but a few.||April 30, 2017
CenterFielder||50||We always include time for a stroll through Hyde Park on every visit to London, usually our first day. It is a great place to unwind and get away from the bustle of London. There are many species of waterfowl.||April 30, 2017
carmensakura07||40||I came with my parents. It was just a nice place to relax and walk about. There was alot of people but since the park is huge, there is enough space for everyone when we went.Loads of greenery and animals.It's really lovely park.||April 30, 2017
noorahma||50||So beautiful for walking and relaxing. I think it only needs few restaurants to be great and some guidance signs.||April 30, 2017
Z5694ZRjonb||40||we live a few miles from hyde park and reguarly visit especially in the summer when you can enjoy a stroll and an ice cream!you dont need much money to enjoy the park just a few quid for refreshments or bring your own we often bring a packed lunch and drinks and just buy an ice cream later.Be sure to check out speakers corner for some interesting debate if thats your thing ,and some interesting characters!||April 30, 2017

raymond5ng||50||It is so big that we spend 2 hours for walking and taking photo by a straight line inside the park. It is very nice to visit the park in the early morning.||April 29, 2017
Kyle S||50||We enjoyed Hyde Park as part of our seven mile Princess Diana Memorial Walk.The park is divided by the Serpentine and the Long Water. We enjoyed a lunch at the Italian Water Garden Cafe.On a previous summer visit we marveled at the rose garden, and laughed at The Jelly Belly family sculptures. This visit we viewed the Still Water and the Standing Stone, as well as the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial ||April 29, 2017

Eleni P||50||Take a break from busy London and relax in this beautiful park.You can stay all day (if it's not raining ), read a book, watch the squirrels or the ducks in the lake, have lunch .I appreciate it.||April 29, 2017
Kiri49||40||Left the Natural History Museum and headed up to Hyde Park, unfortunately we under estimated the size of the park , thinking it was walk able to Mount St. (it's not really). Big and popular .||April 29, 2017

Racolta R||50||Nice place and very relaxing park. I didn`t like the cars who are dring trow. I saw a lot of birds: swams, many kind of ducks and gooses, pigeons, horses, squirels. Good work to they that are manage the park.||April 28, 2017
nick2tang||40||I enjoyed this very much. however i do not like the swans as they are large and scary. Other than that I would have given this 5 stars.||April 28, 2017
Timoffy W||50||Hyde Park is a great, easy to reach spot for those lovely sunny days when you don't really want to do much, but you want to be outdoors! If you go, make sure to pop into the Serpentine Gallery!!||April 28, 2017
Dennieob||40||saw many trees in bloom lakes and statues. great for just getting some quiet time on your way to the Victoria and Albert museum||April 27, 2017
euhp||50||London's Hyde Park is one of the greatest city parks in the world.The Park has two lakeside restaurants which are licensed and serve everything from a three-course meal to a quick cup of coffee. Hyde Park is home to a number of fascinating buildings and monuments, such as The Serpentine Bridge, the Joy of Life fountain and the famous Archiles statue. And with the Diana Memorial Fountain and open air events throughout the year, there’s always something to see and do. ||April 27, 2017
bertha_borneo||50||Coming here during early spring but the park has already burst in vibrant display of green, white and yellow from the daffodils. Very nice to walk around and enjoy the sun||April 27, 2017

Momsaidtravel||50||Keep in mind, Hyde Park, like a lot of the parks in London, is huge. We happen to have a hotel room over looking Hyde Park. We stayed at the Hilton Hyde Park, and the view that overlooked Hyde Park was amazing. Directly outside the door of our hotel was Hyde Park, the main entrance to Hyde Park! It is a lovely way to stroll to the other side of the park. There are a few ponds located inside Hyde Park, and even Kensington Palace. Kensington Palace has beautiful gardens that you don't have to buy a ticket to walk around and see. The gardens I highly recommend doing that while you were in Hyde Park. I we actually ran out of time because we wanted to see more of Hyde Park but unfortunately just did not have the time to see the whole park because it's massive.||April 26, 2017
Inês C||50||We took bicycles from one of the stations in the park and rode all around the park. You can see the birds, ear the silence or have a picnic.||April 26, 2017
mandy r||40||This is a lovely green space in the middle of London. It is a pleasant walk through from Kensington Gardens to Hyde Park Corner, especially alongside the Serpentine, where you can watch the paddle boats on the water and see the wildlife such as herons.||April 26, 2017
DrRobertRehovot||50||Beautiful well groomed fields of grass, trees and paths. So areas designed gardens and some wilder areas. Numerous birds and water fowl live here.Definitely the place to spend some hours.||April 26, 2017

uSAmomSally||50||Walked through Hyde Park many times on the way to sights. Yeh paths were well well displayed on maps. The walkways were clean and clear. The foliage was in all its glory. On the day of one of my walks there were hundreds of young folks congregating and a number of police u its were on site in case trouble broke out, but all was chill.||April 25, 2017
pmash88||50||Highly recommend a walk through this park easy morning before the crowds and screaming kids arrive. We had a pleasant walk, grabbed a coffee from one of the stalls. The rose garden area is nice. ||April 25, 2017
Ariel L||50||Hyde Park is simply gorgeous. It is huge so it's hard to see everything but I think the best way to enjoy it is just walking through on a sunny day (if you are so fortunate with weather). The park is clean and you see locals and visitors just relaxing away from the crowded streets of London. A wonderful way to take a break from touristy activities.||April 25, 2017
roborhlpow||50||I had an early morning walk in Hyde Park today, it was a wonderful Spring morning, warm in the sun but chilly walking in the shade. I thoroughly enjoyed the wide open space as you enter from Marble Arch end, you have to beware of the cyclists and horses but once across the road it's only joggers and dog walkers. The walk down to the boating lake takes about 10 minutes and then walking around the lake is a pleasure with all the wildlife going about their business! During the summer it can be very busy but if you go early it's well worth it. ||April 25, 2017
Natashatare||50||Hyde park is a fantastic place to hang out on any occasion. sit near the man made lakes, chill underneath a tree, watch the skate artists on a Sunday afternoon. Loads to see and do and a lovely space to relax in the sun.||April 25, 2017
JarrodMZ||50||Lovely for a late afternoon stroll after a busy day in London. Close to many Tube stations and easily accessible. ||April 24, 2017
yxinyi98||50||Come here on a sunny day, and enjoy the beautiful lake and just take a stroll or cycle around. If you plan on cycling, take note that there are designated paths for cycling. In the end, I hopped off my bike in order to walk inside the park near the lake.||April 24, 2017
Lucy L||50||If you have time walk around the whole serpentine, from the Lido bar (great pimms), and up to the Italian sunken gardens and back round again (via the Serpentine bar). If you're not in love with London by then, nothing can save you. If you have kids, try to take them to the Diana Pirate Park near the Lancaster gate. It is absolutely brilliant for them; wet areas, sandy areas, a massive pirate ship, instruments to play, trees to hide in and it's FREE! There are two other great parks closer to the Rutland Gate, a larger one with swings in, slides etc and a smaller one (which also houses a workout area for people 15+ and tennis courts). I'd recommend getting your little person a scooter so you can transport them easily and scootering around the parks will exhilarate and exhaust them. Also in summer the rose gardens closer to Hyde Park corner are beautiful and further toward Kensington you will come across the Royal Albert Hall and a beautiful statute of Albert. The Royal Albert Hall is worth walking all the way around the exterior. Get lost.||April 24, 2017
Heather T||40||i spent a day wondering around the park looking at the statues, memorials, fountains and birds. There was plenty to do and see along with a number of cafes and food/drink outlets. A good way to spend a warm sunny day.||April 24, 2017
LadiesUsedToVamp||50||Hyde Park is an absolutely massive spectacle of greenery and is larger than the kingdom of Monaco. Centuries ago it was a royal forest and park where kings hunted, today the average person can run, jog, play, and ruminate. Many people come to see the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain and Walk which I found to be simple. Much more attractive to me was the Peter Pan monument that commemorates the park's role in flushing out J.M. Barrie's timeless imagination of one our most beloved fairy tales. It showcases the park's ability to reflect the majestic natural world. From white swans to perfumed gardens to the walk to Prince Albert's imposing monument flanked by the Royal Albert Hall, this park is breathtaking. And it is free! A must-see whenever you are in London. ||April 23, 2017
CdnTravelFan||50||This is a nice stop in London. We were lucky to have an hotel close. With the noisy city this is a nice stop to walk. In the summer it should be nicer. ||April 23, 2017

bamerick92||50||I'm from the NYC area, and I can definately say I enjoyed a walk through Hyde Park more than Central Park. Hyde Park is large enough and remote enough that There's not a lot of people around. I sow t the last day of my visit at Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. Great, slow way to end a hectic week.||April 23, 2017
TomToowoomba||50||Amazing green space in the heart of London. Only the two of us at 6am discounting the squirrels. Great way to start the day before coffee and breakfast. ||April 23, 2017

Angus D||40||I came here on a sunny day in April to chill and have a nice time. My and my brother when rowing at it was pretty good. Of course everything in the area is expensive, but it's certainly nice to just go around for a couple of hours. ||April 23, 2017

309kirstyf||50||I was staying near by so came on an early evening run through park and loved it! There was bustle and busyness but also a sense of hidden quiet places too. Beautiful ancient trees, wide walk ways, nature, squirrels, herons and water birds. I enjoyed visiting the landmark statues - the Henry Moore arch, Peter Pan - the Diana memorial fountain. People watched Ng around the lake was great, pedal and row boat hire, good value deck chair hire and a mixture of cafes and ice cream vans, I was so happy to rediscover this place!||April 22, 2017

FATOSHKAYRA||50||It's huge . It's best visited on a sunny day... Perfect for families.... Perfect for everyone actually.... You can walk , run , take a boat , have a picnic , sun bathe, bike ride , horse ride, feeding nuts to the friendly squirrels .... There's always something to do for anyone of any age .... We were there a couple of weeks ago on a very sunny Sunday, it was packed with people.... Serpentine especially, people queuing up for boat rides ... Queues to buy a beer or four were equally long :))This is my favourite park in London and St. James's comes second...Although I've been here so many times I still enjoy it all the same .... Best place ever to people watch and after a few minutes of it realise such a truly cosmopolitan city London is .... All sorts of people from all over the world are here in harmony and peace.... The only time I really enjoy this park in winter is when the massive Christmas wonderland fair is on , different sort of magical otherwise I much prefer to come here on dry , sunny days of spring and summer ...Highly recommended...Happy holidays:)))||April 21, 2017
sopapanr||40||i spent the whole day at the park , walking amongs cherry blossoms, so pretty and green. The only thing this place lacks is public toilets. There are one at each end gate and the gate machine broke down u cannot get in , and at other end gate needs 20 p coins with broken coin exchange machine. so what else can u do? Pee on the grass?||April 21, 2017
jenk373||50||I was looking forward to a walk through Hyde Park only to have the reality of 4/20 thrust upon me with all its gory. Yes. Gory. The park, usually serene and gorgeous, was crowded and noisy with excessive smoke and haziness. I was told kindly by my host that it was 4/20. You will have to look it up yourself for you to understand my amazement of what was going on. Definitely avoid 20 April if you want to experience the real Hyde Park. ||April 20, 2017
4sarip||50||For everybody not liking big cities, this is absolutely fabolous place! So green and you cannot see any buildings to the park.||April 20, 2017
23rita||20||Had wanted to visit the park before leaving for London, but having seen two sides of it from a taxi cab, decided to cross it off my list as there were no flowers. A few days later, ended up going through Hyde Park in order to get to Kensington Gardens. We entered Hyde from Oxford Street and walked about half an hour to an exit and did not see one single flower which matched the view from the taxi cab. We saw just some unremarkable trees and overgrown weedy grass ~ the grounds were mostly empty space. We did see some picnickers and a classroom of elementary aged children at play, dog walkers and joggers. There was a cannibus festival taking place near the entrance and a tremendous police presence. I would not recommend this park, however I would highly recommend St James Park and Kensington Gardens Park!!||April 20, 2017

You can also hire a boat here to escape from the crowds.We enjoyed this park very much!||April 20, 2017
Stephanie W||50||Hyde Park is a beautiful park to wander around, enjoy the birds and people watch, rent a paddleboat or bikes, or enjoy a picnic.

Xante||50||We visited here on a beautiful April sunny day with the park gardens looking immaculate. We walked across the full length of the park from Hyde Park Corner to the Italian Gardens.The Serpentine was busy with boaters and the cafes were full of people enjoying a drink and lunch in the sun. We sat basking in the sun in the Italian Gardens and when you closed your eyes you could have imagined yourself anywhere but a capital city. Well worth a visit when in London, especially when the sun is shining!||April 19, 2017

lbhorton1953||50||I visited London in the spring just to enjoy the flowers in the park. The park provides for a leisurely stroll in the middle of London. I purchase a hotdog and drink from a street vendor and enjoyed a picnic while watching the world go by. There are parks all over London and you are never far from one. They are well maintained and the landscaping is beautiful. Take time to enjoy them. ||April 18, 2017

Brian_Trip2014||40||A massive park by any standard......once you have seen all the tourist attractions, go and spend time in hyde park......kiddies can feed the swans or play on the grass....adults can have a fun boat trip on the water or just relax with a picnic......or have scones and cream....and English tea. It is very peaceful around the Princess Diana memorials. Worth a visit||April 17, 2017
OriginalOldGoat||50||You can walk & cycle but with restrictions for as long as you want. There are many different aspects to the park from long water & the serpentine with cafes around them. There many statutes and of course the princess's memorial fountain. Parakeets fly around and will come close if there are seed for them.Kensington Palace is on the west of the park and for 2017 you can see the white garden dedicated to the princess as there is a Diane fashion story within the palace.It is free so you can see it all in one day if you have to or take a few visits at your leisure.Well worth a visit anytime of the year ||April 17, 2017
Elizabeth I||50||My husband and I really wanted to make it through Hyde Park, but our feet were hurting from days of walking. We decided to rent bikes that are available at several locations near the park. This was a GREAT decision - the flowers are in bloom, and the views were so beautiful and peaceful! ||April 17, 2017
Hanna G||50||We ventured to the park on a sunny afternoon after spending the morning at the Natural History Museum and picking up lunch from Harrod's food hall on the way. After strolling for a while we bought a coffee and found a park bench for our lunch overlooking the lake. After lunch hired out Santander bicycles for £2 at the park entrance and cycled around leisurely for an hour or so. Lovely way to spend a sunny spring afternoon.||April 17, 2017
C3746JZmichellea||50||The place is so big. I went there for a concert and I had an amazing time. There are ice cream cans to keep u cool. It's a nice place to have a picnic or to ride your bike.

There's a restaurant close to the lake with many options, from meals to snacks and biscuits for an afternoon tea. The children's playground is very nice, fenced and small enough to let the children run freely. It was a nice break after a whole day sightseeing.||April 17, 2017
AmitabhGupta||50||Hyde park is NY Central Park multiplied manifold (i love Central Park... dont get me wrong). Its beautiful, open, lakes... ducks in the lakes... u just can chill out here (and esp if you have young children.. like we had)... u will always fall short of time. Please do visit as a picnic.||April 17, 2017
Kirsi L||50||Hyde Park is great place to visit with kids. We rented bikes for part of the time. Princes Diana's memorial water fall was beautiful and tranquil place||April 17, 2017
JNWSuisse||50||Hyde Park is enormous. On the south west corner are lovely flower gardens and on the western edge Kensington Palace, open to the public. If you are crossing from Kensington to Mayfair walk through the park rather than on the streets.||April 16, 2017
pezianni||40||Good for the lake and to see ducks and lovely at Xmas for winter wonderland and good for summer events check for events held here but also good for warm days ||April 16, 2017
Geneva2009||40||spend enough time so that you can get to walk to all corners of the park . do NOT think about swimming in any water||April 16, 2017
Digital A||50||I've come to this park three different times on two different trips and always had a great time. After exploring and touring the city its such a nice break to come here and unwind with some green space! Its also a great 'short cut' to some attractions like the Buckingham Palace if you like exploring on foot and want to see the changing of the guards!||April 15, 2017
Siri000||40||Quite busy, but still lovely to relax. Especially lovely in the sunshine. Enjoy a chilled walk through the park and people watch. There is a cafe, but it was very busy.||April 15, 2017
Judith M||50||So much to see and a wonderful space for walking. Why take a tube when you can walk through to wherever you want to be! ||April 15, 2017
TrevorD628||40||Hyde is a very large park and it has some interesting areas, like speakers corner where anyone can get on a soap box and speak. It's large and lovey and if you're looking for nature in London a great place to find it. Do watch out for horses as there is a stable on site and people do ride.||April 15, 2017
jackie7014||50||Hyde park is one place I can't get enough of whenever in London. Chillin' by the lake is a good way to spend a weekend afternoon. ||April 15, 2017
437metter||50||When the Sun is shining in London, the place to be is Hyde Park. This giant park is kept very nicely by numerous gardeners. We went back several times during our stay to enjoy the flowering trees, the well groomed flower beds, the curious squirrels and just to look a all the other people passing by. I personaly loved the Japanize inspired garden next to the Sentinel Cafe. ||April 15, 2017
FabiolaFersura||50||In a busy city as London it's always amazing to find a huge park where you can chilled, do some sports or even get in your bikinis if it's summer. ||April 15, 2017

Ariella35||30||We visited Hyde Park last week during the very warm sunny weather. It was filled with families, and people enjoying the sunshine. Many people had picnics from Whole foods or home and were biking, or eating on the huge grassy expansive areas. There was a lovely pond as well with many swans and ducks. It felt very welcoming and there was enough space that it didn't seem overly crowded despite all the people.We didn't go around the entire massive park, as time didn't permit that, but it seems like there's lots of things to explore if you have the inclination and weather is cooperating. Not a must do for us as a recommendation, but it's worth a visit if you're in the area.||April 14, 2017
berdy6||30||I visitied London in december 2016. Also a visit to Hyde Park. It is a large park. Not very attractive park is my opinion||April 14, 2017
JimMaura||50||My daughters and I visited Hyde Park on March 15, 2017. The weather was fantastic, the flowers were starting to bloom and there were a lot of people playing sports and enjoying the outdoors. The large park offers tranquility in the center of London and is a great place for a peaceful walk or picnic. We walked through Hyde Park on our way to Kensington Palace. If you are visiting Kensington Palace & Gardens, I recommend that you include Hyde Park.||April 14, 2017
Rachels_great_find||50||Hyde park is a huge park where you can go for a walk, run, eat, picnic, sightsee. Food and drinks at the stalls\cafes can be expensive so if you're on a budget go to the nearest supermarket and bring your own lunch to the park. On a sunny day Hyde park will be busy but there is plenty of space to sit a get a great view of the lake. You can get paddle/rowing boats to go around the lake yourself but make sure you go when it isn't busy or else you will be in the queue for a LONG time!! Toilets are available here, it cost 20p to go so make sure you have change. If you don't want to pay there is a McDonald's near Marble Arch. Overall this is a beautiful park- must see if you're in London!!||April 14, 2017
Christer v||50||This is a large park with lots of space for finding a relatively quiet spot, even on sunny and busy days.||April 14, 2017
Zara A||40||Fun place to plan a picnic or just to spend time with the family. Would recommend paddle boating on Serpentine Lake with friends or family, but make sure to go when it is not too busy as the line can get very long sometimes. Try to stay away from the parts that are crowded with tourists like the area near the Marble Arch if you want a quiet and peaceful atmosphere.||April 13, 2017
NikonGlass||30||Have been here before. Basically it's a huge urban expanse of lawn and trees. I don't find that it has any focus to hold my attention. Of the various public parks in London I prefer the smaller ones that are a short distance away. ||April 13, 2017
michaelthomas79||50||Sun and a ice cream and a wonderful park in the middle of London.The serpentine lake is amazing , I like to take some walks when its sunny, hyde park is one of my favourites in London .||April 13, 2017

693kallep||50||During our week in London I visit Hyde park three Times, all with different purpose. One morning run, early, fresh and much to see.

533omarn||50||Love the park. Has everything even a lake & a Buddhist temple! This park can bring you to Oxford Street/ Marble Arch if walking from Queensway||April 13, 2017
leuveen||50||Hyde park IS Hyde park after all - first of all, it is huge, so even if all the tourists in London decide to go there you will still be able to enjoy yourself - so don't even think of not going. This is a great place for a walk, lunch break, meeting up with your friends, riding a bike or anything else you can think of!||April 13, 2017
clinton25||40||What a beautiful green haven in the middle of London. From lush green lawns to wooded areas with full path access through the park. Keep your eyes out for squirrels and the occasional horse. If you are a runner brilliant spot for a run especially early morning ||April 13, 2017
IsobelandDick||50||Lovely pleasant park to wander around in for hours, so much to see and do. It was a lot bigger than I imagined.||April 12, 2017

markhoman1962||40||Like most of the London parks on a good sunny day a stroll through the park and an ice cream, it's what London is all about in the summer||April 12, 2017
Ian N||50||Came here on a sunny Sunday to sit and have cheese and wine. Was very surprised to find such a large green area in the centre of London. Even though very busy plenty of places just to sit and relax without people invading your space. We where here for around 4 hours and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Have to say you need to be very open minded as people do what they do and some things you see are very bizarre and push the realms of perceived reality.||April 12, 2017
ALSABIE||40|| It's the largest park in London and there's a lake with restaurant, it's great for outdoor activities during sunny day and great for kids .||April 12, 2017
Steve S||40||Beautiful big open spaces, speakers corner and all of the individual characters, picnic on the grass and people watch. For me its not so important the weather, dress accordingly and you have no problem. A wonderful oasis in the center of the big city, never get tired of visiting.||April 12, 2017

Manchester11||50||It was a warm day in April the sun was out and the world was pleasant. We wanted to go to The Science Museum and rather than use the Tube or busses it seemed reasonable to walk. We were staying in central London and a few minutes with a map showed that the best route was up the Mall into St James up past Buckingham Palace then into Hyde Park following the paths that run alongside Rotten Row. We deviated into the many gardens that follow this pathway to see the magnificent early flowers of spring. As we drew near to the Albert Memorial We turned left toward the museum exploring some side streets containing Embassies and some garden squares. Arriving at the Museum we did though go strait to the cafe for a lunch snack.||April 12, 2017
MaryAnnL266||50||Beautiful park, great for a leisurely walk, bike ride, or just people watching. Check the maps for memorials, statues, etc, or just pass through and enjoy.||April 11, 2017
Crackers2010||50||I love going to this park each visit to London. I love visiting the new cafe at Kensington Palace for a light lunch and tea and sweet and sitting outside in the sunshine at their tables. I also enjoy the Orangery Restaurant and just walking around the park and looking at Kensington Palace and the grounds, pond and the gardens or just sitting in a deck chair by the pond/lake and enjoying myself.||April 11, 2017
Felicia P||40||lived for almost 2 years very close to Hyde Park and I enjoyed so many times walking around, running around, eating on the grass. admiring the trees. Good and nice memories with friends picnicking in the summer. ||April 11, 2017
Joelkaufmann||50||Like Central Park in New a York, Hyde Park in London is a masterpiece. A fabulous park right in the middle of the city. ||April 11, 2017
EklundsOnTheMove||50||We were here on a warm April day. Park was full of people laying out in the grass soaking up sun, dogs playing ball, and kids enjoying a day outside. The park is beautiful and an easy walk.||April 11, 2017

travelmd89||50||I loved strolling through Hyde Park on a warm Sunday. Beautiful views and so relaxing. I loved walking by the lake and seeing people feeding the birds and watching their dogs run around. We walked the whole park and really enjoyed it. We started at Buckingham Palace then walked to and through Hyde Park before heading to Kensington Gardens. It was a great day!||April 11, 2017
ATLBuckeyeGirl||30||OK - I'll probably get crucified for this, but I was less than impressed with the park. Yes, it's huge and certainly a lovely distraction for a sunny day. But I found the park, un-kept and lacking decent floral displays. The grass wasn't mowed, weeds, etc.... I don't know - I was just expecting more. I wouldn't bother going again unless it was for a picnic with friends or something because it simply doesn't offer much.||April 11, 2017
Fitnessworldexplorer||40||If you are staying nearby Hyde park is the perfect location for a morning workout, run, walk or body weight exercises and full of people doing the same. Also great to walk off the morning breakfast buffet if you're staying nearby. A great Park, worth taking a little time to explore on your trip to London.||April 11, 2017
ShoaibD16||50||truly saying words are not enough for this place specially nature lovers and the people who love silent and peaceful place the view is amazing winds are cold and lake was excellent highly recommended to the travellers who are travelling to U.K. do stop over and experience this place truly mesmerising ||April 11, 2017

Lillian C||50||a special place to bike safely improve your spins, the nordic walking section, a tennis section somewhere, if you can find it, the summer attractions tend to get over booked, n loud, and inwinter closes early so any shortcuts from south of hyde park, KNIGHTSBRIDGE to bayswter is a hit and miss, ||April 11, 2017
bcaptured||50||Despite Londons busyness, Hyde park is the perfect place to find quiet and calm and still be right in the cities heart. Perfect resting spot after a long day of exploration! ||April 11, 2017
Claude F||50||We walked along both sides of Hyde Park to make our way to our destinations. Hyde Park has very enjoyable open spaces to enjoy. There are paths one can walk, stroll. run, bike or gallop.With the vast area being covered, there aren't too many people in any one area and you can truly admire. There are also areas of the park which have monuments or mementos highlighting the life and achievements of the British monarchy and its past.||April 10, 2017
Rose G||50||I loved this park and with the spring flowers out it was very beautiful. There are views of Kensington Palace, Royal Albert Hall. If you are searching for a good coffee in London the cafe by the Italian Gardens will provide one. We explored a little community vegetable garden, saw Clydesdale horses pulling something to cut the grass, numerous squirrels and ducks, geese and white swans on the lakes.This park provides a beautiful place to rest and relax or go for a walk or run. It has both formal gardens and wilder areas.You can combine seeing this park with a visit to Kensington Palace, Royal Albert Hall or the museums near the Hall.||April 10, 2017
CaroleScott||50||While the children ran around blowing off some steam I sat down & thoroughly enjoyed the sunshine, the peace & the people watching!I could have stayed there for hours & hours.Lovely park to enjoyed a walk, picnic, a rest & fun.Carole : )||April 10, 2017

Marcus_surf||50||I am not sure if Hyde Park is the biggest park in London, but it is pretty obvious that it is one of the biggest. What I like about this park is that you can do a lot of things in the area. You can play football with friends, jog around the park, ride the bicycle, or even ride a boat in its ponds. It's a really nice place to enjoy your summer in London and just chill out under the sun (just like how a normal Londoner enjoy some British sunshine).||April 10, 2017
JamesKL14||50||It was great to walk a couple of times across this park. So much beauty on the middle of a city. Walked across the parks to Westminster. ||April 10, 2017

CheekyLondon||50||Went here for a Stroke Association 5K run. Even though I live in East London, I've never really visited Hyde Park and I was pleasantly surprised. The garden areas and flower beds are well tended and there are numerous places to sit, and quite a few cafes for food and drink. I will definitely go back and spend more time here!||April 9, 2017
Frankienorman||50||Spent a few hours here as gorgeous weather and what a great time we had. The park is lovely to walk around and take in all your surroundings.

961SueW||50||Hyde Park stretches for miles. There are footpaths stretching throughout either across the grass, around the water or along the Princess Diana walk. It is a little sanctuary in the city and very popular with dog walkers, families cycling, horse riders and walkers alike. We picnic here quite often when we don't want to sit in a busy eatery elsewhere.||April 9, 2017

SharonB2||40||This is one of several park sin the city. This one sits behind Buckingham Place and comprises 350 acres. It has a large lake, lots of trees and walkways, and beautiful grounds.

Kristyna K||50||Hyde Park stretches from Marble Arch down to Hyde Park Corner and then across to Kensington finishing with Kensington Palace Gardens. In the middle is The Serpentine, a stretch of water that is beautiful. A great place to just stroll about - to sit and rest, eat a take away or organise a family (non bbq) picnic, visit one of the eateries (a bit expensive) take a boat out on the Serpentine, horse ride, skateboard or take in annual Winter Fayre or other festivals. The extended last night of the Proms happens here beginning of September. The Park is dotted with monuments, the most famous being The Albert Memorial.Parks are places of beauty to enjoy and Hyde Park is one of the best! ||April 8, 2017

heavenshull93||40||We walked through both Hyde Park and Kennsington Gardens in one go and it was a very long walk. Beautiful sights the entire way. There was a lot of construction going on at a couple of the walkways, but if you love park nature, you will love this place. Once you get a few yards into the park, the sounds of the busy city surrounding you fades away and it is absolutely peaceful and quiet.||April 8, 2017

I would really recommend a walk in the park to everyone who's passing by.||April 8, 2017
Jenny H||50||This is a wonderful city park enjoyed by locals as much as by tourists. It is worth checking out a map to see if you can walk through it on your way to places such as the V&A or Harrods. It is not to be. Missed. ||April 8, 2017
Sweetican||50||A lovely natural environment in the city!! I went to have a morning run every morning at 6am, very few people in the park, you can enjoy the fresh but cold air, lovely pool view with the ducks and swan were playing in the early morning. Mother duck was teaching baby duck how to find food on the grass, swans were taking a bath... the park is so big, so please don't walk to the wrong exit otherwise you will take long time to find your way back like me >.< I love Hyde Park and it's definitely one of the reasons i will return to London||April 7, 2017

828sebia||40||Hyde Park is a real good choice for the day, although if you're really trying to spend a whole day out in London, it makes sense to use it as a part of the day because of its great location. The park itself is huge, great for cycling, paddling on the boats or just strolling around and chilling. It's benefits come from it's great location, Knightsbridge and South Kensington are only short walks away whilst Buckingham Palace and Westminster are only a bit further. I'd say it's a great choice for a visit in the early afternoon when you're energetic and the weather's at its best, easy to find places to eat and drink. ||April 7, 2017
francop746||40||The whole round to the park takes around 8km and, the park is a very relaxing green area with lots of fresh air. A plus are the buildings that can be seen from it.||April 7, 2017

ClareH2010||50||Lovely park in the centre of London. The pond us full of water birds and boats. The serpentine goes right through, lots of water birds including herons that are happy to sit right by the edge and have their photo taken, as well as pedlos to hire. Some Lovely well maintained gardens within the park, including the flower walk which is very nice. Very busy when it's sunny but room for everyone. ||April 2, 2017
Bima01||50||This is a great big park with Marble Arch and speakers corner at one end and Kensington Palace at the other. In between is miles of walking. Beautiful trees and flowers. Beautiful ponds. There are numerous historical monuments around the park and in the park. These include the one to Prince Albert. This is just a lovely place to spend a sunny day.||April 2, 2017

melindag386||40||We walked through the park to visit Diana, Princess of Wales, Memorial Fountain. The fountain was beautiful. There are quite a few restaurants with outdoor seating in the park. If you use the washrooms at the restaurant then you won't need 20p for the public washrooms. A lot of different types of birds can be found on Serpentine Lake. A nice place to go to.||April 1, 2017
jthompsonrofe||50||You would not know you were in the heart of London - it is peaceful and quiet in Hyde Park.Take a self-guided walk, see memorial and sculptures, including the Holocaust Memorial and Princess Diana's Memorial. See regular events like the Royal Gun salutes, Winter wonderland. See Speakers Corner - the famous site of the feared Tyburn Gallows. Walk along Rotten Row - where upper-class people would exercise their horses.||April 1, 2017
anaisamoreira7||50||This is one of the most beautiful parks in London. Lots to walk, lots to see and lots to enjoy. One of the ways to spend a relaxed sunny afternoon right in the middle of the city.||April 1, 2017
CarrieB33||40||Logged 7 miles strolling around Hyde park from Kensington palace and along the serpentine. Very pleasant away from the noise of central London||April 1, 2017
gabsaint||50||Whether you want to run, jog or just a leisurely walk, Hyde Park is ideal. Feed the ducks on the lake, take in Princess Diana fountain or just sit with a coffee and watch people go by.Great way to spend a day.||March 31, 2017
Ray093||50||We travelled in March and stayed close to Hyde Park on the Bayswater Road side.The weather was excellent and we walked through the park everyday,from Kensington Palace ,to Diana memorial all beautiful way to pass a couple of hours ,would recommend if the suns out and its free||March 31, 2017
ilovedgreece||30||I went here during the winter, on Christmas actually and it was very busy. During the holiday they have a carnival set up that unfortunately wasn’t open on X-mas. I wouldn’t say this park is necessary central but a close enough walk from Piccadilly station and the Ritz hotel. I might suggest going there in the warmer seasons if you are in the area but to be frank I probably wouldn’t go out of my way to visit again.||March 31, 2017
alexgamba002||50||A great place to walk around, rest and just relax in the centre of London that gives you the chance to get away from the busy city and west end.||March 31, 2017
Charlene_Cassar||50||We went there early morning.. serence .. beautiful and quiet.. you can hear the birds.. see the squirrels.. and early joggers ..dog walkers.. the italian fountain.. a beautiful landmark.. it's as if you're in Como Lake in one of the villas, the most beautiful park of Hyde Park in the North Central part of it.,, go there.||March 31, 2017

651arthurr||50||Although having been born in London (South side) I'd never actually visited Hyde Park nor the Kensington Gardens! On the day of my visit it was glorious weather what of course is always very pleasant and cheerful especially in the Spring! All the trees were budding and it looked and felt very awe inspiring!Walked all the way round the Serpentine seeing the Arch of Sir Henry Moore and indeed the fountain memorial for Princess Diana! Lastly the Peter Pan Statue and finally the Isis 'Bird' statue in bronze!An excellent Sunday morning walk!||March 31, 2017
nrm77||50||Great place in the heart of London. It is always well kept, and during spring summer is a lovely place to walk through. Particularly recommend the Italian gardens and the area near Kensington palace.||March 31, 2017
Rosella G||50||What better than a green friend while visiting a big crowded city? Hyde Park is a marvelous place, made of beautiful secular trees, green lawns, flowers, water, ducks, swans, birds, dogs, extravagant people and centuries of history. It has a pleasant restaurant facing the small lake with a desirable menu.A walk in the park is a treat, in any season and weather. Hyde Park is London and reflects the love and care of the English for Beauty and Green.||March 30, 2017
kellm44||40||Very nice place to stop and recommended those who has kids or family gathering. Very clean and nice view. People also very friendly.||March 30, 2017

The weather was great.Its free so enjoy it...take a friend or your loved ones..xx||March 30, 2017
NellCald||50||Hyde Park is a great park to have a nice walk away from the busy streets of London. Kensington Palace is at one end with good gardens to walk round. You can hire bikes or just wander. Visit Peter Pan statue near the pond and don't forget to visit the Princess Diana Memorial. Lovely in the summer when the children all paddle in the water. You can swim in the Lido in the summer too. Good restaurant by water's edge.||March 29, 2017
nitu350||50||Waking up early and taking a stroll in Hyde Park is one of the most relaxing things and is great, especially to get away from the rustle and bustle of the city. Try having breakfast at the cafe by the water - it's a great find!||March 29, 2017
Rob J||50||If you lucky with the weather this is a delightful park to stroll around it is large so you may be there longer than you would think. The boating lake is beautiful and you can hire pedelo's. there are a few refreshment stall and cafes.||March 29, 2017
anna l||40||Gorgeous on the outside and I believed it's even better at the inside. However, it closed early (3pm) for some days of a week. So, better to check before going. ||March 29, 2017

Lambourntraveller||50||Somewhere to escape the hustle and bustle of the City and only a stones throw from the end of Oxford Street.The most wonderful park with the lovely Serpentine and ponds and lakes, among the huge collection of trees, room for everyone to relax picnic and have fun||March 28, 2017
Rosalba P||50||Like most of the large parks in London, this is a very beautiful, well looked after park, with loads of places to seat and enjoy nature, have a picnic, or just relax under a tree... Big fab lake, small shops to buy drinks, coffee, sandwiches, etc (a bit costly compared to major shops- but I guess it goes with the location)... Still amazing park to enjoy... not to be missed! Ps. I Would recommend that you bring all that you want to eat or drink so that the experience isn't costly... ;-)||March 28, 2017
Jan P||50||My husband and I ran in Hyde Park several times during our recent vacation and each time we found a new trail or took in a new sight. Hyde Park is enormous and one can get lost rather easily if you don't know your way. We were happy to get lost in the park since we wanted to rack up some mileage. Fortunately we had fantastic weather (visited in late March) with sunny skies. There are plenty of paths throughout the park and anchor points such as Kensington Palace, Wellington Arch, Speakers' Corner and the Italian Gardens. Don't miss the Serpentine and Princess Diana's Memorial Pond/Fountain. We were very fortunate to go for a run at the same time that the Queen's Household Calvary Mounted Regiment's annual inspection took place in one part of Hyde Park. What an unexpected and exciting sight to see! We enjoyed our run through Hyde Park; a nice place to get away from the city hustle and bustle.||March 28, 2017
056cherylb||40||Today, enjoyed a lovely walk through Hyde Park. The trees are beginning to get new leaves and some are in blossom. We were lucky it was such a sunny day. We enjoyed a coffee and cake near the Italian Gardens. This is a beautiful oasis in the middle of busy London.||March 28, 2017
jcd-pvb||50||Miles of green trails, manicured gardens, horse trails, etc. make this the perfect place for long walk or stroll.||March 28, 2017

Tricia S||50||Hyde Park is beautiful. You could walk for hours. There are so many little spots to check out - the Serpentine, the Princess Diana memorial fountain, many walking trails. We saw people on horseback and others on bikes. If the weather was warmer, it would have been a nice place for a picnic.||March 27, 2017
149jenh||50||This was our first visit to Hyde park. It's a beautiful well kept park. We enjoyed afternoon drinks and the cafe/bar whilst basking in the sunshine and watching the swans ||March 27, 2017

Swim, row, power walk, play football, baseball or just walking with your dog Hyde Park with be perfect for you. A wonderful day away from the hectic world all around it.||March 26, 2017
MrAhmed||50||So big Park. Need hours to see it all. It's so nice for family and lovers. Don't say i have visited London if don't come the Hyde Park.||March 26, 2017
DavidHBlair||50||To be honest we probably walk in Hyde park 30 times per year - all seasons. A great place to walk, in our case our dog. Our favourite walk is around the Serpentine. Every time we go there it is different...it really makes you appreciate the wonderful seasons we have in the UK. It is great to people watch, grab a coffee or just view the latest exhibitions in the 2 excellent Art Galleries.It has been spoilt a bit this year with the unnecessary introduction of cycle hiughways which has ruined the main road through the park which was a fabulous wide boulevard......but London has become obsessed with over provision for cyclists!||March 26, 2017
HanishKataria||50||Very nice place to get lost ;) Beautiful flowers and very well maintained. Could spend entire day in the park||March 26, 2017
MRob62||50||Huge park, lots of joggers, Great Lake in the middle, easy cut through and all the entrances / exits are easy to find, lots of lively trees and shrubs, peaceful there away from the nearby busy roads of the city. ||March 25, 2017
1Sabin||50||We spent a few hours in the Hyde Park . The weather was great so we really enjoyed this amazing open space in the center of London. There are a lot of flowers and birds around the lake. It is amazing and a must see attraction when visiting London.||March 25, 2017
KaciBSM||40||We rented bicycles here and rode through the park. Be careful though! They are VERY serious about sticking to the bicycle routes and some places bicycles cannot go. There is a lot to see in the park and there were many people out and about. There are some places to get a bite to eat or just a quick snack. Also, don't miss Kensington Palace which has it's entrance from the park.||March 25, 2017
Janice K||40||There are lots of acres, lots of green space, and lots of people in Hyde Park. I expected there to be more flowers/garden type areas, but found those to be primarily around the edges of the park. There is a lake area where people come to feed the birds and is an interesting place to people watch. There is a row of embassies along one side of the park, you just see the pack of these buildings from inside Hyde Park. While we were there, the Queen's helicopter landed in a grassy area and delivered a package to one of the embassies. After you leave Hyde Park, it is worth walking around the corner and walking down Embassy Row to see the interesting architecture. Our teenage son is sure that he saw more than $3 million USD of luxury vehicles parked in one of the embassy lots - he was impressed! ||March 25, 2017
Bbestlin||50||The park is really big. We spent about 45 mins walking around. It was perfect Saturday in London with the blue sky and sunlight! Actually, you can spend long time at this place. It was so relaxing place. I felt refreshing after walking around. The scenery is nice. If you love taking photos, here is the place you can find lots of good spots. I do love this place in London and I will visit again next time!||March 25, 2017
Zuhair A||50||My family & I spend some time at the park where we walked & played some football. We loved it. the park is clean, safe & well organized. I it is a great free day to spend with the family. Kids will love the clean grass. ||March 25, 2017
hawkdaddy23||30||The largest royal park in London with nearly a square mile footprint. Great spot to take a stroll and relax and enjoy the warm weather (seasonally) and the water courses and swans and ducks. Speakers Corner at the park is a popular spot for "soapbox" speeches and political debates. Historically this included Winston Churchill in the pre electronic media days. Certainly worth a few minutes stop during your tour of London.||March 24, 2017
4leaflondon||50||Unbelievable amount of vast open space in the centre of London. Somewhere to relax and refresh and stretch your legs and take in lengths of beautiful grass. Perfect ||March 24, 2017
lonely2014||40||This walk is good for any time of the year. One passes the Serpentine which has an excellent café ,Numerous types of birds are on and around the lake and the wild flowers in the park are superb .||March 24, 2017

Toni L||40||Always enjoy walking Hyde Park . The birdlife are so tame and welcome you next to the waters edge, spotting the horses on their ride out, the dogs enjoying freedom, Diana's playground for toddlers, High Tea at the Organisery.... lovely!||March 22, 2017
Selvenar||50||Hyde Park is a gorgeous public space in the center of Kensington. This sprawling park has monuments to some of Britain's most famous royals and more wildlife than one could dream of... all in the heart of one of the best cities in the Western Hemisphere. You would be doing yourself a great disservice if you did not visit this park once during your stay in London.||March 22, 2017
Blueberry31210||50||We walked the park on a cold, rainy, dreary day and we loved it. So many dogs and people enjoying the park. ||March 22, 2017
RevjohnC||50||It was so nice to leave the roar if the London traffic behind and enjoy the gardens, trees and the cool lapping water of the Serpentine. You can boat, feed the geese and the swans, even swim if you want to, and there are good cafes/ restaurants to relax in. The plane trees and the sandy carriage drives remind you of a bygone age of horses, Hansom cabs, and top hats. Enjoy!||March 22, 2017
wiseguy1282005||30||I have been to a few parks in the world. Hyde park may well be one of the biggest ones.However those birds and green did not appeal to me as "must see" attraction.||March 22, 2017
elenajamie||50||This is not only one of the iconic places in london it is really the spirit of the city ,lovely and full of life and flower in winter or summer||March 22, 2017

94karimr||40||This is the icon of parks in London...its massive , there are different trails path ways to follow, walking lane , cycling lane and horse riding lane ....there is a lot of sporting activities to do.the lake features different boating activities, duck and swan feeding ...there are a number of food kiosk scattered through th park and 2-3 restaurant cafes ...the park is best visited when its a nice sunny day as people are out and about and there is a buzz||March 21, 2017
Sylvia5083||50||I have never been anywhere where so many different species of birds are all in one place. If you bring food, dozens literally flock to you! A few patrons handing out bread and birdseeds almost bit off more than they could chew. Adults, it may be wise to let the children watch instead of feeding as some of these swans are rather large and are not shy.My husband and I planned on stopping by Hyde Park in the late afternoon for about an hour but instead ended up staying watching the birds for a two solid hours and one walking the rest of the grounds. The gray squirrels were also not shy to climb on you if you have food but please be careful!I am definitely glad we took time out of our travel schedule to visit even though the temperatures were roughly between 30-40 degrees Fahrenheit in early February.||March 21, 2017
Xe96||40||Hyde Park is absolutely massive and completely surrounded by fencing so is a safe place to let your kids run free. There are a few things to do there, such as see the Albert Memorial, look at the Serpentine (and Serpentine Gallery) or the fountains, visit the Peter Pan statue, visit Kensington Palace, or feed the escaped parakeets. Without children, it would take you about half an hour to cross from north to south, assuming you aren't dawdling, so it is easy to fill lots of time there. However, on a rainy day, it would be pretty miserable.||March 20, 2017
Talycat||50||We went through Hyde Park on a beautiful sunny day. It was amazing. And so fun to see all the people out and about in London. ||March 19, 2017
nathan-gladwell||50||Must see if visiting London, one of Londons best parks, very central, love the nature and the lake. Great for boating and long walks. ||March 19, 2017
blessedbymoore||50||We stayed in Hyde Park Gate which is across the street from Kensington Palace in Hyde Park. Each morning we walked the park and explored the beauty of each area. There are monuments and gorgeous trees. The paths are either paved or dirt packed and the park is beautifully cared for and manicured. If you have to use the restroom it will cost you between 20 and 50 pence. The park is used for recreational sports, exercising , picnics, strolls, bike riding, walking your furry pets and I'm sure so much More. Be careful of you go on a long walk. You might lose your way. The park is 625 acres. If you lose your way of your GPS acts up just find someone with a British accent and they will help you. ||March 19, 2017
Denise P||50||Situated right in the centre of london, this makes any commute on foot a joy. The birds especially. Where did these parakeets come from? Why are they here? They make it all the more special. ||March 19, 2017
Jolanta A||50||It's one of my favourite place in London. Greenery in early February is really amazing and wonderful, sometimes you can meet horse parade training and a lot of runners. It's like oasis full of peace in the middle of noisy city, I love it!||March 19, 2017
Luiza C||50||Very big and nice park. Very well looked after,always clean and tidy.Lots of local people come everyday for a walk and also place is popular for tourists. Dont miss it out as it is in city center and easy accessible from different entrances ||March 19, 2017
cmccgw||50||A massive park in the middle of London.I went for a run down the famous Rotten Row - if you love to run, walk, people watch Then Hyde Park has it all. Beautiful sculptures, fountains & gardens.Fantastic to see the horse riders too.||March 19, 2017
767nickt92||50||Hyde Park has to be one of the best underdog experience of my Honeymoon. The park is big, beautiful and welcoming. Birds, dogs, you name it, they're walking free. If that isn't for you, I would try to avoid anywhere near the fountains or lake. This park offers an "Alternative" London. A must see.||March 19, 2017
AdmiralGanteaume||50||Was taking a run through Kensington and Hyde Parks when I spied what seemed to be part of a horserace track parallel to High Street. Of course when I got to the end, there was no "turn" to complete an oval, but I ran along it on the grass and finally ran into a sign designating it as "Rotten Row." When I returned to the flat we'd rented, I looked it up and read its history. If you're not familiar, google it. Material Culture from the 17th century, at its best, right in the middle of London.||March 19, 2017
Emmy2005||50||Hyde park is beautiful even in early spring, the daffodils and crocuses in bloom. We wanted to find Peter Pan and on our walk we found so much more. The Queens horse guards over 200 of them were walking through the side of the park to honor a general. We found exotic birds in a tree, apparently some London parks have these. We found Peter Pan and a Rolls Royce ice cream truck. The other people walking were friendly and enjoying the day and the sights. So go take a walk you never know what you might find there.||March 19, 2017
DavidVeb||50||The park is huge and there are a lot of things to do. Me and my friend rented bikes here and made the most of a sunny day. You can visit the Diana memorial here and there are exibitions here as well. There are lots of biking check post in and around the park. Place to eat are available as well.||March 19, 2017

Must see, walk and visit. There is always a lot to do. Have a beautiful walk accross the park for hours. Feed the swans, squirrels, go to the lovely care right by the lake, go see Kensington gardens and Kensington palace where Princess Diana and Prince William and Harry grew up. ||March 15, 2017
KulHKJ||50||I went for a lunchtime stroll and it turned out to be a nice sunny afternoon. There is plenary to see and do from boating to art galleries in the park. There is parking within the park and this starts at 35p per 25 minutes. The whole area is safe and som really nice areas to sit and watch the world go by. Disabled parking is somewhat limited or get there early. The walks are breathtaking and should be enjoyed. ||March 15, 2017
Eva K||50||whether you're heading for an early morning run (keeno), a lunchtime walk, an evening stroll, a gym session, a skateboard lesson, a picnic, a frizbee session, a 420 rally, a festival whammy... Hyde Park is a center of calm for Londoners and travellers alike. ||March 15, 2017
HDTsele||50||It''s a wonderful park. We visited for our small breakfast by the lake, coffee and cigarette. And because it is clean and peaceful you have to think on where to throw your cigarette butts! Definitely you have to see the Diana, Princess of Wales, Memorial Fountain. Just hear the water running while you look at the lake...||March 15, 2017

adelinul2000||50||If you visited enough in London, and by chance there is a sunny day, than I definitely recommend you Hyde park. People are : jogging, waling, playing all sort of sports, visiting the castle. Any way you put it, it's definitely a place for sunny days.||March 14, 2017

pepsimark||50||Staying very near the park, I took an early morning walk every day just as the sun came up. This glorious park is even better at this time of day.||March 12, 2017
02012017||50||It is the heart of contemporary London. When it's sunny it's gorgeous and tranquil. You'll be enjoying slow walk watching people jogging and walking out their cute dogs and restless funny kids. The best place to get out of your fast paced life full of stress and troubles and slow down and think about things that really matter :) ||March 12, 2017
Leslieb20160805||50||Serpentine Lake was filled with regal swans. Speakers' Corner was fun to see, although no one was blustering. The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain was a sight to behold. A great excuse to walk even in wet weather. ||March 12, 2017
carolinnebaltazar||50||This park makes you feel in a dream. So beautiful with the green and flowers! It is so big and close to the queen's castle. Try it! Spend a morning or a sunset there. It will be one of most relaxing moments in your life!||March 12, 2017
SADIA A||50||I love to go to the Hyde Park. Always stay around the Hyde Park area so that I can visit the park almost everyday and pass though it and enjoy the weather.||March 12, 2017
AironetBoy||50||As the title suggests , it really is a wonderful place to take an early morning stroll before breakfast as you can see the monuments etc before it gets busy and it is also peaceful and quiet , not withstanding the pounding of trainers and the heavy breathing of the people within those trainers.Fortunately my hotel was directly opposite Lancaster Gate entrance , so was easy to get to the Park. There are many cross roads within the park , but they are clearly signposted.One of the highlights is the Albert Memorial , just opposite the Royal Albert Hall. When the sun is shining and there is no-one about , a fantastic photo opportunity.||March 12, 2017
Indiantraveller3012||40||Really big public par. It took e one and a half hour from one end to another. Get down at Kensington garden station. After visiting V&A MUSEUM you can walk through the park to the other station. Hyde park is opposite to the museum.||March 12, 2017
AshvinG18||50||Originally from one of the noisiest cities Mumbai, this was a treat. To walk, run or even meditate is perfect for the soul searcher. The mornings are best as there a few people and the stretch will keep you walking and you will not even realise that you completed 5 km. Visit london and do this once.||March 11, 2017
bb20001||50||We hired bikes but were disappointed that there are so many paths that you can't ride on with the bike. ||March 11, 2017

CaravanDad||40||This is a large park in central London with fields, tree lined lanes, water features and gardens within in. Full of people, but not crowded. Closest tube stations are: Marble Arch, Hyde Park Corner and Queensway. It's a great diversion from the crowds of Oxford Street.||March 10, 2017
streakey||50||This is one of the most extensive of Londons Royal Parks and one that is used for so many differing occasions such as concerts and the Winter Wonderland extravaganza that seems to get bigger every yearHave a walk around here or there are joggers, dog walkers, cyclists or just people resting here for a while ||March 10, 2017

Warwick A||50||This is a must for any person that visits or lives in London. Large park that also has great events during the year (Winter Wonderland, Bristish Summer Time etc) but also nice for a bit of a run or just great to grab a coffee and stroll through. A must visit||March 10, 2017
jaybeeFL||50||Beautifully landscaped, colorful gardens, impeccably maintained to name just a few of the attributes of this huge green space located in the center of one of the world's largest and classiest metropolises. Take several hours and give it a jaunt, or try one of the many activities available. Rent a rowboat, ride a horse, take a whirl on a bike---so many options. Well worth a morning or afternoon in such a beautiful place!||March 10, 2017
882amirr||50||One of the London's symbolic places that must be visited in any season. Hyde Park is a beautiful park at the heart of London. It's connected to most famous streets in Europe and always there are some events there! I highly recommend visiting hyde park corner.||March 10, 2017
LukeGilham||50||Beautiful, my experience of Hyde Park was a magnificant one and each and everyone of you reading this should head down when the weather is warm (or even chilli) but when the sun is shining! I went last April to visit my sister when we had that heat wave and we walked from the busier city to the park, I felt I was abroad in my own country, people were rolling blading, playing frisbee, families were playing cricket and there were swans on the Lake. Honestly, it was just AHHHHHH, brilliantly beautiful, if I haven't won you over in that small description this should grab you. The weather was stunning and warm and to top it off a Spitfire flew over, NOW, I am not saying a Spitfire flies over every time but even so! Take a picnic with the family and sit yourself down and enjoy the park, it is an odd situation because in the distance you can see the big corporate buildings that fill the skyline, but this doesn't take away from the beautiful trees, birds, boats and people of the park. Any questions don't hesitate to contact me :) ||March 10, 2017
Tamw0rth2||50||A good place to relax - amazingly quiet when away from the roads. Plenty to see and do around the Serpentine, quiet a variety of aquatic birds. We found the snack bars to be very good value for a light lunch and Ice Cream!||March 10, 2017
yelenabondarev||50||If you want a break from the bussle of London grab some food and head into Hyde Park. You can spend hours just looking at the gardens. They are like a botanical garden.||March 9, 2017
alex_hopcroft||50||Took our 2 year old to Diana's memorial for an airing but unfortunately it closed early so we had a wonder across the park (which felt like miles btw) to the Winter Wonderland Fair, it was amazing. So many great stalls, rides. Excellently planned, laid out and managed. Will definitely be going back!||March 9, 2017
beckyybrown||50||Lovely park, very nice on a sunny day to walk around and look at the gardens. We walked around the outskirts and then hired the bikes to ride around as well. Free entry into the park and a cheap price to hire the bikes as well. ||March 9, 2017

ecbamber||50||Walking through the park, seeing the peaceful mist over the Serpentine is calming and gives you a gentle start to the day.Stopping for a coffee , or resting on an park bench allows you some quiet time to reflect .Savoir the moments.....||March 8, 2017
KBY23||50||I spend lots of time in Hyde Park whenever I am in London. It is beautiful with good variety for a quiet walk, a run, or just relaxing with a coffee watching the birds at the serpentine cafe. The cafe by the Italian garden is also really pleasant. ||March 8, 2017

Roysreef||50||Whenever I find myself in London I'm drawn to this park. In almost any weather its a peaceful place to spend some time.. It has so much to offer with bikes for rent, paddle boats on the pond or a horseback ride. I love to go for a morning run here. It seems to be a place where tourists and locals can co-mingle and enjoy the outdoors. ||March 7, 2017
p0werpixie||50||This park is awesome. It's a great walk and it's always lovely to see other families out for a stroll and people walking their dogs. ||March 7, 2017

Cooper T||50||Had a nice peaceful walk through hide park and saw lovely wildlife and squizes (squirrels) thoroughly enjoyed ||March 5, 2017
NikkiTKS||40||I first visited Hyde park for BST when the libertines were playing and the security was terrible. They allowed far too many people into the front area and many were getting crushed and knocked over when the band were playing.The band had to tell people several times to step back and stop climbing posts and barriers and lots of people including myself were pulled over the barrier and allowed out of the side. Whatever possessed them to gate people in like that without a route out of there I don't know.However when I went the next year to see The Who it was very differently laid out and it seemed lessons had been learned which was good to see.I'm going back again this summer for green day and am looking forward to it :) ||March 5, 2017
Tjoergensen||50||Excellent and nice park for a good walk. Good for familiies with children. The park is clean and a good place to have a picnic also ||March 5, 2017

MMM1968||50||We walked from the horse guard building through the park to get to Buckingham Palace. The park is huge with a lot of waterfowl and friendly squirrels who will gladly accept any peanuts you have to offer! Flowers were just starting to bloom so I'm sure it's much prettier in the spring!||March 4, 2017
haverill08||50||Beautiful walks around the lake. Can be quite busy, especially as we went when Winter wonderland was on!||March 4, 2017

ericon991||40||Makes an nice spot for a walk if it is dry. The Serpentine is an interesting body of water, I cannot undersand how it can ever be available for swimming due to the number of birds polluting the water. Nice cafes and paths to wander at leisure. Recommended. ||March 4, 2017
ironmaiden76||50||I always tend to go for a stroll on the last morning im visiting in london. I like sitting on the deck chairs and people watching, then walking around the poets corner and hearing the stories. Normally see a few famous faces out and about jogging.||March 4, 2017

arthurldn||20||The landscaping team didn't spend a lot of time planning this park. It's flat, the views are non-existent, it's overall quite boring...||March 3, 2017
Paulwang127||40||Unlike Central Park in New York, London has more than just Hypark as their only piece of greenery. Walking into the park immediately takes you to another time. Beautiful gardens and old timer building are what you see as you walk along the lively water ponds. You can jog, ride a bike or run as you please. Inside the park you can visit Diana's Memorial Playground if you have kids and both Kensington Palace and Serpentine Gallery are a easy walk to the west. The location is simply fantastic and if you are staying in the Marble Arch or the SOHO area, a visit to this park is a must.||March 3, 2017
mattgoodheart||50||Of all the parks on earth Hyde Park is my favorite. It just seems there is something for everyone including birds that will land on your arms for food..if you stand still long enough. And there is always the Swan across the street...read my review on that Cosy pub.||March 3, 2017
Rachel O||40||We had an amazing cream tea at the little cafe and a walk, not much more to say, it's green, spacious and a lake.||March 3, 2017
Jane J||50||Hyde Park is one of London's great open spaces and is hard to believed you are in the centre of a such a big city. It's well maintained, has beautiful flower gardens and hard paths everywhere, ideal for prams, buggies, wheelchairs and those who have difficult in walking on uneven ground. ||March 2, 2017

Vasa-Eriksson||30||Take a moment from city life in a green dream. A beautiful traditional british park. Have a picknick feed/don't feed the squirrels & just enjoy life and the atmosphere.||March 2, 2017
EAA111||40||On a good day, I like to walk through the park to get to work and back. The mornings are usually my favorite time of day to walk in the park; people walk their dogs, colleagues meet to walk together, friends talk about their week or weekend, people cycle to work... It's lively and it's an amazing way to wake up. You can walk close to the serpentine and see people feeding the ducks or swimming. If you'd like to escape the business of London every day, I'd recommend a few minutes in the park; it's revigorating. ||March 2, 2017
m86rich||50||One of the greatest parks in London. Such a beautiful place in all seasons. Hyde park has so many different areas to walk around. It's a great place to sit and read, take a trip on the serpentine or just sit in the sun. During the spring and summer months you're much more likely to see wildlife.||March 2, 2017

marciat455||40||This is a nice place to go for a scenic run. My colleague and I chose this park because we do not enjoy running on the streets of London.Considering it is February and freezing cold I was surprised to see a lot of people in the park enjoying the attractions.I liked running around the lake. The paths were wide so we could run around the strollers. The views were nice too. The park is huge so I am sure there is a lot more to see and do apart from running. I plan to try the boats in the summer.||February 26, 2017
NoemiZecchini||50||Our hotel was near this stunning place and so it was the first park we visited in London. Romantic and very good to spend some time into it.

dianepb||50||It feels as though you are in the country yet you are in the middle of a huge city. So peaceful, you can find walkways and pathways where there are very few people or you can be in the midst of it all as you walk the Serpentine. There were joggers galore out as a race was organised but it didn't detract from walking for a couple of hours in the cold fresh sunshine . Take a trip to Kensington Palace or speakers corner, sit on a bench and read a book , watch the squirrels and the birds etc Enjoy!||February 25, 2017
Pauline K||40||Great if you want a bit of fresh air and a break from the car fumes. Lake, walkways and bridle path. Good for a stroll or to join the joggers around the park.||February 24, 2017

RobbieHumphries||50||My wife and I went on our first date in Hyde park, an afternoon on the pedelos and then lots of rolling around in the long grass. The park is huge and has so many different bits. If it's sunny it might get busy but you will always find your spot.  Good for a walk, run, cycle, just a lazy day. Even a swim in the Serpentine, But don't use goggles, it's kind of better not to know what your swimming in!||February 24, 2017
joannakiii||50||One of the best parks i've ever visited! My sister lives nearby and everytime i am in London i am crossing this park almost everyday!

William S||50||Comming to London in the winter, don't miss Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park! A wonderland full of Christmas dreams.This was my first ever time visiting the Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. One of my favourite parks to walk around ever in London. The amount of people to walk through the theme park is immensely exciting.You will find everything that you can think of from ice rinks, to rollercoasters, to haunted houses, to gigantic wheels, to incredible theatre performances. Now be prepared to spend ALOT of money but hey you are on vacation! There is something for everyone of all ages from ice skating to rollercoasters to an awesome ice bar! Yes, those glasses are also made of ice!||February 23, 2017
CheeKoonL1||50||It will never go wrong to get some fresh air at the park after visiting the museum and the gallery. Good historical stuffs can sometimes make us feel heavy :-DWalk your steps along the Jubilee Walkway which consists of several loops, you can see great monuments, historical buildings and beautiful gardens like Hyde Park and Green Park and St James Park.I wish I could have the chance to visit those parks in different seasons of the year.The memorial fountain of Princess Diana is a must to visit!||February 22, 2017
ashleypendrak||50||Lovely for an afternoon walk with friends to escape the city. Stroll around and find various monuments and sculptures like the 7/11 memorial, Diana Memorial Playground, and Peter Pan statue. Hard to believe it's in the middle of central London! ||February 22, 2017

I always take some nuts to feed the squirrels as they as unbelievably tame. Great place for dogs and when the sun's out grab a deck chair and enjoy the rays. In summer this park hosts various concerts and in winter there's the lovely Winter Wonderland to visit! Very well maintained!!||February 21, 2017
Pechfoodlover||40||We strolled through Hyde Park in the middle of summer and the grass was looking a little tired but Londoners and tourists alike were enjoying the beautiful warm weather. Definitley a worthwhile thing to do.||February 21, 2017
Runierrr||50||Great getaway from noises and crowds of the city (in the middle of a city). Lots of space to walk around, lots of birds, fresh air (as a London standard). Public toilets around the park. There's also couple of cafes.||February 21, 2017
kellykat98||40||I am absolutely taken by London but I can honestly say one of the best things I have ever done in the city was spend an afternoon strolling around Hyde Park. We decided to pick up some picnic food at the deli counters of Harrods (The brownie is highly recommended) before walking here and sitting by the lake. Everybody was out enjoying the sunshine, eating barbecue food, riding skateboards etc. We watched the squirrels running around and having a good time and attempted to find the Diana memorial fountain but got completely lost so perhaps some better signage would be useful. On a whole though if it's too hot to spend hours wandering round the palace and south bank this is a good option!||February 21, 2017
Vivelafrancetoday||50||I remember someone once gave, on Trip Advisor, Ben Nevis 1*. To give Hyde Park any less than 5* would be unthinkable. Ok... so if you don't like great parks such as this you could be unimpressed (so don't go there). But for the rest of us, this is a fantastic place. I quite like birds... and saw: herons, cormorants, Egyptian geese (had to Google them), green parrots...My partner like art galleries. We both like coffee and cake and agreed The Magazine was great. Diana's memorial fountain/water feature is great. Very imaginative use of water and levels and surfaces (I'd have been quite happy to have her around still and not have the memorial, but that's another matter.) There is a Henry Moore sculpture. Italian gardens. The Albert memorial. The list goes on and on. Great place to spend an hour, or a day, or a life. ||February 21, 2017
Bonestorm109||50||Ill keep this plain and simple....Hyde Park is a MUST if you visit London. Its simply Gorgeous regardless of the weather both in the day and at night. it has everything to keep you busy for the day. You can take a rowing boat or peddle out onto the lake, swim in the lake during the summer season, hire wheelie ski's, go running, have breakfast, lunch or dinner, ride a bike (Plenty of NO CYCLING areas), have an ice cream. Lots of Cafes and stalls etc...Its an amazing atmosphere it really is. Can not recommend it enough!!!||February 21, 2017
962steve||50||this is one of the most relaxing walks ive ever had walking in hyde park,the lake is superb and kept clean by the park keepers ,theres lots to do I personaly fed the swans and ducks but as usual the little birds and squirrels got in on the act to so when id finished with the birds I called in the café for twenty minutes for a coffee and slice of cake before continuing my journey around the lake , the thing that made it more enjoyable was it was a suuny day but a little chilly, I would definatly recommend this walk||February 21, 2017
angel_w_20142014||40||In my opinion this is the best park in London, as their is something for everyone. We came with our young child, who loved feeding the ducks and having a run around in Diana memorial gardens, plus having a photo next to the Peter Pan Statue! There is a cafe on site and a section of lake which you can swim in during the summer. ||February 21, 2017
MoBs167||40||Large popular park in the heart of London very popular with locals and tourists alike. So understandably gets very busy. Lots to see and do and enjoy a stroll when the sun is out. ||February 21, 2017
BobBobGolden||40||A very large park, only walk across the southern part. Very well maintained. Big trees, green lawn, gardens with flowers, squirrels.....Lot of people enjoying themselves with all sorts of activities.Excellent to relax with greens in a big city.||February 21, 2017

Noholife||50||A beautiful green park to stroll around, picnic, run or whatever pleases you. The round pond has lots of swans and they are beautiful ||February 20, 2017
Patrycjaa0||50||Hyde Park is the best park in London I have ever been to. The park is really big which means that there is a lot of different things to do there. The duck ride is quite expensive, to be honest.||February 20, 2017
chez1202||50||Wowsa loved just strolling in here biggest trees and leaves of an old park and squirrels everywhere... beautiful part of London ||February 20, 2017
dirtman22||50||Beautiful early spring day in Hyde Park. The park is well manicured and a great escape from the nearby city life. Just one caution: Watch for bikes as you cross the many paths! On a beautiful day, I'd recommend a pint at the lodge. I felt very safe in the park and a pint at the lodge is the perfect place to rest.||February 20, 2017
Z3209AAbrunos||50||An enormous park with space for just about anything. You can walk all day along the pathways, or the Serpentine, or rent a boat and paddle around on it, or bike through it. Great gardens at the south east corner as you cross into Green Park.Highly recommended.||February 20, 2017
865aarons||50||A nice park to take a walk through on a sunny day. lots of wildlife around the pond and in the trees. ||February 20, 2017
Theo P||50||Definitely in my top-3 London parks, it's up there with Crystal Palace, and Walpole. It's very big and ironically there aren't many good places to hide. So maybe not the best for a game of 'Hyde' and seek!||February 20, 2017
Tulah77||50||We enjoy a spot of sunshine whilst strolling around Hyde park. The park is very large, could do with a few more sign posts along the way. Loves watching the waterfowl in and around the serpentine. Stopped at the lido cafe and toilet break with the little one. Looking forward to taking a boat out during the summer.||February 19, 2017
FeuerGehirn||40||It's a beautiful park sure, but I just feel most of the other parks in London are just better. Walk through it if it's on the way. ||February 19, 2017
LadyCatling||40||If you want a break from the hustle of the city, this is the place to go! Was lovely to sit on the bench on a sunny day in February and watch the birds on the water. Places to get hot/cold drinks, pedalos to rent out, long walks, sculptures and views of city - perfect! Albert memorial is one you wouldn't want to miss too opposite the Royal Albert Hall.||February 19, 2017
aybene2014||40||People riding horses,throwing rocks to the lake,watching the swans,playing at the Memorial Park for Diana with the kids.A memorable outdoor activity with the kids||February 18, 2017

Melinda T||50||It's nice to walk in HYde Park, I had my friends to visit me for a week, we decided it stay in London for 3 days! I love Hyde park, we used to walk for hours with my partner! Hides away the traffic, but it's also busy with families and tourists ||February 18, 2017
Cabulihan||50||The park was beautiful even though it was winter. It was freezing that day but there were many tourists and locals. I saw many locals walking their dogs and jogging around the park. I cannot wait to visit it again this summer.||February 18, 2017
sianf27||50||I came here for a weekend away for my boyfriends birthday. When winter wonderland was there. I love Hyde park and all the surrounding areas. Would come here anytime! Lovely place ||February 18, 2017
MinervaBB||50||Always a great place to spend some time. To relax, having a few drinks or enjoy a bit of sun, this location on the west side of London is ideal for a little escape. ||February 18, 2017
Rubaiyat E S||40||Lovely enormous royal park in the center of London. Stunning and beautifully maintained park. Wonderful place to escape from city and have a solitary walk. With a big lake in the middle,water bikes, lot of green spaces, bushes, trees, food stalls and what not, absolutely amazing for outing on a sunny day. The serpentine is a pleasant area to sit by and you should not forget the beautiful Italian Gardens at the Bayswater road side of the park. The gardens near by the Albert memorial is regularly maintained. Lovely memorials, statues and fountains. Hyde parks neighbours are Kensington Gardens, Green Park and St. James' Park, really worth a visit.||February 18, 2017

Gayle E||50||Spent a good portion of the day just wandering throug the park. Wildlife and interesting little parkettes with statuary, ponds and other interesting features throughout. Even in November, still enjoyed it!||February 16, 2017
148nigelm||50||A fantastic contrast between the frantic pace of the busy streets and the apparent rural feel of the wide open spaces there is always a quiet corner for everyone or if you prefer outdoor activities The nature was a surprise with ducks geese and even parrots ||February 16, 2017
mmm123385||50||this place is truely a breath of fresh air, I love to catch a couple of hours here when I come to London. I feel its like the heart of London and there's always something going on. There's so much to see including the Diana memorial and a walk over to Speakers Corner is a must but a simple walk around the park or a picnic on the grass is just as much fun. There are lots of cafes and kiosks for drinks and snacks and you can find places that offer a full sit down meal. ||February 16, 2017
Barbara V||50||Try to avoid rainy days, because this is the perfect spot to go for long walks in your own or with your friends. I personally prefer to take my headphone and Ipod and explore on my own. It's very peaceful. ||February 16, 2017

TopTravelerUK||40||Hyde park is a great escape from the city inside the city! It's quite big park with green lands, river walks. In the winter not so great unless you like being outside on the cold. This is the perfect place to go get get outside and go for a walk with the children and dogs. Walk down by the river and feed the ducks. In the summer vast areas to have a picnic and play footy or catch with the kids. It can get busy in the summer days with dog walkers and joggers. If your in London and wants an escape from all that hustle and bustle without living the city this is the place. ||February 16, 2017
nicknmks||50||Love taking my dog there for a walk.I Can go for hours very well maintained and always feels safe.Plenty of cafes and toilets so you can spend all your day walking around||February 15, 2017

BarneyBulgin||40||Lovely big park. Lots of big open spaces near lots of famous landmarks. Lots of joggersFelt very safe during the dayLacking in toilets though||February 13, 2017
Nucleusman||40||A walk by the Serpentine on a cold winter's day is only relieved by a meal in one or other of the snack bars or restaurants. The food is not cheap but what do you expect as a captive walker in one of London's great parks complete with river views and thousands of birds?||February 13, 2017
Mark T||40||Hyde park is a big park in London. It's very nice. There are trees and pretty much everything else you would expect to see in a park. So if you were considering going to this place then looked up TripAdvisor to see what the reviews were saying... well then, I'm not so sure what type of person you are.||February 13, 2017
Matteo T||50||This is the epitome of an English park. A must-see if you're a tourist and a favorite spot if you're a local like me. The only downsize is that it can get really cold on a wind day.||February 13, 2017
Nigel H||50||Hyde park is a beautiful space to fine peace and quiet from the chnoise and chaos of the London streets. The park is beautifully maintained, clean and so pretty. The lake which occupies the central area is a delight to walk around and for the brave there is even a section reserved for those brave swimmers who are willing to risk the freezing water. Free entry at all times and a must for anyone staying in London for a few days!||February 12, 2017
Sethuraman0025||50||Nature at its best .A huge park with a lot of options to indulge with the nature .Greenery all over , flock of swans when you go neat the water area and where boating is also well recommended .Can be a very good spot for picnic .

Andy W||50||The park is beautiful, especially in the summer. Amazing wildlife! You can spend hours strolling around or just having a good rest! It's great for picnic as well. It can look pretty depressing in the winter but a good place to visit nonetheless!||February 12, 2017
Lasa88||50||there is always something to see in Hyde Park. In the morning the queens horses are excercised here which is fun to watch, as well as some private horses, there are swams and ducks to feed and a generally nice, relaxing atmosphere.||February 11, 2017
Apollinaireeee||50||Such an amazing green space in the city! I was lucky enough to hand-feed a squirrel some money-nuts, and someone showed me a video of a parakeet landing on their hand in hope of food! So much wildlife! Can be quite busy, but thats expected for the city!||February 11, 2017

OZS_ATW||40||I took a walk from the Paddington Railway Station to Hyde Park.It was a huge open space park but somehow it seemed a little bleak. I liked the Italian Gardens very much but to be honest Central Park is still my undisputed champion in NYC.||February 7, 2017

Ros24Dec||30||To go only if you have a lot of spare time. Otherwise, a place you could skip. It looks just like any other normal Parks with not much attraction but maybe a good place to observe how the locals live probably better in other season than winter. ||February 7, 2017

bluedawggy||40||Visit the park to relax in the middle of the city. One of the Royal Parks it sits close to Buckingham Palace and the Mall. It hosts the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain as well as numerous walks through the park. A lovely way to spend the morning looking out for the squirrels who call the park their home. The Serpentine is the long lake which divides the park. Combine the park with a visit to the Royal Albert Hall or Museum of Natural History as they are closeby.||February 6, 2017

Kanga423||50||I walked through this park every day of my most recent trip because my hotel was so close. I loved walking through because you never knew what you'd see, if it would just be nature or people walking their dogs or putting together a pickup game of football. The park is HUGE, honestly I almost got lost a couple of times. But all in all a gorgeous park.||February 5, 2017
Caroline M||50||We stayed in a hotel beside Hyde Park but unfortunately the window was too high up to see the views. The weather was fantastic and the park wasn't overcrowded. ||February 5, 2017

Londongirljo||50||Hyde park is a lovely stroll. In the summer, its nice to have a picnic here. Free entry. There is a restaurant in the park which serves decent food and drinks too. I like the entry point near Mandarin Oriental in Knightsbridge, not as crowded compared to Hyde Park Corner. ||February 3, 2017
Andrewab312||50||I went there late at night, when there were almost no lights on in the park. I walked around and enjoyed the view, mostly shades. It looked very impressive, quite big, and even though it was cold and one of the lakes was frozen, people were all around, mainly exercising, and even though it was terribly dark, it felt safe! I enjoyed my night stroll there!||February 3, 2017
Mike B||50||My partner wanted to re-visit, my first time. Despite the chilly weather it was a great, interesting, gentle walk around the Serpentine. Loads & loads of bird life, how strange to see naturalised paraquettes. Lovely little café at the Italian garden end of the serpentine. Nice to see all the tidying up and maintenance work going on.Well worth a visit. ||February 3, 2017
LL156||50||Wonderful for lots of different events or just to stroll around when nothing is going on. The views of it from a certain hotel are stunning||February 2, 2017

John D||50||I love this park, because it has enough space for many people. You can sit in private and still seeing a lot of people. And it's also a great spot for festivals.||February 2, 2017
Andy T||50||After a long day in the busy city centre, it was a really good idea to just sit on the bench by the lake and watch the ducks minding their own business.The place is big and isolates you quite nicely from the city's rush, while still being easy to reach by feet from the city centre. Feels like a central park! A world within a world.Definitely worth the visit||February 2, 2017
nytraveller2020||50||There are so many different regions of the park to explore - be prepared for hours of walking to see the park and so bring a picnic (if walking from Soho, enjoy the walk down Oxford Street and stop in at Marks and Spencer for takeaway). Special areas include Speakers Corner, Still Water (the horse's head), the Serpentine, the July 7 London bombing memorial, as well as the famous memorials to Princess Diana and Prince Albert. If winter carnival is being put up (early nov?), wooden walls block off the middle of the park and it's time consuming to walk around, so plan ahead. ||February 1, 2017
Lisanne10n||40||Hyde park is one of the largest royal parks in London. It merges with Kensington Gardens. It is awesome for a lovely walk and relaxation. There is a lot to see in the park including a Princes Diana memorial. ||February 1, 2017
TR6-KID||50||It's only a park, but IS used for big events, I suppose you'd review them separately, it's a nice area of walks, you can stroll the paths, hire a Boris Bike, have a run. It's also a nice break if you are going to various attractions - Apsley House one end, Kensington Palace the other for instance. There's also the Serpentine Gallery. Note: Closed Mondays. A little bit of nature in the city. Go.||February 1, 2017
BeritN_13||50||We went for a walk in the park from Lancaster gate and southwards. Halfway we saw a small green parrot, and stopped to watch it. Suddenly more birds arrived, and in some minutes there were about 20 green parakeets! They were not afraid of humans and stepped on visitors hands to be handfed! Great experience!||February 1, 2017

millie t||50||Enjoying little paths and wandering around. Really needed the break from all the city and this was the perfect refuge.

Huge||January 30, 2017
DanielJSlick||40||There was nothing spectacular about this public park, other than the size and the fact that's its bounded by palaces and monuments; relative to London, that's not an outstanding fact. Many of the pathways were partially submerged in water, making travel difficult. However, the tranquility of the park, and the opportunity to disconnect yourself from many of your fellow parkgoers and indulge in activities of your choosing, makes this an excellent place to come for exercise or relaxation.||January 30, 2017
Mkaraoli||50||We visited on both days of our London staying.. once during the early evening (around 7) and once in the afternoon.Both times were just perfect! There is a market with a lot of handmade stuff. There is a wine bar in the middle of the market and a nice little tea house and with amazing cakes and cupcakes! Lots of shopping opportunities! Well known brand stores are located near the market area (channel, Burberry , Dior, Michael Kors etc).There is also an Apple store there! Will recommend to visit it early in the afternoon to see it on its full glory! ||January 30, 2017
Jack W||50||We visited this great park 3 days consecutively in late January and were never disappointed with the nonhuman animals. Shout out to the coots in the medium sized pond and all the swans doing their thing. Squirrels are always fun but these guys really excel in their field - you don't know lively 'til you encounter one !Do you like herons? Head on down to The Arch by Henry Moore! We spent a happy moment with him & his plumage. Neat-o!The main attraction (no surprises here!) is the canine community. Gee, what folks! Get a Load of that Lab! Holler at a Husky! Wink at this Weimaraner! There's no end to the delightful dogs here at Hyde Park. Real frivolous fun.||January 30, 2017
tsn02||40||Such a lovely place!!! Lots to look at or just to enjoy a leisurely stroll.never realised how big it was--we spent hours there!!! Xx||January 30, 2017
Ankurs99||50||Very well maintained at such a central location well connected and vast open area with an addition of a lake||January 30, 2017
Jenny J||50||Tons of lovely green space. Bird watching was especially fun. Happy that we stayed at a hotel right on the outskirts of Hyde Park. ||January 30, 2017
Ingvar I||50||It was cold, a little windy and it was getting darker. But it was an excellent walk. I had never actually been around Hyde Park before. It is beautiful and huge. It is massive. There isn't really a good explanation to explain just how massively huge it is. But it is so worth walking around. The lake is big with some fascinating fowl's, and Kingston parakeets everywhere wanting to sit on you in the hopes that you have some seeds to give them. There were plenty of places to go cycling and lots of runners going around, which just made me want to get my running kit on and run around as well. Pretty sure that it would take the whole day to see everything even then.||January 30, 2017
TreyF4better||50||After breakfast, I went for a promenade along the paths of Hyde Park! Families, couples, runners, dogs played by with their owners and kids played and laughed freely in the cool midday air.I walked the whole park, 4k according to my pedometer on my phone. I saw lots of history and monuments. Great for walking off all that food!||January 29, 2017
TheExploringShoes||50||Love Hyde Park, wonderful for walking the dogs, cycling, walking, tree climbing, nature, sun bathing, jogging, picnicking... just wonderful to visit. The array of birdlife is at the hear of the park, you can even ride horses here too! It really is the park of parks, oh did i mention there is a boating lake? Yeah even the chance to swim for the real adventurer I guess! So on top of all this you may even spot a wild parrot in the tree tops while your sipping tea in the cafe here - what more can I say, the best things in life are free and this is one of them :D||January 29, 2017
Charlotte T||40||Park is really big and in the dark is difficult to navigate but everyone is friendly and try to help you. During the day park is a good place for children to run around||January 29, 2017
Dya021||50||A huge and amazing park!! I rested there with my family after a long walk, with a very good coffee and we admired the pigeons! Very lovely!||January 29, 2017
pbjprops||50||Beautiful, large, and lively park. Great place for exercise and long walks. Feed the ducks and other birds in the large lake. Cafes are available to dine or enjoy beverages. Perfect for families. Monuments to see along the way such as the monument to Diana.||January 29, 2017
LaLa R||50||Hyde Park is located in the Knightsbridge area. It's vast and beautiful. Not too noisy and I did notice one outdoor restaurant full of patrons. There are tiny waterfalls around the park and quiet spaces to just relax and take in nature and the scenery.||January 28, 2017
louisewilltravel||50||Take time out from the city in this great green space. From cycling, running, walking and even horse riding this is a jewel in central London. There is also a lovely cafe at the Park Lane side and smaller huts throughout the park for refreshments. What's not to love?!||January 28, 2017
Aileen B||40||We like staying in the Bayswater section of London and one of the reason is being able to strool through the park.. Even in winter, it's such a quiet , green and oais in the middle of a very large city.||January 28, 2017
SarahS6813||50||Worth a trip for winter wonderland. Free entry, all kinds of attractions with great attention to detail. ||January 28, 2017
garyk468||50||After a busy day of sightseeing the day before we decided to slow the pace and walk around Hyde Park. Grab a coffee and go. There's monuments, lakes and plenty of wildlife to see. There's also a couple of tourists attractions around the park.||January 27, 2017
TripTipr||40||A great place to go and relax, enjoy the green space, birds, fresh air...especially right after waiting in the crowds to watch the change of guard at the Palace - a short walk away.||January 26, 2017
vangelist2013||50||Since I was student I loved to walk in the park, especially to the area close to Bayswater road. However, there is no place in the park which can't be recommended. I suggest you to walk it from the Hyde Park Corner entrance, cross the Serpentine lake, take a coffee or beer at Lido, walk to Diana's memorial and exit to Notting Hill gate.Fabulous day!||January 26, 2017
Olesya L||50||Whatever you do in London, I think that if you haven't visited Hyde Park, you should be ashamed of saying you've been in the UK... It has beautiful lakes, picturesque views, places to relax and meditate, play sports, take pictures... Even if you are just passing it by on your way to the Royal Albert's Hall, it's worth it...Maybe you will be even lucky enough to feed some of the local squirrels, like we were :)||January 26, 2017
aleksandari318||50||i love this place it is really quiet and nice to sit and have a special moment with your friends or family . ||January 26, 2017
christinag795||50||This is the parks for all parks and truly makes you realize what building a park to stand the test of time should look like. This brilliant space has tons of paths which somehow make the massive space appear to have some level of intimacy. But don't let life keep you in a box because luckily you can walk the entire grounds to include off the paved walking paths.This park also offers a hidden museums right in the center of the park which is exhibiting a Zaha Hadid exhibit showcasing all of her artwork which was stunning! My husbands an architect so this was a very pleasant surprise!Really a gem that's worth stopping and seeing.-Cheers||January 26, 2017
HCarmen||50||Went for a long stroll on Sunday afternoon with a close friend. Picked up a hot chocolate and it was so lovely to see lots of different people enjoying themselves in the winter sun. The boats were attempting to cross the half frozen serpentine and there is plenty to do in every season. ||January 26, 2017
MannyChamp||50||Beautiful park with lost of animals and birds. We saw one swan walking on bridge and wanted to put him back in water since he seem to be trying to find way to water but everyone was scared to take him because we did not want to hurt him. Pretty place||January 25, 2017
95nikop||50||In winter there is so much to see and do. The park in winter contains the big Christmas markets - "Winter Wonderland." This is a very large amusement park that also sells some food and has small market stalls. It was a free event and worth coming to visit over Christmas. In addition to Winter Wonderland the park is very large and also houses Kensington Gardens and Palace, which is worth visiting.||January 25, 2017
BeeteeEm||50||Hyde park has everything from boating on the Serpentine to wold walks to ornate Kensington Gardens. There are tennis courts, several restaurants, an art gallery, famous statues, a lido and Diana's Fountain. It is great for dog walking, cycling and running about. Hyde Park covers a huge area of West London. in the summer there are rock concerts and winter - Christmas fairs.||January 24, 2017
268tr||40||London has quite a few parks and green spaces. Surely, Hyde Park is the most famous. It's not as vast or versatile as Central Park in NYC, for instance. But it's worth a visit to get away from bustling London for a bit. Trees, lawns, lakes, geese, roses ... Personally, I like to make it my jogging ground when I'm in London, as do many other people. Just watch the cyclists. ;-)||January 24, 2017
Windy0309||50||Beautiful place to visit, lots to do or lovely for just a walk through. You forgot you are surrounded by the busy central London. ||January 24, 2017
sendlyfern@goog... f||40||Hyde park is a good park and there are lots of people coming to see the princess Diana history and also there is big lake with lots of duck and different kinds of birds and I enjoyed to feed them breads||January 24, 2017
Stacy_247||40||A beautiful place to walk around in London. There are lots of benches and there is a pretty big pond full of ducks. One interesting point is that some of the chairs, with the green and white stripes, are not free to sit in. How crazy! But they do look nice in a picture. There is also an adorable restaurant near the pond called Serpentine, which I would recommend. The setting is perfect. ||January 24, 2017
JI52||50||You could walk and walk here and still not cover every aspect of this wonderful park. And you can access it from various regal sounding names. ||January 24, 2017
saminm585||50||Certainly one of the best places for walking in London. Beautiful and calm. It will be your choice for a sunny day here but finish your walk before sunset :D it is a bit uncomfortable in dark nights. The best place to have picnic. Enjoy the beautiful Hyde Park||January 24, 2017
mariagallagher00||40||This park is so large that if you dissect it, it will take you to 4 different cities. Bayswater is such a cute area! It's also just 15 minutes away from everything. Very accessible!||January 23, 2017
LaChance01||40||The park is beautiful. Lots of people running and lots of people for a leisurely walk. I was a bit apprehensive since so many people have their dogs off leash but they all seem to be very well behaved. ||January 23, 2017
badbaruch57||40||took a walk with the whole family in the park . its vast and beautiful but its so cold in the winter . we enjoyed strolling the park .||January 23, 2017
Fay C||50||Fantastic park so vast and beautiful , many coffee shops and resturant all provide good food and excellent service.I often go there with friend for picnic.||January 23, 2017
JoaoCardosoSousa||50||I beautifull place to go for a walk or a run. A pet friendly park. If you like squirls, bring some hazelnuts and watch them climb you!!||January 23, 2017
jess B||50||Lovely and peaceful. Lots to do, if you chose to...or you can just sit and chill. Coffee shop so you aren't stuck. Will come back here in the summer definitely ||January 22, 2017
hockeyaw19||50||This park does not have a nasty side. It is really nice through and through. You can walk the entire length of the park and get in a really nice work out. Went here on an overcast day in January and there were many people out walking as well as dogs running (leash free) playing. It is a great park and shouldn't be missed, especially in the spring/summer.||January 22, 2017
es-travler||50||One of the best places in London to spend a Sunday. Lots of space, lots of possible activities and sights.||January 22, 2017
72chuckb||40||The most famous park in London. It's very beautiful and scenic, make sure see princess Diana's fountain. The walkways are wide and easy to navigate but wear comfortable sneakers as it's very large||January 22, 2017
311antonl||40||Really nice and bid park that basically has everything you need from a park. Nice views, nice flowers, some cafes. Perfect for a lazy afternoon stroll.||January 22, 2017
Lucia C||50||You can bring your own lunch or go to the many restaurants, even in the winter there are lots of things to do. Kensington palace is wonderful and there is hours of fun, just in walking. If you do feed the birds such as swans, use seed or brown bread. No white bread, no crisps, no mouldy food.||January 22, 2017
Jwhite910||50||Home of my all time favorite movie "101 Dalmatians"- I love this park. We ended up visiting during Winter Wonderland, which was amazing. So much to do and enjoy.. Ice skating, Ice Sculptures, Games, Food, Activities. Worth visiting, even more during Winter Wonderland.||January 22, 2017
CMB7694||50||Hyde is likely one of the best natural parks in the World...I spent the Winter Holiday in Paddington, which is just North of Hyde; so I had the opportunity to stroll through the Park literally everyday. During the day, there are many well laid paths that will take you to Kensington Palace, Marble Arch, and in the Winter; the Winter Wonderland (which is a must visit for Christmas).During the Summer, there are paddle boats on the water and the current rates ranged between $12-$20/boat (depending on exchange).On many nights I walked through the Park, as-well, and never felt unsafe. ||January 22, 2017
Kriszty777||50||We were very impressed with the Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park ! Every sight and sound and smell of Christmas was experienced . It was free admission and he atmosphere was just amazing . From roasted chestnuts to a rotating carousel that was a bar, to theme park looking coasters - each and every one of us had a great time ||January 21, 2017
talfrynf||50||Hyde Park is absolutely stunning; well maintained and with plenty for everyone to do. From boats on the serpentine to the Diana memorial fountain and children's play park. The cafes and food stands are very overpriced - but if you pack yourself a picnic you should be able to avoid them on the whole. I would recommend finding the Peter Pan statue and listening to his message on your phone. The Italian gardens in Kensington gardens are lovely to sit in on a sunny day. ||January 21, 2017
Sherpa480914||50||Went for a stroll in this historic park and was pleasantly surprised with beautiful swans in the lake, the Princess Diana of Wales memorial, & other monumental fountains. If in noting hill- a definite visit.||January 20, 2017
Stef0197||50||I came here whilst the Winter Wonderland was on and it was incredible!! I also hired a Santander bike near by and rode through the park which I would definitely recommend. I had a great afternoon and night here.||January 20, 2017
376omari||40||Hyde park is a large green space in the centre of london. It has bayswater and notting hill to one side and south kensington and knightsbridge on the other.Lots of paths to walk around, a large lake, the serpentine with pedalos, the diana memorial fountain, playgrounds, art galleries and to one side kensington palace with its lovely gardens! It has so much there.Great place to wander around, picnic, keep energetic kids busy etc!RegardsOmar||January 20, 2017
Bryan A||50||Enjoyed the stroll around the park and found the famous Hyde park corner. This was a great place to enjoy some of the London history and get out of the busy city. ||January 20, 2017
AnneNorthTravels||50||On Christmas Day when everything was closed my son and I rented bikes and toured Hyde park. What a wonderful way to spend the day in the fresh crisp air of a London winter (don't laugh!). It's pushed the soreness right out of our feet (and into our bums).Tip: Know who lives where before you go so it's easier to appreciate all the grand houses.Tip: Bring a long cable type bike lock with you so you can leave the bikes secured while you get some tea etc. No helmets provide.||January 20, 2017
overtherainbow16||50||Great park for long walks with nice playground to keep kids busy. We can spend there whole day with packed lunch and warm coffee. ||January 19, 2017
hennakyawaye||50||hype park is good for a day out with friends or family. it's pretty big park and there are public toilets and cafe too.||January 19, 2017
AfnanMandurah||40||fantastic, calm, relax, quiet place and get away from the movement of people.. very large for walking and hiking.. suitable for families.. the characteristic of the lake with ducks and geese||January 18, 2017
Edgar S||50||All the travelers that comes to London have to go to the Hyde Park, it's The Park of London, lots to see and loads places to run or just to have a coffee with the friends||January 18, 2017
melisos||50||i always hyde park must see in london it was so relaxing even it was cold december day but people were still there and chilling out it was good walk they kept it so clean||January 17, 2017
Anki V||40||The last day we had a nice stroll in sunny weather in Hyde park. We walked to Portobello riad market- it was nice||January 17, 2017
wesjoan||50||We had a chance to watch some of the debates that was taking place the day before leaving on British Airlines to head back for home.....||January 17, 2017
TianC62||50||This place is a lovely place to visit. A must for people to have a picnic or even a nice day out. I love to walk when i am here and it is connected to kensington. ||January 17, 2017
kmby||50||Definitely worth loosing yourself here for a couple of hours. Plenty of wild life to see and cafe is great for a stop off||January 17, 2017
Rach1973||50||A huge winter wonderland with loads of market stalls and places to eat as well as loads of rides for all ages! It was busy but seemed to be well organised well worth a visit ||January 17, 2017
FaitheTraveller||50||If nothing else, Hyde Park is one of the nicest places to be in London. On a beautiful sunny day (given 4 - 5 in the year) this is really a lovely park to spend the day, read, play some sport, have a picnic, rollerblade, people watch or just about anything. From 25 years ago to today, it's still my favourite and most valued part of London.||January 17, 2017
skaren4||40||loved hyde park, enjoyed feeding the squirrels and walking around the park but best of all visiting Winter Wonderland.||January 17, 2017
hollyp710||50||I live 1 mile from Hyde Park and cycle through everyday. There is something for everyone in the huge park - families, friends, joggers, sports players... everyone. It's an absolute must when visiting or living in London!Keep off the cycle paths if you are walking though - you will get run over by commuters!||January 17, 2017
Kelly S||40||A massive park with lots of things to do with the kids and family, great for couples or friends. Always events on in the summer and nice for a stroll in the spring. Big lake and lovely paths to walk around. ||January 17, 2017
Maria T||50||This park is huge and has everything you need. It is good for just taking a walk to clear your head, so go for a run, walk your dog, taking your kids out to play, kick a ball around. You can rent a rowing boat or a paddle boat and enjoy some time on the water. When the weather is good, the place is really crowded, but since it's a huge park, you can always find some place to relax and hang out. If you don't have a great sense of direction (like me) make sure you know where you're going, or you might get lost (like me) haha.||January 17, 2017
Serena B||50||Hyde park is simply wonderful and if you have time its a great place to wander around regardless of what time of year you visit!Always clean and well looked after.Great for kids and families!||January 17, 2017
931RobS||40||Hyde Park is big enough to enable you to find a quiet spot away from anyone else for a bit of peace and quiet when needed. It's also big enough to get a good walk/cycle/or run. There's plenty of history and local interest - well signposted. You can get refreshments. You can even be entertained by the squirrels!||January 16, 2017
Lily B||40||This park is full of wildlife, trees and is just completely green. There is more than enough space, and no where in this park was crowded, great little rest stop on your adventures. ||January 16, 2017
A1931HGjohnd||50||Mid January perhaps isn't the best time to be wandering through parkland, but it didn't dampen our experience at all. Very few people about allowed us to enjoy the space as we walked past the Serpentine with its abundant bird life. The range of birds perching on piles across the water was hilarious. Seeing Kensington Palace through the wonderfully poignant Diana Memorial was a special experience.||January 16, 2017
OMurphyUK||50||I grew up in London and have been living abroad for a couple of years but every time I go back I have to take a stroll around Hyde Park. I usually walk from one side over to Buckingham Palace. It's peaceful and gives you a break from the busy, urban side of the city.||January 16, 2017
pmdnair||50||If you are visiting London keep a day for Hyde park including visit to Kensington Palace. Walking around the park is awesome and great place to relax, take lots of pictures..||January 16, 2017
ANDREW W||40||London is well served by parks. This one is large and has cafes and toilets, boats to hire, and gives access to the Albert memorial and the Royal Albert Hall.||January 16, 2017
AOmeiri||40||The park is nice and allow several activities but get really crowded during the summer which part of the fun. Make sure to have some coins if you want to you the sun bathing chairs and should try to take a paddle boat around the lake ||January 15, 2017
lizbelk||50||My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed walking throughout the park. it was so pretty, and clean. We enjoyed watching the families just enjoying the natural beauty of this park. I imagined that Princess Diana had to have strolled through the park with her young children. Kensington Palace is very close and Although very nice we all know now that the big palace was very lonely. I hope she often enjoyed this awesome park that had to have been hers to use whenever she chose.||January 15, 2017
Joanne S||50||A nice tranquil walk here around the serpentine and the princess Diana fountain. The London parks are very nice and tranquil.||January 15, 2017
PrettoMauricio||50||This park is just unbelievable, the huge park it's located on the heart of London, and deservers a good walk to see how the London people enjoy this jewel on their city.People running, walking, cycling or just giving bread to the ducks on the lakes.Walk inside the park, go take a look at the Palace and many statues and enjoy this great free activity in the middle of London.||January 15, 2017
MRFRANK86||50||A short couples visit to the Park, walk through and enjoy a ice cream in the sun. Highly recommended stop to see. ||January 15, 2017
lornaf196||50||Walked around the lake on a Saturday morning. Busy but not crowded. Lots of activities going on, so good for people watching. Even although it was mid winter, it was a pleasant, flat, easy walk.||January 15, 2017
mayya13||50||Beautiful! The greenery, the calm, the lake with the beautiful swans and ducks, a very nice outing in London ||January 15, 2017
Go_Travel_Fun_12||50||Excellent quiet walks in a beautiful park in the middle of the metropolis. When visiting London I often recharge my batteries and take a walk whether winter or summer in this lovely park, It is never that busy. Walk or sitting down or a combination, some people watching and wildlife watching, I have actually seen a fox in the park one early evening and walked within ten feet of me after stopping and looking at me for a while. There are also some parakeets living in the trees high up a light green colour that seem to have stayed there. Sometime if you are lucky you may spot a celebrity out jogging or walking, I have done in the past, there's always a chance. But just to reinvigorate the mind and body I can thoroughly recommend a stroll. This time I even saw my first snow drops of the year. Spring is around the corner.||January 15, 2017
hanaalh||50||It is nice to visit this park , it is remind me of my childhood when I was very young my parents used to walk me there , it is pleasant walk ||January 14, 2017
Saskia201515||50||My 14 year old and I love Hyde Park..it's huge so never crowded and there is a warm and friendly disposition amongst walkers and even the dogs. The lake is beautiful to photograph as are the trees in all seasons. It's transformed at Christmas...skating a bit pricy but then I guess the costs of setting up Winter Wonderland are too. Magical area so close to the beginning of Oxford Street||January 14, 2017
sowpow||30||It's a nice park and online people said there were really pretty holiday lights in Hyde Park but all we saw was the Winter Wonderland carnival and we didn't see any holiday lights||January 14, 2017
mshelenwoo||50||There is a amusement park set up to attract teenagers for excitements for roller coasters and spinning games. Can spend a whole day with kids if it's a sunny and warm day.It was raining cats and dogs when I was there. There are hot foods anywhere e.g. Hot Dogs and pies and dessert. Token must be purchased before you can queue for the games. Good for kids. Just for Christmas. Jan 3 will be closed.||January 14, 2017
48ashc||40||Went to Hyde park for winter wonderland. Was really good apart from the fact it had been raining and the floor coverings were all pushing water up every time you stood on one. So apart from wet feet it was really good||January 14, 2017
Neese12||50||We think an annual trip to Winter Wonderland is a must to soak up the atomosphere. There really is no need to spend any money at all - and to be honest the attractions are just too expensive really to even consider (except for the rpovsio below) and the food concessions are mostly a bit of a must miss. Our TopTips: go on as weekday. If you have to go at the weekend pre-purchase a ticket for the cheapest attraction to beat the queues - which are so long near Christmas in the evenings that you might not even get in||January 13, 2017
Amy K||50||Our visit here was everything we expected it to be - gorgeous gardens, huge old trees, lovely walks, a fantastic playground. An unmissable experience when visiting London - you really could spend whole days here, especially if you bring a picnic and a good book!||January 13, 2017
Carolyn Q||40||Walked through here on our way out of high tea at the Orangery at Kensington Palace. Definitely worth the visit if you're in the area.||January 13, 2017
retiredtravelagent||50||I always stay on or near the park twice a year, and Hyde Park is my release. Sometimes it's quicker to walk across than to take a taxi. Due to the crazy London road system. Park is regularly stifled by the london traffic "geniuses" so that traffic gets stuck. But its far enough away from the trails as to not bother me.||January 13, 2017
Emily_Chester||40||Hyde Park is great for various things - walking through when wandering around London; going for a jog; walking the dog; a leg stretch after lots of driving around/spending a lot of time on the tube; giving the children time to play games or go on the playground. Also great for a little time out from London (despite being in the middle of it!).||January 13, 2017
Karen S||50||Great day out or night if your visiting Hyde park at Xmas time. We spent all day there and had an amazing time. Take lots of money as there is plenty to spend it on. Go early if you can as it does get busy mid afternoon. Dress warmly you will stay longer than you think.||January 13, 2017
Penny412014||50||Fab place just to go with a blanket and a book by yourself or chill out, or with a bunch of friends for a picnic. Loads of natural things for the kids to do with the ponds etc. Thoroughly worth a visit||January 13, 2017
jonpita||50||Amazing place with amazing nature around. You can chill easily when you walk by and see the animals there||January 13, 2017
Robbie B||40||Although a little barren inthe winter still a great unwind from the city and meet the locals and their four legged friends.||January 12, 2017
whispero||50||What a beautiful park, lovely for nice long walks, beautiful views all around, there is parking everywhere around this park. We visit when winter wonderland is on as well and it's a amazing day out.Definitely recommend this park.||January 12, 2017
Geoff L||50||Hyde Park was great for an afternoon walk. Opposite the road from our hotel. The Park was clean and tidy||January 12, 2017
MaureenRiley44||50||Even though I was in London during the winter, I enjoyed my walks in Hyde Park immensely. It's so beautiful and there are many things to see. It's the prefect place to exhale and spend time with nature while in the city.||January 12, 2017
instructorjason||50||We visited Hyde park a few times as we stayed very close in South Kensington. Unfortunately we did not have enough time to spend an extended amount of time at the park. We visited the Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park corner twice, and toured around the park in a bus tour. It was very nice.||January 12, 2017
AliceNeow||50||The park has always been my favourite. A walking distance from Bayswater tube station. A lovely place for a walk, jog or even taking dogs for a walk. It links to places linked to the late Princess Diana, lakes and ponds with Winter Wonderland nearby. If you are keen to walk, from Hyde Park, using the Citymapper app, you can walk all the way to Oxford Street, Harrods, Buckingham Palace, etc. The park is well-maintained and safe. ||January 12, 2017
Grillt||30||WHY did they allow that enormous amusement fair adjacent to Park Lane?? Ok its popular but it really spoils this end of the park ||January 12, 2017
NikonCoupleSoFlo||40||Hyde Park was really large and at the end of it is Kensington Palace. The Pond is a sight to behold with many aquatic birds - Swans, Ducks, Pigeons and the like! Squirrels are huge compared to the ones in the states. There is a famous walkway/path dedicated to the late Princess Diana. Along the park you can also see Prince Albert's Shrine across from that the Royal Albert Music Hall.||January 11, 2017

Sally B||50||I go to Hyde park every time I come to London. A welcome green respite from the hustle and incessant rush of the world around it. ||January 10, 2017
ArghyaKolkata||40||Probably the best park in London. It's GIGANTIC. Seriously, think about the fact it's in CENTRAL London for a second, then consider the size of that thing and you get a pretty good picture as of why this place is amazing. Especially in the sun. If you go to the Serpentine Lake, you can have beers, ice creams, hot dogs, burgers and even rent a pedalo or roaming boat. Pretty cool activities to do in the summer time. Careful not to get lost.||January 10, 2017
Maradenver||50||I used to spend days at a time here when I lived in London. it a great place to go get away from the chaos of the city for a bit. find a quiet corner or listen to the people at speakers corner, or walk through on your way to another part of London instead of taking the tube. ||January 10, 2017
AnujaMangle||30||The park is in London and one of the largest in the city. You should visit to relax in the evening or in the morning for a walk. Kids will enjoy a lot here ||January 10, 2017
biner10||50||Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park can seem just like an ordinary busy London park/green space during the day, busy, loud, full of life and walkers and tourists. For something completely different, walk a circuit of the park at dawn or just as the sun is coming up and you will find a completely magical place that hardly seems to be London. Watch mist rising off the ground and the lakes, early morning swimmers in the serpentine, early guards on horses, birds and wildlife galore and a wonderful sense of calm. There are fine items of architecture and art dotted around the park, find them at this time of the day and they feel special, completely different to normal.||January 9, 2017
Dianne S||50||My walk around Hyde Park took me to another dimension of beautiful London. Having a wander around made me think how fantastic it is, the way the City has so much to offer the people of London, (tourists) my thing is if you can't find it in London you can't find it anywhere. I found solitude and peace in the park.||January 9, 2017
Lynne M||50||Whilst wandering through Hyde Park you wouldn't know that you were only minutes away from the busy London traffic. There are many shaded paths to follow, whether a pedestrian, cyclist or horse rider, acres of ground to kick a ball, picnic and laze around. Ideal spot to take children. However, care would have to be taken along the waters edge were you can sit and watch the white swans and paddle boats for hours. Deck chairs are set out on the grass anyone to use, great for tourists like us and saves lugging chairs into the Park. Loved Speaker's corner, interesting to watch and listen to very motivated speakers up on their soap boxes. ||January 9, 2017
jamie e||40||Has some lovely scenic views and is next to regents park with famous landmarks.Busy vibrant park in the capital.||January 9, 2017
ivanbJ2479UL||50||Central par in New York is something else, but hyde park also has it's pluses! Great for sunny day walks and every other outdoor activity like cycling etc.If you have time spend few hours there!||January 8, 2017
stuarth1888||50||Difficult to know how to review a park but if you compare to other parks it's got to be a five star. Great location, surrounded by amazing buildings, next to Buckingham palace & lots of other attractions & all within walking distance. A lovely place to stroll, jog, picnic or whatever & away from the hussle & bussle that sits just outside of the park. The kids love it with little play areas to occupy them & a few ice cream & coffee bars scattered around too. Up there with Central Park in New York & the parks sited in mid-Sydney. Worth a visit & stroll through. If winter wonderland is on then even better, great event & food amazing! ||January 8, 2017
jhorner5||50||Been here so many times, depending on the time of year, there is music gigs, the winter wonderland. A pedalo or boat on the serpentine is a fun way to spend an hour or 2. Decent cafe and coffee shop. Easy to get to from Hyde park corner tube station. The princess Diana memorial is worth a walk to at the far end of the park. Great place to watch the world go by.||January 8, 2017
leesvillelake||50||Walked here from near Green Park Tube and thoroughly enjoyed it. We love Hyde Park in summer, but we had never been here at night or in winter. Crowds were huge, but the long line to enter moved quickly. Security was everywhere, and bags were checked upon entry. Site was secure from vehicular intrusions. The smells of Christmas were everywhere, and a typical European Christmas market was set up near the entrance. No one seemed bothered by the cold or drizzle. The rides appeared to be German, and we were amused to see an "Alaska" attraction that was just a bit too stereotypical. This was another reason to love London at Christmas.||January 8, 2017
Dean F||40||Good place to see some of the people of London and how they enjoy their days in the park. Good place to feed the birds, swans and walk over to Harrods to see where the rich shop.||January 8, 2017
caspertabboo||50||We popped here whilst visiting London and it's such a beautiful place to see peaceful and a lovely walk around seeing the views and wildlife ||January 8, 2017
Sarawak2016fan||50||One of my favourites running route whenever I visit London. Scenic views of the lakes and various other landmarks make this a great place to run.||January 8, 2017
ladymack44||50||Had a lovely 2 days there bit expensive, but what do you expect being in London, nice xmas market lots of rides if you like going on them, there is the Bavarian village with several bars and live bands, well worth a visit, security is great as you go in all bags searched ||January 7, 2017
omi_cy||40||Enjoy a visit to this park and combine it with a visit to winter wonderland which is near. Really impressing.||January 7, 2017
MacarenaM810||30||Lovely park for a walk or a picnic. Your can see squirrels, swans, ducks and many other animals running free around the park. But to be honest, I felt unsafe the first time I walked around the lake on my own. I am a young woman, and the benches were packed with large groups of men (all from the same religion), that stared at me continuously, and stopped talking when I passed by. I was wearing normal, respectful clothes. They said nothing to me, but made me feel really unconfortable.||January 7, 2017
edwin577||50||An amazing place. No litter, wonderful wild life, beautiful lake, and clean!! The Diana memorial is a must see. It is architecturally wonderful.||January 7, 2017
Royalty_Rania||50||Great Park Always very well looked off , lots of bins around so that you can put your rubbish away A very big park so try your best not to get lost ||January 7, 2017
summerfun81||40||Great early morning walk on New Years Day. Lots of people running and lots of swans and geese to watch. Very relaxing||January 6, 2017
Grumpy_Art||50||Had a nice afternoon stroll. There weren't a lot of people at the side where I was. Nice place for families to hangout and just sit on the benches or on the grass for a picnic.||January 6, 2017
schererd||50||Loved it! Absolutely worth a visit, especially when the crowds of tourists start to get to you and you need some time to get away and just breathe for a little while.||January 6, 2017
Shasha S||50||Fantastic park for children, due to memorial gardens with sand and water play and large pirate ship. Also good for adults, especially as you can swim in the lake!||January 6, 2017
Tatyana D||50||Park for all tastes - jogging, strolling, walking, wathcing, sitting, lounging, relaxing with friends, family, alone - the park is your oyster. Princes Diana's memorial, The Children's playground, Speaker's corner, the lake with the swans, the rose gardens, the horses paths - every time we go there, there is someting to see and children love running around. But the best thing about it is that despite being in the heart of London it is NOT crowded as it is so big, there is enough space for everyone visiting.||January 6, 2017
Kitkat5155||50||We took Boris bikes and cycled round the outside of the park. The park is large and there are galleries and things to do within. In the summer months you can enjoy a boat ride on the serpentine.||January 6, 2017
Rachel3413||50||Me and my partner went to hyde park specifically to go on the boating on the Serpentine lake. It was a fantastic day and was a wonderful experience feeding the ducks while on the boat. We opted for a rowing boat as opposed to a pedalo, which was a lot less tiring but harder to steer. We hired the boat for an hour, which was just enough time to go around the whole lake and back. There were mostly couples on the boats and not many children. I assume this is because it's slightly dangerous as they could fall in, but staff do provide life jackets and helmets if you want them. We fed the ducks which caused a swarm of swans and ducks to surround the boat which was lovely! The view was amazing and it was fun trying not to crash into the other boats and both apologising in a very British way when we did.The park itself was very beautiful and always so well kept. Very peaceful way to spend your afternoon. I would advise you plan toilet breaks well, especially if you have young children! We had to walk a long time before we found the nearest toilet and you have to pay to use them.||January 6, 2017
Sophia128||50||Nice especially it's Christmas season. A must especially of the attraction winter wonderland . It's just cold at night time . ||January 6, 2017
rya03l||40||We stayed in South Kensington and it was a lovely walk through the park to Bayswater. There are bike hire facility at the entrance if you prefer. The park is well kept.||January 5, 2017
Naude_Marelize||40||Wish we had beautiful parks like this back home. Peaceful and quaint. Sunday stroll! Doggies back home will love it.||January 5, 2017
vikki917||50||Beautiful walk lots of different birds there was a colony of green Cockatoos, they were so tame they eat out of your hands, We all love walking in hide park so many wonderful sights to see||January 5, 2017
FlyingTheCoop||50||Hyde Park is one of the first places I visit when in London. The 350 acres of park is a popular meeting place and there is plenty of space to share. The walking paths are well maintained, there are many sporting parks and it even boasts a wonderful horse-riding track smack in the middle of London. Every time I stroll through the park, I can't help but drift to thoughts of King Henry VIII riding through in pursuit of deer. This was his private hunting forest in the mid-1500's.||January 5, 2017
PraSat02||40||Great Xmas trip to winter wonderland in Hyde Park. Free entry is a bonus with lots to do for all ages. There is a circus show and ice animal Kingdom but these have to be paid for.Will return next year!||January 5, 2017
Malinka E||50||You can walk there for hours. Nice scenery, nice people. Natural environments - flowers, birds, a lot of trees, fountains, lakes and rivers. If tired, sit on numerous benches or on the grass. Read a book, have lunch, ideal for jogging. I really love this place.||January 5, 2017
May-Lis H||50||I never get tired of this beautiful park. Always enjoying the fountains, lazing with a cup of tea in one of the cafès, or strolling along, looking at the statues - especially Peter Pan and Ibis, which never cease to make my heart jump. And Diana Memorial Fountain! So beautiful! Any time of year, Hyde Park will always charm you.||January 5, 2017
davebw0lves||40||Took a stroll round Hyde Park on New Years Eve. Started by Kensington Palace which was picturesque, fairly expensive to go in so gave it a miss. Wanted to follow the Diana Memorial Walk, series of plaques on ground but found it hard to find. Once on it was OK.Nice and quiet for a city centre until we got the the area occupied by Winter Wonderland.||January 5, 2017
SophieLMo||50||Even In winter Hyde park is stunning being home to the winter wonderland attraction but all year round it's a beautiful place and a lovely walk as a couple or family ||January 5, 2017
graham f||50||What a pleasant experience to walk through Hyde Park on a crisp winters morning, everything is just so relaxing. Even had time to do a bit of bird watching.||January 5, 2017
Carmina R||50||Great place for some serious walking. I enjoyed watching and feeding the birds there. Lots of things to see there.||January 4, 2017
Kravma||50||really nice place to relax and chill out if you fancy a bit of chill out time away from the busier parts of London||January 4, 2017
forshara||50||No matter what time of year, Hyde Park is a lovely place to stroll to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Sunday mornings are entertaining at "Speaker's Corner" which happens year round. You can listen to a variety of people who want to share their opinion. Around Christmas, there is Winter Wonderland to celebrate the Christmas season. There is something for every season in this beautiful park. If you are in London, you can't miss it!||January 4, 2017
Fidzje||50||looking for a relaxing walk, well hype's Park will do the job.Nice big park in the heart of London, great to visit with kids or as a couple!||January 4, 2017
jo h||50||A beautiful park, constantly new things to do! My best suggestion would be to buy a ticket for live music in the summer, great venue! The lakes are fun, pedalos and row boats! Walking or cycling around is a lovely thing to do! Cafes are good but often busy - very close to many great restaurants, bars and shops!||January 4, 2017
Susan E||50||Hyde Park was absolutely amazing especially winter wonderland we walked for miles stopping in the barvarian village for eats and mulled wine ||January 4, 2017
trinewbie23||50||We went here for Princess Di's memorial. Very well done.Was pleasantly surprised that we just loved the Park as well- huge green space. Bicycles everywhere. Water nearby where you can rent (or let) paddle boats. ||January 4, 2017
holidayfun52||50||Not every country has put so much space aside for parks. This is in the capital. Probably reminiscent of a time when the whole place was green with a few villages here and there. A safe space to let the children run around with no fear of getting run over or savaged by dogs in the center of town.Well, when I last lived in London and visited the place the cyclists were not quite as aggressive as now. They kind of expect you to move. There was me saying you would not be that safe in the concrete parks of China and a cyclist is snarling at me for standing still between them and a toddler. To the (royal?) park attendants. The cyclists should be informed it is a privilege to cycle in the park, not a right. Perhaps closure of the cycle lane and let them taste the road a bit so they remember not to bully pedestrians.Otherwise as amazing as I remembered it, and a whole lot greener and beautiful.||January 4, 2017
Stephen T||50||Great large park in London. Very easily accessed by Public transport. Hire one of the bikes and spend a few hours cycling and enjoying the day||January 4, 2017
crowellc||50||It's a great place to walk through when visiting the area. Even during the winder it was a nice experience.||January 4, 2017
mariedesjardins||40||Walked through briefly on the way to see the changing of the guard at Buckingham palace in September 2013. Large grassy area with a lake to enjoy. Lots of beach chair style seating on the lawn. Wooden with cloth to flop into. Looked nice for relaxing on a sunny day. Not many yet in the morning. Nice place for a picnic, sit and enjoy the peace, or lots of open space to let the kids run around.||January 3, 2017
arbeitsuchen8415||50||I just feel surprised to find such a refreshing place in central London. This is the London version of Central Park, which is more like a nature conservation area than a park, where you can see all sorts of natural landscapes and wildlife. I just enjoy taking a walk by the Serpentine in the morning in Hyde Park. In winter, this park is just a winter wonderland, with all the frosty grassland and mist. And the Round Pound even reminds me of the Arctic!||January 3, 2017
mimip618||40||Went to the park to see the winter wonderland The park is huge and the venue of winters wonderland is amazing you can take ride with lots of extreme ride, also for kids Also have many food and bazaar of Xmas decorations Too bad didn't have chance to see the park in the morning time||January 3, 2017

Helen S||50||Lived in London for 20 years and had never been on the Serpentine. We took out a pedalo, which cost £24 for a family for half an hour. It was great fun, although it's harder on the thighs than it looks! The swans are obviously used to being fed, as they made a b-line for us. Lovely way to while away a sunny afternoon.||January 3, 2017
L2912UBs||40||They sure know how to put on a carnivalThis is massive!!Rides, side booths, food, and there's the ice rinkWhy not enjoy the cold doing something fun, ice-skatingLocated within Hyde park gates close to Hyde Park Corner StationThere are queues for free entry due to security and also for the ice rink so be prepared A lot to do and a big carnival||January 2, 2017
625marinette||40||Start your London get away by a good long stroll in Hyde park. see the Londoners and tourists and open your eyes to Buckingham palace or all the century trees with fishy ponds or notice the mixité of passers by. Stop by the winter wonderland and let your child ask you for coins to get on the attractions.. no choice really, it s part of winter fun! ||January 2, 2017
BlueTravels||30||Although Hyde Park is a nice urban oasis, it is a major attraction and can get very crowded. Although rental bikes are available near many entrances, forget about it on the weekend as it is way too crowded.||January 2, 2017
Elizabeth B||40||You need mountains of energy, plenty of time, patience for long queues and good walking shoes to enjoy this attraction. It is extremely cold especially during the evening and you should be dressed very warmly ( especially tourists visiting from the Southern Hemisphere where we have hot summers now. ) The attraction boasts with many rides and entertainment for the whole family - most activities and rides have to be booked in advance. There are a huge variety of food stalls that caters for every taste. Market stalls had nice Christmas and other goodies. ||January 2, 2017
puchki2208||50||Stunning park... was a bit too cold for us to spend hours there. But we walked around the massive expanse and visited the winter wonderland nearby.||January 2, 2017

MelanieC3030||50||Visited during the winter market, which included Bar Ice and the Ice sculpture walk through...both were worth buying tickets in advance to do. In the bar everything is made of ice including the seats, tables, the bar and even the glass your drink comes in. It was an incredibly festive way to celebrate Christmas Eve! ||January 1, 2017
Annapashmina||50||We attended the Winter wonderland in Hyde Park and had a great time. Lots of fun for the family and for young people to have fun, eat junk food, take rides, play games and have a drink or two.||January 1, 2017
Ghada S||50||beautiful park , great scenery, free in the heart of london, if in winter there is the winter wonderland amusement park.. In winter the weather is cold, the rain may cause ur clothes to be muddy and there are no flowers, however it is a great place to have a walk||January 1, 2017
buzzybee2212||40||A beautiful park, serene, quiet and simply loved it when the weather is cool or cold. Good place to stroll, chitchat, relax or a jog. A good getaway from the hustle and bustle of busy life.||January 1, 2017
Janine E||50||Have been here in spring and winter and both times , I've found it to be a lovely chilled out place to go for a relaxing walk or sit down.Huge park very easily accessible from all around.||January 1, 2017
147kerenb||40||We went to Winter Wonderland as a family. We went early in the morning which I highly recommend. We got there as it opened and enjoyed walking around the market in peace. As we were leaving around 3 hours later there were very long queues to go in and it was just too busy to be enjoyed. We saw Zippo circus which I highly recommend- its great. We also went on a couple of rides and the kids enjoyed it. Make sure you go with plenty of cash - no one takes cards. There is a machine to take cash out but they charge £3.50 for every transaction. Look on the web site and pre-plan what you will be doing to get the best out of your day. Food is good and fresh (We are fussy and all found something!) but it is expensive (£6 for a slice of pizza).||January 1, 2017
Les A||50||Hyde Park is a great place to visit at any time of year. A real escape from the crowds of the city. This visit included Winter Wonderland so it was a really different experience. You can spend ages in the park with so much to see even in Winter. Must see if you are in London. ||January 1, 2017
ElizabethDonn||50||A walk through Hyde Park can take the best part of the day and is great to do in any weather conditions.Winter time has Winter Wonderland going on so an added bonus but even without its an entertaining walk.Go through and walk along the Serpentine and stop at the tea rooms. See the "Diana , Princess of Wales memorial water feature and then Kensington Palace, where she lived and where William and Kate now reside.Lots of bird life to be seen.||January 1, 2017
Terry252||50||Whether you want a jog or stroll this centrally located park is perfect and you are never more than a few minutes from somewhere decent for snacks or 5* meals. The Winter fair is proving to be a well used attraction at present but the Serpentine and Gallery are also attracting visitors as it's a break from shopping.||January 1, 2017
samy L||50||perfect for a relaxation, a goot time with the kids too! an ocean of calm in busy london, plenty of tourists as expected!||January 1, 2017
Nour_Galal||50||It's a beautiful place with all the greenery and lakes. It's just beautiful. Get toast bread with you to feed the swans and ducks, also you can get nuts to feed the squirrels there. It's just the most peaceful place, very nice to just sit and relax and start a good morning. It's also a very good place for cycling, so make sure you do that to move around hyde park and see everything. I loved this park and would go each time I visit London. ||January 1, 2017
PaulV983||40||We walked around one late afternoon. It was very busy with many tourists walking around. The sight are good. Café is good. It was cold, very cold, but it was December. ||December 31, 2016

Devonsparky||50||Went here with my children and grand children, what a great night, every body loved it, huge crowds but well managed, loads of great rides, food outlets then there is the the beer festivals for the grown ups, skating and adrenalin pumping experiences like free falling many metres from great heights!Tip:- take plenty of money you can soon rattle through a few quid in a very short period.Brilliant!||December 31, 2016
Fayhaa K||50||Fabulous place to relax, open air enjoyment. Duck lake is fabulous. You should try the English cake in the restaurant front of the lake.. never tasted before, feel like home while walking around the park .||December 31, 2016
Rahulakkara||50||The Hyde Park is the most amazing place to be in London , if you have time and just want to chill Hyde park is the place to be . Acres and acres of lush greenery and lakes and memorials this is a treat to be at. And incase u r one of those marathon runners don't forget to carry ur shoes cause ur visit to Hyde park is not complete if u don't run here ||December 30, 2016
zuzuspetals315||50||My review is limited to Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. We went at Christmas time so the Fair and Marketplace were all set up. It was so much fun. The rides were top notch and there were a lot of them. Rollercoasters that loop aren't typical for temporary carnivals. The rides were impressive. The Christmas Market was big with many stands all decorated for the holiday. Lots of foods and crafts and gifts to choose from. If you find yourself in London at Christmas in the future make sure you visit Winter Wonderland. ||December 30, 2016
OldCityJohn||50||I love Central Park and it's connection to the heart of NYC...but Hyde Park is an even more special place. During the nine days my wife and I were in London we walked through the park around six times. There were a couple of great places to eat in the park, several historical plaques and areas and lots of friendly people enjoying the scenery. I also was shocked to see that the park is home to a population of wild Parrots.||December 30, 2016
yassinfaal||50||So much fun,kids enjoyed it,we adults enjoyed it.Will go back again.Took a lot of fun rides.Place for everybody to enjoy and have a nice family outing||December 30, 2016

Amanda M||50||Lovely atmosphere and so much going on. We couldn't get to see the shows because of timings but it was lovely to wonder around in the twilight and just enjoy being there.

Oliver S||40||Being from the Antipodes one always read and heard about Hyde Park without any realisation of what it is. I decided to walk back across it to Kensington. It started to pour as I did so but that just that bit special as I had gotten my umbrella back off the Hop on Hop off buses where I had left it earlier in the day.So what is there to say about Hyde Park?It is amazing that such a large open area is in the middle of such a big metropolis. The long views and landscaping together where quite stunning. Then there was the bird life, sculptures, and waterways and just the peace and quiet after a pretty noisy busy day.||December 29, 2016

Let's try!||December 29, 2016
KLS1118||50||Our family visited Hyde park several times during a week long stay in London. The park was a 5 minute walk from our Mayfair hotel. This was a great diversion after touring museums and historical landmarks. This park has wide open spaces, beautiful quiet corners and many interesting areas to explore. ||December 29, 2016
Chris B||40||I work in Hyde Park Corner so have the park right on my doorstep so I've been out at least one lunchtime a week where I take my lunch and walk a circuit of the park. This is about 2.5 miles and can be done in about 25-30 minutes.The park is a mixture of green space for picnics or sunbathing with a large lake with boat hire and a road around the perimeter for restricted vehicles only. The park is huge so getting busy is never a worry as there is always plenty of room. There are various food kiosks around and a restaurant at either side of the lake but in my opinion the food is expensive and if you are planning to visit the buy food before you come. In the winter months they host Winter wonderland which is amazing. The first year I went was terrible however I visited a number of times this year and it's very fair to say it's been improved massively. It's not cheap but personally I am happy walking around and looking at the stunning view.I think this is a great place and worth a summer or winter stroll.||December 29, 2016
johnmM754OI||50||Jogged through Hyde Park with my son, 39 years after we visited it the first time. What a wonderful green space. We even got his picture at the Peter Pan statue...again. Love the variety of activities and judging by the numbers of people, I am not alone. I enjoyed seeing the Princess of Wales stream/fountain, or whatever it's called. One surprise was the number of parrots seen, in addition to the many other birds. I googled it, and found that there is a significant parrot population in Hyde Park, surprisingly. We also visited the Winterfest, which was very nice.||December 28, 2016
lyndanil||50||had Christmas fair on it was very good some very big rides very very big we spent a lot of hours looking round well worth a visit ||December 28, 2016
AmandaR5991||40||Really beautiful park. Huge place to have a walk around with occasional places offering food as you walk around. They only really serve hotdogs but in Winter you can get a decent hot chocolate to warm you up. Lots of nearby underground stations and very close to other tourist attractions.||December 28, 2016
Ladan F||50||Every one should go to Hyde Park. It is the place to be in London. So many places to sit, walk or have picnics and you also have Serpentine the beautiful lake in the middle. You can sit by and feed the ducks you can get a boat out. Perhaps one of the most famous memorial fountains in the world to Princess Diana is also situated there. There is a market against the gate in Bayswater road on Sunday's too. ||December 28, 2016
villamine||50||The Lido in summer is for the general public. With the interest in outdoor swimming this is a good place to start, then carry on then autumn and winter....||December 28, 2016
Oliver B||50||Walking through london I explorer Hyde park and looking at the park on a map cant show you how big the park is! Even on a busy day there is plenty of room for everyone, great views and wide range of plants.||December 28, 2016
Amin A||50||It's such a welcome breath of fresh air in any congested city centre to find a green patch but this isn't any little garden in any city! This is Hyde park! It's huge and beautiful all year round! There are lakes where you can feed the ducks and geese or simply sit back and enjoy the reflections on the lake. Watch passersby or watch out for squirrels. Take a long walk or have a lie down on the grass. Take a break from the hustle and bustle! ||December 27, 2016
TravelerJane414||50||It was lovely to walk through the gardens and people watch. We had a great time spending time watching some performers and just enjoying the variety of landscaping throughout the park.||December 27, 2016
catherined01||50||Another great place to relax by some greenery and the lake is just beautiful. I had been to Hyde Park so many times and never realised there was a lake because I always exit and enter from the same place! Silly, but now I know I try to go often. It's a very nice place to relax||December 27, 2016
brandreth16||40||A lovely park with lots to do. The famous Serpentine offers rowing boats and, for the hardier (or crazier!) amongst us, open water swimming. The park also has cafés and kiosks. Or you can just sit by the water and enjoy the scenery. Or hire one of the iconic deck chairs.||December 27, 2016
thomas p||40||Almost every season you will find a great deal of adventure in the hyde park it rambles for a large part of the park and many tops hotels l and shopping abound see you in the street or just read a news paper lovely sweets at Mayder sweet shop a bit pricey but worth the pounds!!!!!||December 27, 2016
Amrita S||40||My family and I had so much fun... winter wonderland was a lovely experience. I've been to a lot of theme parks all around the world. But I still recommend the winter wonderland experience. The ice skating, nut cracker, magical ice kingdom... etc made my winter wonderland trip mesmerizing... their are lots of shops for shopping and restaurants to have a meal also. And lots more... If ever I'm visiting at Christmas time again I would go back.||December 27, 2016
Jonesy1215||50||A really pleasant area of tranquility in the middle of London. Plenty of space to enjoy and you can forget within minutes that you are so close to so many built up areas||December 27, 2016

Mag16_12||50||We had a lovely walk through the park on a frosty December morning. It was very clean and we enjoyed seeing the Albert Memorial. Lots of room for runners, walkers and cyclists without getting in each others way. ||December 26, 2016
Julianrs||50||Fantastic park, lakes with swans / ducks , plenty of cycle paths and bikes for rental. Lovely coffee shops dotted around the park, running tracks, you name it it has it. Great for walks or jogging with the family. A must see during your stay in London. ||December 26, 2016
bowtiemarco||40||If you're close or choose a Hotel in north from HydePark and go jogging there early morning... Or go there for a walk and enjoy a nice sunset - when there's a nice weather ||December 26, 2016
890RichardF||40||Had a walk through here from Winter Wonderland to Lancaster Gate tube. Nice in the dark but not a direct line as Kensington Gardens side is locked up at night so had to then follow Carriage Drive winding around.Plenty of people about and a few groups using the park for fitness sessions in the dark - fair play to them!||December 26, 2016
Mahala C||50||Nothing like Hyde park always do beautiful to visit. Wonderful to see the animals. If you just forget your in London and open your eyes you would think you was in the countryside ||December 26, 2016
121anac||50||Being from Portugal I'm quite used to green spaces, but this park is truly something out of this world. The best part was getting to give tiny squirrels (which I saw for the first time) some nuts that I bought in a supermarket nearby. Very clean, very welcoming both for couples and families, in a true british fashion. 5 stars!||December 26, 2016
SihamD_13||50||Taking the kids there, feeding the ducks, ridding the peddle boats, going to Diana's fountains and just enjoying the scenery is an amazing idea. Coffee places are available and it's such a serene place to be in.||December 25, 2016
weikeongtan||40||Well everything is closed on Christmas Day in London. Even the underground is shut. So we took a walk at Hyde Park, surprisingly crowded although the space is big, you don't feel claustrophobic. The cool weather helps and definitely an enjoyable walk in the cool winter weather.||December 25, 2016
USEuroTraveler1977||50||Taking a walk in Hyde Park is a must. From the jewel of Kensington Palace to Diana's Memorial Fountain. The walk is relaxing, beautiful and fun. Seeing the park and families and wildlife is a great break from the hustle of the busy and crowded streets. Bring birdseed and you will make tons of feathered friends ||December 25, 2016
lenitahiraki||50||The park is big and very beautiful, even in the winter. And during the winter they have a big fun fair called Winter wonderlands, it's very busy and have a lot options of xmas typical food (little bit expensive compared to other places), but the entrance is free.||December 25, 2016
407bernhardk||50||Hyde Park is always a great place to walk a bit and enjoy nature in the middle of London and get away from the traffic. The winter wonderland in the heart of the park is the biggest traditional amusement park I've ever seen! All the rides an stalls and foods you can imagine, it's simply amazing. A must visit especially if you travel with kids.||December 24, 2016

receppas1||50||A beautiful park with lots gardens and cute animals. During winter, there is an extra attraction called Winter Wanderland that has amazing food and entertainment. Even though it was raining, we had a great time in the park, but I would still recommend you go on a day that isn't likely going to rain. ||December 23, 2016

MasieB||50||Nice to take a break from the city and have a walk or bike ride in the park, from the serpentine gallery, cafes, Italian garden fountains and monuments it's a lovely place to be and for any fans of architecture check out the late Zaha Hadid's cafe building, the scale and construction is awesome. ||December 23, 2016

Gorgeous even in winter w ample walking paths and easy to see serpentine and get to Kensington. Saw tony blairs house very near by. More galleries/museums in park we did not have time for but we will come back ||December 22, 2016
Warks4fun||10||It's a theme park. Nasty over priced food. Over priced rides. The website and Time Out overplay the Christmas theme. Christmas is incidentak.||December 22, 2016
O4851EIroberth||50||We walked through the entire park with our 1 year old child, it is a great place where a baby can sleep in the stroller. Walking along the lake is nice, there are really a lot of birds, a souvenir gift shop and you can also rent boats. When we were there, there was this Winter park with a lot of entertainment and attractions. Definitively a must to visit and to calm down from the city life.||December 22, 2016

cuddslfc||30||We went to the German style Winter Wonderland in Hyde park .Let me do the positives 1st -Very popular , fair ground rides for all levels , ice rink , food / snacks for everyones taste.Negatives -Its not cheap , we are suppose to be in a recession but looking at the prices in the wonderland someone is making lots money ......maybe its the Germans ?Curry whurst with onions £5:50Kebab - £5Mulled wine £6:50Curry & Chips £3:50Coffee £3:502 kids plus 1 adult in the fun house £15 ( 30 mins )Ice skating £20 ( 30 mins )Bag of candy floss £4This is what is Genius is getting into the Winter wonderland is free , you dont have to buy anything or go on any rides , but if you have kids , you cant do nothing and the smells of the food draws you and your wallet to the stores and to win your kids a prize is not cheap either......very clever There are even cash point machines in the wonderland - cha ching The rule is have fun but watch ur spending .||December 21, 2016

X-tina01||50||An outstanding park with lots of interesting monuments & fountains. There is an abundance of wildlife here, many species of birds. My daughter & I spent around an hour just following the squirrels, they are tame and will come up to you, one even climbed up her leg which was hilarious, never had so much fun at a park! ||December 20, 2016
Brainspin||50||I jog around Hyde park and Kensington Gardens when I am in London. If you like to meet other joggers, run counter-clockwise. If you don't, run clockwise.||December 20, 2016
SLC20132||50||During our visit, there was a great Christmas festival going on at Hyde Park. It's a huge park, we walked through it to get to Kensington Palace. Saw lots of kids playing ball games, a gathering of Pomeranians and their owners, runners, photographers, etc. Not sure what it's like late at night, but in the daytime it's bustling with fun!||December 20, 2016
grahamb611||40||Within the city this is a great place to give yourself a break.Hyde Park is big enough to be able to walk or ride a bike round, or even a horse.

We decided to take a short break a visit the hyde park, we enter the park from the gate near Queensway road. after a short walk, there was a big lake of water full will all type of ducks and geese. as soon as the ducks saw the bag they literally came to grab the bread from our hand, in a minute we were surrounded by all type of birds hope to get a bet. it was a nice experience, the kids liked it so much. The place was amazing and we really enjoyed bing in the middle of the nature.||December 20, 2016
PawelS380||40||Great place for family walks. We went to see winter wonderland but had a long walk through the park as well. Parking is expensive but you can always take a bus or tube to get there. ||December 20, 2016

Ameeta A||50||For the record, I even loved every leaf on every tree. Hyde Park lived up to my expectations. We even managed to see some anglers fish. Very fascinating how they got those big fellas on to their hooks and released them back into the lake. It was a truly memorable evening. ||December 19, 2016
Clattatio||50||Never been before never really knew it was here. But the park is breathtaking and stunning. My partner and I walked around just taking in the views and was amazing ||December 19, 2016

therealshannonthomas||50||When visiting London you should make a plan to spend an afternoon at Hyde Park. There are lots of things to see and do and also a great place to relax and watch the world go by. I love the Speakers corner. Always something going on here.||December 19, 2016
JoP20152015||40||A great fun afternoon/evening at what is a traditional fun fair. There are lots of food stalls, rides and stalls which you can win the traditional teddy bears etc. There are also some stalls which sell craft items such as candles, christmas decorations, hats, jewellery etc. IT IS HOWEVER, RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE! A ride on a basic ghost train was £9 for one adult and one child. £11 on some rides. The win a teddy type stalls were all minimum of £3 and the chances of winning were minimal -- very heavily stacked in favour of the stall owners. The food stands are pretty much without exception junk food -- there were no juice stands or stands that didn't sell chips or burgers/meat in a bread roll.I was there with my son from around 2pm until 5.30 and we spent almost £70 without any food. I don't believe I could do this if I had more than one child.||December 19, 2016
ghockley1981||50||Nice to get away from everything in central London and get some fresh air and calmness back in your life. Always enjoy a refreshing walk around Hyde Park when in London||December 19, 2016
Kiran M||40||Loved the walk through Hyde Park. Unfortunately no one was making any speeches. That would have been great. On the other hand, the Winter Wonderland park was open and hundreds of people were making their way to it. Lots of amusement park rides, etc. food stalls and Christmas market. But that is seasonal of course.||December 19, 2016
smracr||50||We were in between locations and just looking for a place to have a quick picnic lunch. We found a bench near the water and enjoyed a sunny winter day. Since it was right there, we walked around the Princess Diana memorial fountain and enjoyed the splashing birds. Of course, we had to get a photo on the bridge over the Serpentine. One thing led to another, and we ended up walking around the circumference of the entire park. We even crossed over into Kensington Gardens and caught a glimpse of Kensington Palace as the sun was prepared to set. We made it around to the Albert Memorial and realized we were back where we started. The scenery is gorgeous even in winter and the birds and squirrels were active. A fun day!||December 18, 2016
yawnhowl||50||Ran one evening after dusk, there were no lights as the park was closing, it was quiet, serene and a beautiful place to run. It felt far removed from the city.||December 18, 2016
jtsplash21||50||I love a day in hyde park. There's so much to see and do. Hire the bikes for a race round, stroll through some memoriam's, take the boat round the lake, rollerskate, go horse riding or simply picnic and read a book. There are so many famous landmarks with many different events at all times. Highly recommended||December 18, 2016
Jackielld3||40||Did not fully realise how large this lovely park was. We visited as we were going to winter wonderland which was great and we would recommend it to all. ||December 18, 2016
468queenieb||50||Lots and lots of things to do and see. Even if I spent the whole day there I wouldn't have been able to enjoy all the activities on offer.We visited the Magical Ice Kingdom which has wonderful ice sculptures. This lasted for about 30 but was long enough! The cold!!!The park was packed! lots of shops selling xmas stuff, food and drinks. The food was quite pricey though.Generally speaking it was like any amusement park only with a Christmas theme. ||December 18, 2016
femmeflamme||50||If you love parks, Hyde Park is a must visit site for your London trip. Every time I visit London, I book a day just for Hyde Park. What a great way to relax and refresh your soul ... Just stroll through the gardens, watch theSerpentine curving past, look at the swans and other birds. Gaze at Rotten Row and try to imagine what it was like in times gone by when Hyde Park was *the* place to promenade, to see and be seen. All of London is historic, but Hyde Park is truly special.It's vast, so you'll want several hours to really enjoy the park. If you are travelling with kids, this is a great place to let them tumble and play and get rid of some of that stored up energy, the birds don't seem to mind. The park is beautifully maintained in all seasons, so make ut a point to stop by to check out the latest in the landscaping!||December 18, 2016
Norwegiantraveller5||40||We went to Hyde Park a couple of times during our weekend visit. It was great to see the squirrels in the trees and on the ground. Fun for all ages.||December 18, 2016

kkattt||30||Living in London is obviously good because its easy to get to places for example hyde park, i find hyde park quite nice especially at christmas (winter wonderland) even though it does get quite busy. Although i would recommend for anyone whos never been and looking for a "action packed day" this would be good for teenagers in particular because of the rides there. Theres also a ice-scating place and lots of cute christmassy stalls and food places. Be wary though in my opinion its not cheap. Overall nice.||December 17, 2016
RCTAW||40||Once of the things I will always do when overseas was to run at the area near my hotel. Hyde Park is one of the best Ive been, similar to the Central Park in NYC. There are quite a number of attractions and cafes in the park and you will see a lot of people running in the park. It is especially nice when you run there in the cold winter when you may have a mystical feel during your run or walk in the park.||December 17, 2016
himsh||40||Good for spending some quality time in a green pasture. The part is inn the centre of London and very near to Buckingham palace. ||December 17, 2016

sagejane9||50||I visited this with my daughter while winter wonderland was there,we were not sure that it would be worth visiting,but we had some spare time and we were so glad that we went it was one of the best things that we saw,lots of stalls to buy things from and lots of fair ground attractions well worth a visit at any time of the year but extra special at christmas||December 16, 2016
Rahul M||50||This place provides such calmness and relaxation as no other place in London. The sheer size of the park is unbelievable. It is huge yet filled with vibrant people and activities.

DANIELLA107||50||The Christmas part in the park is fantastic. Colours are every where. The children 's rides are fromMarry go round to the very frightening risky wheels.Food all around. I tried the Hungarian5000 calories fried dough with so-much grated cheese . Delicious,. All in all this is a wonderful place for kids and young at heart...||December 14, 2016
Don M||40||Hyde Park is BIG. So don't rush this visit. It is a great place to stroll and unwind. On the Southern Edge is a Rotten Row, where you can often see mounted Household Cavalry riding to or from their nearby barracks and stables. Sometimes they are out just to exercise their horses. Further north you will see The Serpentine, the park's large lake, on which you can go boating. There are lots of different water birds here also. In the top NorthEast corner, on a Sunday morning you will encounter "Speakers Corner" which is an open air forum for anyone to stand on their soapbox and put the world to rights. Lot's of good humoured banter here. If you have the stamina you can also walk to adjacent Kensington Gardens where you can see The memorial water feature for Princess Diana and also Peter Pan's statue.||December 14, 2016
Michelle R||50||Love this park.Fantastic for all ages.wouod highly recommend this park in summer for families with kids.Great for picnics.Fantastic kids area ice cream and a lovely but very expensive cafe.The lido is great to and diana memorial fun Packard day out||December 14, 2016
juliet45||50||Brilliant time wandering around Winter Wonderland Seems to have more attractions each year. Plenty of food and drink, with a festive, Alpine feel, and plenty of daredevil rides. I fancy a return visit just to experience the haunted house!||December 13, 2016

jojo5757||50||Hyde Park is wonderful in so many ways. Just strolling and enjoying the beauty, or allowing your kids to run free, or enjoying the cafes (all we tried also served yummy beverages like a Pimm's cocktail). The views are magnificent and so varied, depending on where and how far you explore. There are chairs to rent and happiness everywhere! ||December 13, 2016
marianacervera||50||This place is so gorgeous, great for a walk or simply a coffee or something relaxing, loved it. You can basically do anything you want here. ||December 12, 2016
827martinob||50||This is the best big space all the family can enjoy and you can get to it from all areas we have done it from Oxford Circus and from the front of Harrods you just cut through the side street and you onto it . It's a. Kat visit you will see people riding horses people swimming in the serpentine in the summer months some even venture in the winter and great for biking and walking .||December 12, 2016
Bethrai||50||Partner and I came for a weekend away purely for winter wonderland based in Hyde Park. Winter Wonderland was great as always and Hyde Park was its usual beautiful self. Not a bad word to say. Always clean and well presented. Full of families, couples, dogs and very impressive runners! My favourite park to walk in and always will be!||December 12, 2016
Maksim G||50||The biggest park in London. Worth visiting during any time of the year. With sunny weather it is very easy to spend there at least half a day.||December 12, 2016

Also you will find the speakers corner where anyone can speak about any topic they like.The kids can also have some time to play aroundIf you have the time, don't miss it.||December 12, 2016
D0lly46||50||Had a fantastic time, it was very very busy, had to queue for everything, but well worth it, we were there Friday night from 6.00 till closing time at 10.00, all the food stalks and bars stop serving at 9.45 ||December 12, 2016
StephenB157||50||we took the family to see Zippo's Circus and the Nutcracker on Ice. Great entertainment, if not a bit expensive. Lots of fun on the rides and plenty of food and things to buy.||December 11, 2016

FiligreeBells||40||Always love a walk, run or cycle through hide park. Beautiful surroundings no matter what time of year. Easy to get to and navigate. Perfect for couples also. ||December 11, 2016
Taildragger7W||40||This is the park in all the Regency stories, so if you are an old bookworm, you have to go here. It was December, but the temperature wasn't too cold. All the Swans and waterfowl were out and begging for food. Horses galloping by, waterfall, nice walking trails and hidden spots to sit. Would love to go back in the spring.||December 11, 2016
AmandaMaryLou||50||Having visited several years running this was the first time we felt compelled to give feedback.We had a brilliant time, and on this occasion paid for the extra attractions too. Ice Bar a definite must and the Nutcracker talent was very good too. Ample choices of places to eat, drink and ignore the calorie intake for just a day. Security staff in today's age sadly a necessity to make us all feel safe; this years team we found to be professional and personable!A fantastic weekend, we will be back before New Year! ||December 11, 2016
muditcse||50||We gone to Hyde park during christmas and the visit cannot be describe in words..So electrifying and festive atmosphere.||December 11, 2016
Izziwizz||50||A nice place to just relax on the grass in with some food from the nearby restaurant. I often walk through from Kensington too oxford street and its such a lovely walk. ||December 11, 2016
Mette L||50||Hyde Park is a very big park in central London. If you need to get away from the crowds or just relax and look at something green, this is the place to go. ||December 11, 2016
MemzieCansiz||50||I have been to Hyde park many times, since 2009 it's always been so fun and exciting... Hyde park has always been my faveourite place to visit if you are with friends,family ||December 11, 2016
ChevrilGazel||50||Good for dog walks and general prambulating, cant say it knocked my socks off but when considered that its in a densley populated city - its kinda cool||December 11, 2016
Noel W||40||Lots of trinkets to buy at the Christmas markets and plenty of food to be had at the stalls. Enjoyed sitting down and enjoying a German beer. Lots of fairground rides for the kids of all ages. Really enjoyed the pet memorial near the wonderland honouring the part animals played in the world wars. Especially good if you love horses which my wife does. ||December 10, 2016
maggiemay65||50||Visited the winter wonderland - amazing. Great Christmas atmosphere. Bring cash as there are mega queues for ATM. It was very crowded so hold on to little ones hands. Book skating well in advance as it sells out quickly.||December 10, 2016
Carol19580916||50||Took a walk through the park, beautiful, parts of it had a lot of seating, lovely wildlife, managed to see the parakeets, if you take the time there are a lot of quirky things yo look out for, well worth spending the time here. ||December 9, 2016
Linnea H||50||One of the must see places in London. I've been here many times but I always find something here which impresses me.||December 9, 2016
mel s||50||Had a wonderful time. Really worth going. Take plenty of cash tho you will spend it easily. Go late to see the lights. ||December 9, 2016
gopinathp524||50||As I write its a bit dark late in the evening, otherwise I can see the part from my room window. Staying at this cute bed and breakfast called Number 63 on Bayswater Road, Hyde Park is right opposite. ||December 9, 2016
Jenny C||50||London is lucky to have a lot of parks and Hyde Park offers so much. It's almost like being in the countryside. The Serpentine in the middle - hire boats and enjoy the wild waterfowl and There's Serpentine Art Gallery, a Lido, great walking, cycling and lots of space for picnics. Outdoor concerts several times a year during the summer. ||December 9, 2016
11keeno||50||Never been to Winter Wonderland before but thoroughly enjoyed my first visit. Lots of little stools & markets, food galore, rides. Perfect for anyone to visit & have some fun. ||December 9, 2016
Khushbu9||50||This is by far the best park i have been on earth. It is one of the most serene and a beautiful place. Lush green trees all over. In the centre is a lake where live the Swans. One can also do paddle boating here. There is a lake side restuarent called Serpentine. Iv had one os the best evenings with my beau here. There are marked cycling tracks. Huge areas for kids to play.||December 9, 2016
565miguele||40||Hyde Park is one of the most historic parks in the world! I would recommend coming here in the morning to watch all the rowers practice and the swans relaxing in the pond. PRO TIP: If you're a running, this is the best place to come to in the morning, the roads are wide and there are many foot paths that are clean! ||December 8, 2016
cherrisprite||50||Scenic and great for pictures especially during holiday season with the Winter Wonderland inside! Don't miss it. ||December 8, 2016
sebastianmoody100||50||Hyde Park is just a fantastic getaway from the hectic maze that is London. Squirrels, ducks, geese, a large lake..Sunshine if you're lucky...it has it all. Plus, if it's winter time, count on Winterwonderland, a pop up amusement park with plenty to eat see and do!But really, if you're just looking for a relaxing time, taking your dog for a walk or reading a book, this is the place to go.||December 8, 2016
gadeavs||50||The Park has it all. Take the time to walk or take a run through the park. I have not been to Central Park but I imagine that it is similar.||December 8, 2016
kmlzv||50||Anything you'd expect from a park, and even more.. It's massive, it's beautiful, its full of life at any time of the year. You can walk, cycle, sit by the lake or have a coffee in a café or just stay on the grass people watching, - depends on your purpose and time of the year. ||December 8, 2016
Naji E||50||With Christmas just around the corner, Hyde Park has been transformed into a Winter Wonderland. If you are there now (December), visit the park with the whole family and have a bit of fun. Okay, not the whole park has been transformed but a good chunk of it. Enjoy :)||December 7, 2016
Indiana_Jonesse||50||Two parks in one! You can enjoy a walk at Hyde park and continue on the Kensington? Not! Well, doable but both parks are very grand. The Hyde Park covers 275 acres and though it is one of the royal parks and the largest of them all, it is smaller than Central Park of New York. The park has been a venue for many protesters.||December 7, 2016
NightAudit-Filip||50||When I walk around Hyde Park I almost feel like singing "Chim Chim Cher-ee" from Mary Poppins. This park was great during the summer, a lot of things to do, perhaps there could be one or two more places to eat and drink but overall, this is a place I will come back to many times.||December 7, 2016
damrph2016||50||Seems to be the Central Park of London. Nice place to walk and relax. Several places to eat. Enjoyable stop||December 7, 2016
brattykid||40||We were there in mid-late November and there were still fall colored leaves on the trees! The park is very large and lovely. It was fun to watch people feed the birds. There are a lot of them! There is everything from ducks to geese to swans and more. ||December 7, 2016
John V||40||We had a great time walking around the park and seeing all the sights nearby. Not expensive and relaxing. Away from the crowds. Love it. ||December 7, 2016
Evalu8||40||If you have a spare couple of hours and fancy a bit of fresh air in a lovely setting, this free park is a great place to go. A leisurely stroll around its perimeter would probably take about an hour, although there are plenty of opportunities to stop along the way, be it for a coffee or feeding the squirrels. There are plenty of birds on and around the lakes if you have an ornithological inclination, but just simply sitting and watching the world go by is a great way to enjoy this haven of tranquility in this vibrant city.||December 7, 2016
stewartconnelly||50||A nice place for meeting friends and a walk in the park the water is also very nice and the birds are interesting .I would recommend at least 3hours to visit and that won't do it justice.||December 7, 2016
gary s||40||If you fancy a breath of fresh air while on a city break and you are close enough to the Park it is well worth a walk round here. A lovely well maintained park with plenty of attractions to enjoy. Hire a bike, Winter Wonderland or Just a nice stroll.||December 7, 2016
501jeanettep||30||Called into Hyde park on Sunday 5/12/16 to the winter wonderland area. I must admit I thought it would of been larger I was quite disappointed. Had a stroll along the serpentine to the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain and found it very serene amongst the hustle and bustle of the capital, it was beautiful ||December 6, 2016
Shannonh417||50||Visited Winter Wonderland and to say it was amazing is an understatement. Staff were amazing as well as the attractions ||December 6, 2016
annttcrowe||30||If you are looking for individual craft presents you will be disappointed. The items being sold are the same as many of the Xmas craft fairs around London. I do not know if they are all part of one huge business but I expected more. On the up side the fair looks amazing, wi a huge big wheel ( a bit big for me and my fear of heights) but I am sure that lots of people will like it.||December 6, 2016
kwdestinations||30||The room was stuffy and hot. The fan in the room did nothing to help that. Not a hotel to stay in without air conditioning.||December 6, 2016
chrismoly23||50||Fantastic park, lots to see and people watch. We went to winter wonderland what an experience, very festive. The event was well organised, easy to locate events such as The Magical Ice Kingdom and the Big Wheel the views are amazing.Lots of mulled wine and browsing in the Christmas markets.||December 6, 2016
jsingh45||50||First time at the winter Wonderland and it was amazing, nice while it's light but definitely better in the dark as it really lights up the area. There's so much to do and see from quirky Christmas stalls where you can get some wonderful presents to tasty food stalls. Some really good fair ground rides to choose from caters for all and some nice places to sit and have an alcoholic beverage especially the revolving bar. It's free to enter but things like the ice bar, nutcracker show and magical ice Kingdom are at an extra charge all prices are on boards next to ticket outlets.||December 6, 2016
Tiddles25||40||First time ever being searched on way in did nt mind as rather be safe . Amazing light s and rides wonderful atmosphere . Impressed with the marshals you kept queues in order and stopped people pushing in towards front of queue||December 6, 2016
Survivory||50||A stroll in Hyde Park should definitely be included on the to-do list for anyone visiting London for the first time. Or the second, or third… The park offers many options depending on the season. Excellent for a morning run. ||December 6, 2016
danschultz||50||Very nice park. I had to get a 9 mile training run in and it was a great pleasure to run around it a couple of time with all the people, monuments, and activities going on. Want to go again in the summer and do it again!||December 6, 2016
Parkies_12||50||We visited this festive park on Sunday morning. The staff were so happy and welcoming, lots of little side stalls, no matter which entrance you used. Lots of eateries with places to sit and also enjoy a glass of mulled wine. A fairground was within the arena too. We enjoyed walking around before we hit the shops to start the real shopping! ||December 5, 2016
Missyb2012||50||Took a short walk through the park on a bright sunny day really nice big park saw some police officers grooming their horses ||December 5, 2016
Karen M||50||I never get tired of visiting Hyde Park - no matter if its because you just want to feed the swans or the squirrels or visit Winter Wonderland. The gardens are very well planned and when flowers are in bloom its very pretty.||December 5, 2016
Rachel H||50||my self and my son had a brilliant time at the winter wonderland , lots to see and do great rides for all ages , lovely Christmas market to with some great ideas for presents , lots of different foods and drink to choose from to .||December 5, 2016
Patrick N||40||A big and peaceful park. Perfect for couples to just stroll around and enjoy the atmosphere. Great for a jog also. And for dogs. Beautiful spaces. ||December 5, 2016
Michele T||40||Visited winter wonder land Sunday morning at 10 lovely easy to walk round and have a good look dont know what it would be like at night extremley bizzy i expect||December 5, 2016
Gml26||50||This place must be gorgeous all the time, but during the winter festival it was magical! Lots to do for kids and adults...rides, food, shopping, games. It was enjoyed by my in-laws, my husband and I, as well as our kids.||December 5, 2016
Roy S||40||Winter wonderland what can i say ? Never again it was manic and you couldnt enjoy with the size of the crowds ||December 5, 2016
Ptb48||50||Just a quick visit , very scenic , lots of birds on the lake. Not timid.Went to the Winter Wonderland , very festive . They've got a small theme park there.||December 4, 2016
STluton||50||Lovely place and was only a short walk from my hotel The Continental Hotel. The best bit is the fountains||December 4, 2016
T4655GEnicolem||40||Winter Wonderland was amazing! Would definitely recommend a visit if you are going to London during the festive season. I would say go early because it gets very busy and crowded as the day goes on. ||December 4, 2016
GarryC342||30||Came to London especially to visit the winter wonderland and have to say that we were both disappointed with our visit. If you want to get drunk and stuff yourself stupid with alcohol and food then this is somewhere for you to visit. There was also a big fair there to. What it was lacking was Christmas stalls. What was there was a few nice stalls but these were duplicated all around. For us it lacked imagination and needs to go back to roots. Other things were good but the emphasis has been lost. More needs to be done to take it back and put more market in ||December 4, 2016
Dan V||50||Hyde par is beautiful, a green oasis in the city. At this time of the year there's lots of leaves on the ground which add to the place's beauty. There's also a Winter Wonderland fair with lots of rides, food and souvenirs which is excellent for a family day out if you don't mind the cold. Food is expensive and unhealthy though, so be prepared.||December 4, 2016
hm-adventure07||50||Lovely stroll in the cold weather. Amazing time. We got to walk along the water and see the ducks on route to winter wonderland||December 4, 2016
Mary M||50||Beautiful and quiet place in the middle of a noisy and always bussy city. Well designed and cared for taking a walk, enjoy and relax.||December 4, 2016
Bigmamma54||50||Just wow!!! It's absolutely huge. Loved looking around the little market stalls and the eating and drinking places. Lots to see and do. Entrance is free but things like the shows and the ice rink cost extra. It's one of those attractions where it pays to do your homework online and pre-book tickets for the variety of activities. It really does add the the Christmas celebrations. ||December 4, 2016
Fergie A||50||We went three days ago, it was soooooooooooo great. Be sure you will take bread or pop corn or food with you to feed the birds and some nuts to feed the squirrels. Of course don't miss Winter Wonderland which is nearby. If you are going this time of the year don't forget to dress well cause after the sun goes down it's freeeeeezing. You will have a lovely time either you are family,or a couple, or with friends!!||December 4, 2016
256ollie||50||Hyde Park is a lovely park in London. When I lived in London, I'd walk here everyday. The scenery, structure and water is stunning. Love the pond with all the gooses and the birds, etc. I would highly recommend it here!||December 4, 2016
freddiemgreen||50||You must go to Hyde Park! It is very peaceful, calm and busy. You can see ducks and swans and feed them. It is a "must" location in London!||December 3, 2016
SharryD89||50||I LOVE visiting this park whenever I am in London. It is located right next to Knightsbridge and is well worth the visit. It is quite big, very clean, and is perfect for people of all ages and people of all shapes. You will find gardens, lakes, a carousel, and many other things around this park. Definitely a good escape from the hustle bustle of the city!!||December 3, 2016
Shahanks||40||This is a good park to roam around during sunset time. The duck, squirrels, pigeons are a sight not to miss.||December 3, 2016
paulharhen||50||This is an enormous event. And unusually it is well organised. Activities for all ages, from toddlers to the elderly. My favourite was the ice rink. Some of the participants were dressed in festive or colourful gear. There were also some huge beer halls with continuous live music. A must see experience. The security staff were very evident. And the toilets were free and clean. ||December 3, 2016
markthedarktrooper||50||This park is amazing! I saw a squirrel and we managed to feed a very weird looking black bird in the water area. On a sunny day it's a very nice way to kill some time, and the people there seemed friendly and with a smile on their faces.||December 3, 2016
AnnieEz||50||This free-to-enter event was a great evening out with family and friends. In its tenth year, its bigger than ever with food, drinks, winter markets, fairground rides, and ice skating. We really enjoyed the grilled brats but the hot cider wasn't enough to keep us completely warm - don't forget your heavy coat, muffler, hat and mittens or you will likely freeze to death. If you are old enough to drink, you can take advantage of one of the indoor themed taverns to gain a bit of warmth. The vendors are selling lots of Christmas ornaments and tchotchkes and it's a good place to come up with gift ideas. Expect to have your bags searched upon entry. Adult beverages can't leave the venue. The event runs through early January. This was my first visit to Hyde Park at night. Because of the carnival atmosphere the place was lit up like a Christmas tree and twinkling all over - quite satisfying. All in all, good fun. My only warnings are beware the fairy floss candy. Pink is NOT the traditional vanilla flavor I expected, but instead an icky strawberry; and, there are lines for the ladies WC so don't wait until the last minute, if you know what I mean. ||December 3, 2016
El L||50||I go to the park every day it's a great place to get out and relax see people , grab a hot chocolate and feed the ducks and squirrels . I always meet tourist and chat to them , plenty to do there . ||December 3, 2016
KingMicky||50||I spent many a weekend strolling along the Serpentine. Even in the winter, its an impressive park right in the heart of London. Nice place to relax and watch the world go by ||December 3, 2016
pcr4546||50||Well we took the opportunity to take a walk through Hyde Park past Kensington Palace, it was so relaxing on this frosty, sunny morning even though it was quiet busy with joggers and other walkers but the road/path is so wide it was not a problem and our walk will remain one of the many highlights of our 4 day trip to London ||December 3, 2016
Kelli35||50||Winter wonderland in Hyde park is a must if your visiting it's really great for family's of all ages. Some lovely little markets. Daytime was nice but it comes alive at night ||December 3, 2016
Stuey1985||40||We visited here while at winter wonderland as we walked through on the way to harrods it's a peaceful park the lake is beautiful and full of swans and ducks there's a coffee shop which is right next to the lake so you can enjoy a drink whilst admiring the view ||December 3, 2016
EricBzr||40||Nothing better than a stroll through the Park when the weather's fine, but it can also be enjoyable in the rain. Peace and quiet in the heart of the city. Some ornamental gardens to see. Also, The Serpentine Lake , which has some cafes nearby. Whether it's your first visit to London or a return visit, make sure it's part of your intinerary.||December 3, 2016
Q8i13||50||I love Hyde park so much from my childhood till now , Really I feel so good when I walking in the park. ||December 3, 2016
HannahLamond||50||Hyde Park has something for everyone! In the Summer you can read, walk, run, ride a bike, bird watch, rent a canoe, have a picnic or just enjoy the view. When Winter comes the park is magically transformed into a Winter Wonderland! Definitely worth a visit! ||December 2, 2016
ZG1067||50||Hyde Park is a great place to get some exercise or just wonder around and relax. There are pathways all over the park that lead to all sorts of destinations like Kensington Palace, Royal Albert Hall, and Westminster, home of Big Ben, Westminster Abby and Buckingham Palace. This is really a country setting in the middle of a large city. Very nice!||December 2, 2016
Vickyw789||50||We visited Hyde Park on Sunday 28/11/16 to visit winter wonderland we did visit last year too. This attraction is well worth a visit especially if you go late afternoon early evening before it gets too busy. It had lots of market stalls with very interesting things for sale also lots of bars and places to eat. Also lots of fairground rides. I did enjoy walking around but found most things very very expensive but seeing all the festive lights and decorations was lovely. I'm sure I will visit again next year. ||December 2, 2016
Silviub333||50||This is one of the things to do when you are in London. This park is awesome and you can see a lot of bio-diversity. Try it and I am pretty sure that you will like it!||December 2, 2016
AngelaTraveler||20||I should rent a bike. There are so many bikes in the park for rent for a very cheap price. Too big to walk.||December 1, 2016
soaj97||50||Wonderfully easy way to get around the whole park is on bike, made for a really lovey and very pretty journey. wonderful and interesting park! ||December 1, 2016
thor2705||50||We've got to Hyde Park just in time to see the cavalry passing. Impressive. Walking in this park in the morning is an interestin experience. Great landscaping and beautiful statues and water fountains.||November 30, 2016
zam2310||50||When you have been hit by the crazy eruption of human traffic on Oxford street or Egeware Road, head to Hyde Park and sit on the grass to catch you breath and watch life happen around you from the lushness of the grassed floor. Where London is a hyper ventilating fast paced heart, Hyde park is its beauty sleep. ||November 30, 2016
Ann H||50||November is not the perfect time to be outside in drizzly London but it was fun to contemplate the "swells" in their carriages out to be seen! We had a quick bite to eat in the restaurant by the lake and the food was good. It is a beautiful park and when we were there the Winter Wonderland was in full-swing. The Wonderland is a combination pub, shopping arcade and amusement park rolled into one. It was free to enter and a lot of fun! Beware it is very crowded in the evenings! And the tube in both directions is crammed!||November 30, 2016
Stephanie S||50||There's room for everyone here, and if just walking or jogging the many paths is not your thing you can visit ponds and sail miniature boats, view wildlife, or walk through decorative gardens. Some time in the open fresh air did me good after a lot of time in the midst of the buildings, traffic, and crowds elsewhere in the city. ||November 30, 2016
KayleighM94||50||Beautiful, extensive grounds with so many activities going on. Great upkeep and care keeping the grounds sharp and attractive definitely worth a visit.||November 30, 2016
PETER B||50||Much like Central Park in Manhatten, Hyde Park, Green Park, and St James Park are a welcome oasis from the busy tourist spots. Lots of refreshment stands and toilets available. ||November 30, 2016
narrating||50||whenever I visit Hyde Park I am captured by the strong impression I had the very first time (of hundreds!) I visited it, several years ago. It is like opening a magic door to the country from the middle of the hectic city life. When you are in the middle of the park, with the pound and the ducks the city is soon forgotten. Hyde Park is full of surprises, exhibitions, initiatives, people, groups... wandering around is always an adventure.||November 30, 2016
miaokanawigi||50||If you wanna enjoy walking and thinking about something this place suits you most. However, please be careful as some cases of pickpocketing may occur here on timely basis. This is very touristy place which unfortunately attracts pickpocketers.||November 29, 2016
510thomasj||50||The winter wonderland was amazing really liked spending time there a must see in london during the festivities ||November 29, 2016
tinalJ855OG||40||i like all these parks with lakes and ducks. it is a bit good to visit it in the winter but i heard that the christmas market is quite nice.||November 29, 2016
V5967VDclaudiac||50||I fell in love with this park. It's very beautiful and there are so many squirrels around, they are very cute and adapted to get close to people. It was nice to stop there when we were tired of walking and get relaxed in this beautiful area of London ||November 29, 2016
simyrela||50||it was amazing.I love London during Winter.we had so much fun and we ate so much.The only downside is that it is kind of expensive ||November 29, 2016
hakanjorgensen||50||Very impressive amusement park during the winter. Nice and easy to access by tube or bus. Nice location ||November 29, 2016
ggak||40||like all the parks in London this was another nice walk through. It was in late fall, but still a nice walk to get a feel for the city of London. Just walk around and look around at some of the history. Take your time as London is fast paced||November 29, 2016
tracier944||40||Nice walk to Kensington and the winterwonderland nice to sit watch the squirrel in the tree running about or go on your bike see the swans on the lake||November 28, 2016
Cristabolito||50||Very well maintained park in Central London. Very relaxing place in summer time and very pretty during winter time when Winter Wonderland is working.||November 28, 2016
katherinep990||40||Absolutely fabulous what wonderful time we had here loads to see and do, really got us in the mood for Christmas ||November 28, 2016
Ella A||50||A stroll in the park... lovely... even on a cold-freeze day. To visit the Kensington Palace is a must. Skip the gardens if you visit in November, as I did.||November 28, 2016
anacpap||50||I like Hyde Park as it can combine, Nature - Sports - Recreational Events and Peace at the same time! Worth visiting any time of the year!||November 27, 2016

HENssl||40||My son and I ran here one morning -- great spot -- beautiful scenery and you can cross over into Kensington Gardens as well. Family took a stroll the following day that all enjoyed despite a stiff breeze. Very central with multiple tube stops on the perimeter so walk to your hearts content then jump in the Tube and head to your next spot.||November 27, 2016

dlking0410||40||I usually stay close to Hyde Park, while in London. The park is lovely, any time of year. Strolling through Kensington Gardens, Kensington Palace, the Elvin Garden, the Serpentine, the duck pond or just sitting on a bench and reading. A great way to spend a few hours. ||November 27, 2016
stuartbY343OA||40||Park was cold in the winter. Would be nice in the summer. Absolutely huge to walk!!!!!There. There. Jamboń???||November 27, 2016
pepics||30||To be honest, it is rather a winter-themed amusement park with loads and loads of people. Lots of food stalls and different (crazy) rides. If and when you go there, enjoy the excitement and adrenalin but don't expect christmas spirit.It is a problem to get to tube at the closing time because of the amount of people. Yesterday, the Marble Arch station was packed so that people were queueing outside on the stairs. We walked to the next station Bond Street. There was hardly anyone. When the tube arrived, it was half empty! It must be that it didn't stop at all at Marble Arch for safety reason. I felt pity for the people waiting for the tube there but very happy for myself.So, might be better to visit a bit earlier and then leave before the others.||November 26, 2016
ChrisM1960||40||Visited late one afternoon as it was drizzling, but gorgeous, verdant & kept up impeccably. Beautiful place for a stroll.||November 26, 2016

Amy B||50||My partner lived vertially on the park and I never got bored of walking around the beautiful lake. The Serpentine Cafe is situated on the park and is a lovely meeting place, somewhere to grab a quick drink or even have lunch. The park is always blooming no matter what time of the year. It's nice to escape the city and make peace with nature, the wildlife makes the park look even more spectacular. ||November 25, 2016

93pamb||50||Walked through Hyde Park on our way to winter wonderland. Beautiful Italian gardens, lots of very friendly squirrels and ducks/geese. Amazing to have such extensive open space in the middle of big city. It was a weekend, so lots of horse riders, runners, walkers, skaters and cyclists all happily enjoying the open space, and my son was happy as there were plenty of Pokémon to catch! If you are in the City, give it a visit for some time away from the hustle and bustle. ||November 24, 2016
keanekn||40||Winter wonderland is basically a German Christmas market combined with a fair. The whole facilities wore very clean and tidy. It was well run with security guards on the entrance checking all bags. The stalls were very pretty and there is the chance to pick up a different gift that bouncing get in the shops. Th attraction was brilliantly lit up. So pretty!. The only thing that was off putting for us was the price of the rides. Some as much as eight pounds for one person .||November 24, 2016

RobsLaw||50||I have been through it three times now. It is beautiful. We ran around it and through it on Saturday morning. It was not crowded at all at 7:30. On Sunday we walked through it at 8:40. It was busier than the day before. We walked back through it at 10:30 and stopped at Kensington Palace. It was busier than before but still not crowded. It was absolutely gorgeous at all times.||November 23, 2016
bradp582||40||Hyde Park is absolutely beautiful. Whatever the season, it's always nice to come here and see a huge green space in the middle of bustling London. Recommended for anyone who wants to escape the hustle and bustle of London for a while. Maybe take a trip on a pedalo or rowing boat on the lake for a small fee (which also is awesome!)||November 23, 2016
simi1999||50||Nice to go to chill with friends or for a nice relaxing walk. Also feeding the duckies and chasing them with peddleboats is fun.||November 23, 2016
WendyF135||50||We spent a happy afternoon walking through the park, admiring the autumn colours, watching the people, and generally relaxing with our family. The sculptures and lakes, the magnificent refurbished Albert Memorial, and general atmosphere are not be missed and I would recommend a visit to everyone visiting London.||November 23, 2016
Laura-Jane P||50||Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park is just magical! It is absolutely huge with so many attractions, carnival games, food options, bars and stalls. I was surprised at the price of everything too, I was expecting extortionate prices however it was pretty reasonable. I would highly recommend the carousel bar - it was great fun! Only down side is that it is a little muddy and wet in places so I would recommend suitable footwear! All in all - great fun for any age!||November 23, 2016
roger m||50||Enjoyed strolling around the park and renting a boat on th serpentine. A lot of green space to play ball or to just walk.The location ( not far from all the main attractions in London) ||November 23, 2016

Ann M||50||Visited Hyde Park recently on a weekend break. Beautiful gardens and the famous Serpentine full of swans and canada geese. This time of year there is Winter Wonderland, which is a mixture of German xmas market & fairground rides, and lots of food stands. It also has an ice rink. Hyde Park is then close to Oxford street?Regent street for shopping, or you can walk through the park and into kensington gardens and then of course the Palace.||November 23, 2016

_jamietsmith59||50||A huge park, especially great in summer. I have been here quite a lot and it's a very social area.

Red571||50||You must go here it is just so lovely, we went here on a morning walk and the nature, the wildlife it was all so refreshing after days of being emmersed in the concrete jungle of London. One of the best experiences grab a coffee while you go theres little shops around bring some bread for the swans. What an experience!||November 21, 2016

Phoenixm34||50||Visited primarily to see the Winter Wonderland (wouldn't recommend) but Hyde Park is beautiful. Very relaxing just strolling round. We met some incredibly friendly squirrels who would take food from your hands. Beautiful, relaxing and a wonderful free attraction in the centre of London ||November 21, 2016
Johnherd||50||This is a lovely place to enjoy the lawns, woodland creatures and take a load off. There are public washrooms available for 20P. The Mall alongside the park is where the royal guard marches past for the changing of the guard if you can catch it!||November 20, 2016
MULCASTER2||50||Wether you are just walking through it on route to shopping or meandering through the area - you must walk in Hyde Park. From the wealth of wildlife to the amazing little stalls you will not be disappointed. Remember to take nuts for the squirrels - even though they are grey.||November 20, 2016

Linda H||50||Just come back from here went to winter wonderland.we went on first night and it was very busy .never seen as many people.plenty to do but wouldn't go back as gets too busy and you can't see everything as too many people.||November 20, 2016
mebf78||50||Start your journey in Kensington Gardens, and do the two parks, you will see so many things: Albert memorial, Lady Di playground and memorial, Serpentine gallery, Peter Pan statue, Herry Moore Arch, Italian gardens, Iris sculpture, Speakers Corner. You can do it in sunny, cloudy or raining days, in all occasions is charming! Couples hours, good shoes and good pace :)||November 20, 2016
loopylorn||50||Free to get in , winter wonderland has a huge amount of fairground rides and lots of European stalls. Traditional charming wooden structures with lots of twinkly lights. We went to the Bavarian village which was enormous with traditional German gluwein and beer. With currywurst and bratwurst. Live music was great fun too. The ceiling of the huge Bavarian village had some gorgeous Christmas lights which were quite mesmerising ! The atmosphere inside was lovely.They have lots of long tables and benches. Grab a seat and soak up the atmosphere and make new friends ! Or keep yourself to yourself. They also had "proper " toilets which I was not expecting at something that is not a permanent fixture ||November 20, 2016
Clare D||40||Great music bit over rated to what it is but would never take children to busy and need lots of money ||November 20, 2016

Margie C||50||Every time we visit we love to walk through the park. It's been so nice to be out starting the day with crisp, morning air, autumn leaves, squirrels gathering nuts (so funny!).

JapaneseGardens2017||40||We visited Hyde Park in London in June 2016. You can get a very good overview of the Park by walking from the North entrance down to the South entrance, passing the Serpentine and the Princes Diana Memorial. At the south end you are well situated to go on to visit the Royal Albert Hall and the Science Museum, then on to the main part of South Kensington, where there are several very good restaurants, and then on to Knightsbridge to visit Harrods.||November 18, 2016
chadd m||50||beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. A must do from the busy tourist activities. Just walk, sit or laze on the lawn. Coffee shops. the squirrels and birds are amazingly friendly. They even sit on you. what a delightful day we spent here.||November 18, 2016

RJH1975||40||Hyde park is huge, its nice in central London to have some open and green space. Nice ponds with ducks as well. Take your walking shoes.||November 15, 2016
astheduckflies||50||I always try to visit Hyde Park when I go to London , anytime of year it feels quintessentially British , a place where the modern world and the traditional blend in a quiet sort of harmony , accompanied by the sounds of bird life on the lakes.there is always something to see or do, in summer grab a deck chair , have a picnic , listen to a band or watch other events that go on in the park, feed the ducks, go cycling and see all forms of London life pass you by.In the autumn and winter enjoy walking and taking in the change of seasons on a crisp sunny day. Go and look at the art both old and new , so much is available to see and experience that you could quite easily use up a whole day here regularly while needed to relax from the fast pace of living or visiting in london.It is great for activities and green gym workouts too if you want to know how the people of London live and be like them , visit their parks rather than places like Leicester Square or Oxford Street.||November 15, 2016
Daniel H||40||I highly recommend Hyde Park as the best central London has to offer open-space wise. There are many signposts throughout, however toilets are very far and few.||November 15, 2016
OdoneMoojen||50||Hyde Park is a world famous park to have a walk, to relax or to spend a nice good time.There are in the park two galleries, The Serpentine Galleries which are unmissable ||November 15, 2016
S827KFjoew||50||The park is used by residents of London and contains excellent Gardens, horse trails, a lake and walking paths. It is large. One can always find a food and drink vendor, or an ice cream. In the morning, the cavalry troop down the horse trail for the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace and the gardens down by Kensington Palace are well tended and change with the seasons.||November 15, 2016

evelynhenke||50||Hyde Park is my landmark when I stay in London. As I rule I walk, and what better place to go for a walk than in the gardens and pathways of Hyde Park. Always feel safe and relaxed. And I take time to smell the flowers in the beautiful gardens. ||November 14, 2016
Heidi D||50||Hyde Park is a lovel getaway in the heart of London. Take a walk through the gardens and along the water to feed the ducks. It is a ovely way to relax in the city.||November 14, 2016
wanderer_scotland||50||Me and my wife were having a long weekend away in London. I had stayed near Hyde Park before and this time we were staying in the Cumberland Hotel at Marble Arch.After a long day crammed in tubes and buses, and being knocked from side to side on Oxford street, it was good to just stroll through Hyde Park on a nice autumns evening, making our way from Marble Arch across to the Albert Hall.||November 14, 2016

LoisP995||50||We stayed in a hotel which was quite close to the Royal Albert Hall and all we needed to do was walk straight through the park.This was perfect until trying to get back to the hotel after the performance.We entered the park fine but once across to the other side , we found we were locked in.This certainly was not that obvious on entering but a lovely long walk anyway x ||November 13, 2016
Sarah D||50||Hyde Park is a must see on a sunny day. I rented a bike and went around the whole park. Then I sat down by the water to have some of the best waffles that i've ever had in my life for 5£. You can really spend a great afternoon there for a picnic or a walk/bike tour. A must see in London :) ||November 13, 2016
Rob B||50||Hyde park is a great place to get away from the hassle of a busy London. With so much to see and plenty to do. Grab lunch from one of the local cafes and find a good spot to just people watch. ||November 13, 2016
robertamilagres||50||Good place to take amazing photos and spend the day. I went in spring and fall and both times were so pretty! ||November 12, 2016
GoffageTrioThree||50||After days of sightseeing, we decided to spend a day discovering some of the gorgeous parks that London has to offer and to give our 11 year old son some time to run, jump and play.Of course, we only strolled through part of Hyde Park because it covers 350 acres and houses some famous landmarks such as the Serpentine Lake, Speakers' Corner and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain.There were people swimming in the lake (there is a very old swimming club) and there were so many white swans which are just magnificent. There were also people boating and horse riding. We don't get these activities in our parks in Australia.We had a gorgeous morning tea at the Lido Bar & Café which is near the swimming club. The scones and tea were beautiful and we got to sit and admire the magnificent swans some more.We followed the Princess Diana Memorial Walk for a small distance which is marked by beautiful brass markers in the ground and her Memorial Fountain is beautiful as well as the playground.There are many chestnut trees and squirrels, and our son collected a backpack full of chestnuts and spent a lot of time feeding the gorgeous little squirrels, which would run up to him and take them gently from his hands and then run off to bury them in the ground nearby. We loved this.||November 12, 2016
brianmeryllm||50||Tennis courts,horse riding track,lawn bowls, Diana Princess of Wales fountain turned off for winter (would be great for summer activities).Charming Refreshments pavilions. Car park. Pleasant walk along Serpentine.||November 12, 2016
Naz42||40||On the Sunday 6th November we visited the park. Amazing place but it started raining and it was bit hard to find princess Diana memorial.The park so big as we walked around 1500 steps in one day around the area.||November 12, 2016

jg3arrow||50||There is something for everyone to enjoy in Hyde Park, which is, I suppose to London, what Central Park is to New Yorkers. Much more rustic and unspoilt than Central Park, however. Walking trails, biking trails, dog walking areas, picnicking, boating, sitting, sleeping, or just wandering. It covers a huge expanse on the west side of downtown and runs all the way to Kensington. Free to walk and enjoy at all times. Each season is a wonder of beauty, in its own right.||November 11, 2016
Devjani G||50||We went there on our way to the Buckingham Palace; Its green all over; neat & clean. There's a waterbody inside the park and one can see ducks swimming there. Ice creme & coffee shops are there in a corner of the park.||November 10, 2016

60alexandra||40||Gold must go the the beautiful St James but that's just my opinion. Hyde Park is way bigger and there always seems to be something going on. Winter wonderland is now a popular annual event. You can ride a horse or row a boat. Visit the wonderful Seprpentine Gallery and take tea in the amazing new cafe. Above all enjoy this enormous leafy space in the very heart of London. We are so lucky to have it.||November 9, 2016
Laura B||50||On my recent visit to London I was staying directly across the street from Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. I walked in the park every day, several times crossing it's entire length and width more than once a day. It was delightful, a refreshing escape from the traffic and crowds. The gardens are so nice and as it was autumn, the trees were beginning to change their colors. There are many interesting memorials, fountains and statues to see. Don't miss the Albert Memorial, located in Kensington Gardens.||November 9, 2016

LOLI very much like the cycle hiring system in London.The machine is easy to operate and tourists can use it as long as you have a valid credit card.You can even download the app which you can use to check nearby docking stations and how many bikes / spaces that station has.So unlikely you will get to a station which has all its bike rented or all its bike returned.In Hyde Park, we started at the Black Lion Gate which is closer to the Kensington Gardens.But after we paid with our credit card, we found out that machine receipt paper is run out.So we paid again in another machine and the passcode paper can be printed successfully.(So we paid double ><!!!!)Anyway the bike is easy to handle - you can easily adjust the seat, to be specific and you can put your bag in front of the bike.Be reminded the park has a specific route for cyclist, don't cycle on other roads and it is very annoying and dangerous.But I am also surprised to see how UK people ride their bike.Some were talking on phone, some were looking at their phones, some were riding like drunk people....And there are a few sessions that the road is quite narrow, so honestly I didn't quite enjoyed it.We cycled across the whole Hyde Park and finally returned our bike at the Hyde Park Corner docking station.It is very easy to return, just need a bit more strength to push the bike into the dock and make sure the red light is one before leaving.The weather was super fine when we cycled.So I saw people doing picnic, napping on grass, chilling next to the lake etc...A very spacious park full of greenery where you can relax. ||November 9, 2016
johnlliving||50||Its a great relaxing venue with ample space, clean and tidy and well maintained. Within walking distance of Baker street, Oxford Circus, Marble arch, Edgeware road, and has several buses to Victoria station||November 8, 2016

Londonnettee||50||Its so peaceful and relaxing, even if there is a bunch of people around, there is plenty of space so it still feels amazing to walk around the park and see different animals and birds. Very relaxing!||November 8, 2016
TWINN66||40||THis is a great spot and location for a walk in the middle of London but the feeling is like you are on the countryside. ||November 8, 2016
Kas H||50||The sculpture in and around the park is a feast for the eyes. The Edinburgh Gate mythical creatures running to the park, the fountain, the horse, and many more. Delightful place to walk or ride a Boris bike. Gorgeous in the fall and spring. Safe.The history is awesome! The marble arch area used to be...Tyburn Gibbet||November 8, 2016
AlejandroGavino||50||This is really a good park to walk, to do picnic or just see, a lot of people and pets here because it has some awesome views, for sure you will enjoy a walk here.||November 7, 2016
RegNZ||40||Certainly a must do when in London. There are several entrances and it certainly is a large park. Get a tube there and pack a picnic to sit by the lake.||November 7, 2016
JPuttmanJr||50||My buddies and I went to London on quick excursion while in England for Business. Our first attraction was a walk in Hyde Park. It seems much of London was in the same mood. But there was enough space to roam, people watch and enjoy the grass, trees and water. Well worth the time spend. ||November 7, 2016
Anna_Petrovna1937||40||We stayed to the outer edges because cyclists aren't allowed to through the park, but it was a wonderful park with gorgeous scenery. ||November 7, 2016
meganbee09||40||I liked how much wildlife there was there and appreciated that there was some seating if required. Would definitely recommend a visit ||November 7, 2016
Nicoleta J||50||It is one of the best places in London to relax and have a nice time with your couple or friends. We were there with some friends and suddenly started a nice concert.||November 7, 2016
Gitana_soul||50||Used to read about this place in almost all of classic novels particularly historical romance..and I got a chance to visit this during winter wonderland..for me it lived upto my expectation..the place was sooooo lively and full of lights, people, chocolates,waffles and what not..and the best part was ski jump ride..will make you scream at the top of your voice...||November 7, 2016
blincb||50||When we vacation in England, we always ensure we stay in London for a few days before we return home. We always stay in Bayswater and as a result have ready access to Hyde Park. We love walking through the park (luckily the weather has usually cooperated). It is so enjoyable and relaxing strolling through the park, along the Serpentine, stopping for a coffee or lunch at the park restaurant, visit Kensington Palace, peruse the artists if we're there on a Sunday. We thoroughly enjoy every opportunity to see Hyde Park. ||November 7, 2016
diegoJ574DB||40||As it's becoming usual, London has a lot of magnificent Parks.And Hyde Park is one of them. Located in the heart of the city, good place to come in on a sunny day, bringing a book, meeting with friends or having a nice afternoon with family.It's pretty big, although not the biggest, and if you come on a sunny day, it will definitely be overcrowded.||November 7, 2016
hamadabdulla||50||hyde park is a big park. It is really popular for both tourists and locals in London. It is just a park with trees and lovely people. it will be great if you get a hotel near that park. Its great for families with children. It is great for having a day of relaxation there and reading books. In my perspective of this park it is highly recommended for tourists coming to London.||November 7, 2016

andreasmuller||50||Noise and traffic all around , but once you're in the Park you can relax. Want to try to be an orator, hop on a box and make a speech at Speakers' Corner||November 6, 2016
kjh1702||50||Although it was November the weather was great and we took a nice walk through Hyde Park. The trees were in autumn colours with squirrels running around looking for peanuts from passers by ! The bird life on the pond was pretty impressive with Pelicans and Black Swans. ||November 6, 2016

Joanne N||50||If you're visiting London for the first time, you need to visit Hyde Park. Been here many times and there's a lot of space to explore. Speakers Corner is always entertaining!||November 5, 2016
Debra H||50||Lots to see and do,it's like an open air museum. Hand feed the squirrels. A must for kids to enjoy the wide open space of London.||November 5, 2016
Conneggio||50||This is one of the best parks I've seen and enjoy. It's big and well kept. A great place to enjoy with your family, friends or partners. Perfect to stroll around and picnic where allowed. Worth visiting the Speaker's Corner by the Marble Arch.||November 5, 2016

ashley b||50||The scenery is magnificent, the walk along the pond is nice. Walk through the kensington gardens if you get a chance.||November 4, 2016
wendy_hulse||50||We visited Hyde park on sunday as the kids love feeding the birds and squirrels and have learnt the names of so many birds from our visits. We always take a big bag of monkey nuts to hand feed the squirrels. We got an added bonus on this visit as some of the wild green parrots that are now resident in the park have become very tame and will eat food (monkey nuts) right out of your hand. The kids loved it! The newly installed cycle highway has made the footpaths so much safer to walk on and you no longer have to constantly look over your shoulder for cyclists (or listed to that irritating bike pell ping). The park is always spotlessly clean and perfect for picnics in the summer. It is always our first port of call on our frequent day trips to london||November 4, 2016
Céline C||50||I'm a huge fan of parks, probably because I live in a country where there are almost no parks, so I make it a point to visit parks wherever I go. Hyde Park is huge and just awesome for a walk and a halt for some refreshments. Just enjoy a small escape there before you head back to discover the rest of the city.||November 4, 2016
fuzzyspit||50||We hanged out at Hyde Park on a cloudy afternoon, after our visit to the Buckingham Palace. The place was huge and we prepared a small bag of nuts to feed squirrels. There are plenty of spaces for people to sit down and have a picnic, or simply to read a book. We proved to be very popular with the squirrels and pigeons, after they discover our food stash. Definitely worth a visit and||November 3, 2016
JanetR2216||50||So beautiful, peaceful and uplifting. Such a gem in busy, bustling London. Perfect for the family after an over-stimulating couple of days as busy tourists. I make a point to take a run through the park every time I'm in town. (With added hopes of stumbling upon a royal, but that's beside the point!) ||November 3, 2016
N8373EJgrahamc||50||Hyde Park is that alternant escape from the crazy buzz of London, Great just to take an hour of your time and get some fresh air in the green park walking around the lake||November 3, 2016
jamessS9729YS||50||This is a very large park. It is great for couples and for families alike. The landscaping is very beautiful and the location is excellent. It is good for walking, running or biking. Speakers Corner is at the northwest corner of the park and a great place to listen to various speeches on Sunday's.||November 3, 2016

ColinP96||50||Great place for a picnic. Check out if anything is going on at the bandstand. The lakes are terrific, the waterfowl beautiful. The antidote to a crazy busy Buckingham Palace or Houses of Parliament. Great for cycling too||November 3, 2016
bearnard r||50||I took a walk while in London capital, this park is located next to pinces gate and palace gate to the end side. very fresh and clean air , waterways and swan and duck ponds were next to the greenery. love it truly||November 3, 2016
DivaGoldCoast||40||Very suprised at how big this park is, we were here later in the day a d it was really nice to see people out and about enjoying the fresh air and sunshine.One gripe......... not enough public toilets||November 2, 2016
JoanneJuliett||50||I will star with "first time", because it was not only once, I will let you figure out why. One word for this park: amazing! I've been there during the day, during the evening, in the night, every time was different in a beautiful way. One of the most interesting and beautiful thing si about the swans, a lot of them, huge and magnificent. I had a boat trip on a sunny day aswell. Simply the best. A lots of animals, a lots of people, and the most important NATURE, in the middle of the city. Excellent! Big up! ||November 2, 2016
samdO7679MH||40||The is one of the places must visit if you have kinds - or you are on romantic trip. Too many stops and pictures to take. Beautiful lake full of many birds and activities. ||November 2, 2016
Paulo C||50||If move to London someday I can't imagine live far way from this park. It's a great escape from the city noises, relax and play with the squirrels (yes there's a lot of them!). A place to run and do other kind of sports. There's also a real good restaurant in the middle of the park facing the river (The pizza is great for a resonable price). If you're in London you must cross the park at least once! ;) ||November 2, 2016
Zoe C||50||Visited London for Christmas with my partner, obviously, Winter Wonderland was on the itinerary!We visited Hyde Park and spent most of the time outside admiring the park itself before actually going in.Great day out!||November 2, 2016

Gerard A||40||Absolutely lovely for a stroll and with the lake, wildlife and many paths to walk, it feels like you're in the countryside....beautiful spot.||November 2, 2016
Gsy_Girl3||40||What a lovely place! We had a fantastic early morning walk here and spotting squirrels was definitely a highlight. Such a beautiful atmosphere in the autumn, crisp leaves and even crisper air meant that scarfs and boots were necessary, but it just added to the whole experience. ||November 2, 2016
CrowdedEarthKitchen||40||Walking through Hyde Park is picturesque, and seeing horses everywhere was fun. However, having to pay for a lounge chair - when benches are scarce and full - was uncool.||November 2, 2016
LondonGuest2016||40||Excellent place with a lot of gardens, eg Italian ang Kensington . . . ideal for walks, running and picnic with children lota of pets and berds. ||November 2, 2016

keesha_wpg||50||I was fortunate to be here on a wonderful sunny day. It was a spectacular visit!! I stayed in Kensington so was able to walk down. It was lovely to see the Serpentine structure, Prince Albert's awesome statue, the beautiful swans but the most amazing thing for me to see was the wonderful waterfall memorial site for Princess Diana. I sat by the water where children splashed and played. I just loved the atmosphere and the peace and tranquility. A must see in London!!||November 2, 2016
CaperGal||30||We specifically went to hyde park to visit an encampment, and weren't disappointed. We were hoping to visit Kensington Palace, but definitely underestimated the size of the park. It's nice enough, but there are other, prettier green spaces in London.||November 2, 2016
M H S||50||Everytime I visit London I also visit Hyde Park. This time is was so beautifull with the fall and all the colours on the trees. I have also been here in the springtime with lots of flowers - the summertime where people sunbade and enjoy a time out. January with lots of snow. Anytime of the year this park is one of my favourits!||November 1, 2016
adrienne5413||50||Loved Hyde Park. My sister and I took a very nice stroll in the early morning. I didn't know what to expect. It's much larger than I expected. We saw the Peter Pan statue. There's a lot we didn't see, so I look forward to spending more time there.||November 1, 2016
BusinessTravel1856||50||Very large park directly across the street from the JW Marriott Grosvenor hotel and other similar hotels once you find the right crossing site the park is a joy for a mind clearing walk.||November 1, 2016
Excursion802746||50||Beautiful, clean and peaceful park that is particularly resplendent in Autumn with beautiful leaves floating down everywhere. It's a calm oasis in the midst of a busy city. You can easily 'stray' into Kensington Palace or feed the fowl at the Serpentine pond or just sit and watch all manner of people (and dogs) passing by.||November 1, 2016
Michael B||50||Great place for walks. Lots of birds. My wife and I grabbed some snacks and sat on a bench and enjoyed the park. Just wish the weather was better, thats London for ya!||November 1, 2016

EnjoyCaliLife||50||Such a beautiful park on a sunny day. Enjoy walking or running along the paved paths. Enjoy a cappuccino at the snack stand near the pond as you watch the ducks and swans. It's a nice peaceful escape from the bustle of downtown London. ||November 1, 2016

BabsMiller||50||Went into park from Albert Gate and rented city bikes as there was a station right at that entrance. Pedaled all around the park and pond and ended up at Speaker's Corner as it was a Sunday. Great, lively park. I didn't hurt that it was a pretty, sunny fall day either. ||November 1, 2016
Vicki L||50||Brilliant, fun, exciting, mysterious, wildlife friendly. Their website really doesn't do it justice. ||November 1, 2016
Nadia R||50||Be prepared to walk!Enjoy a green oasis in the middle of London. Squirrels and pidgeons are everywhere. Interesting statues and easy to follow signs lead to some of the special attractions. Lot's of joggers and dogs, but the park is big enough for all. The bicyclists could be a little more corteous, but there are some paths that they aren't allowed on. Take money (50 pence) for potty breaks.||November 1, 2016
dooandherb||40||Nice park. Great for a stroll, a run, or just people watching.If in London, you really need to walk through here.||November 1, 2016
GeorgePJS||40||A lovely city park. Plenty of wildlife, landscaped well, and facilities such as a playground and the water features. Well worth a visit for a stroll outside city bustle. ||November 1, 2016
989nadinec||40||We were lucky enough to get a stunning sunny day in October for our trip to Hyde park. We rented the city bikes and rode around this gorgeous area. The leaves were colourful and added so much character. Definitely get to Hyde park when in London. It's very near Oxford street, Royal Albert Hall and many other sights too. ||November 1, 2016
Rubin51||50||Hyde Park is a great place to relax and walk around enjoying the traditions of London. Not necessarily for the "adventure seekers" but it is one pf those iconic places that deserve attention.||October 31, 2016
seasatin||40||The park is beautiful in Autumn and great to visit with toddlers as there a playground towards Knightsbridge. Make sure to have some bread to feed the ducks and pigeons at the Serpentine pond.||October 31, 2016
Mariliava||50||This is a great place to hang out on the weekend. Kids and pets will love it! Quite big park with some monuments. Cosmopolitan place. Please don't feed the pigeons, there are so many!||October 31, 2016

giffenk||30||The park is relatively flat and open with many straight paved paths, very few trees.Be prepared to be entertained by dogs running about as there does not seem to be a leash law.There are very few benches so ths is not a place to linger at...||October 30, 2016
polmiz||50||Huge park where you can just go for a relaxing walk or stop for coffee or a light snack next to the waters edge while watching swans and people passing by. Great atmosphere during the christmas season with Winter Wonderland. Might be a bit expensive to go on rides but worth a go. ||October 30, 2016
brentm946||50||In large cities like London,Paris, and New York, parks are often a welcome break from the congestion and noise. Hyde Park offered a welcome stroll through green spaces that were both beautiful and refreshing. There was a restaurant in the park where we stopped for a bite and it gave us great opportunity to enjoy our leisurely walk.||October 30, 2016
Lorna C||40||The autumn colours of the trees were magical. There is so much to see. Bikes to hire, cafe overlooking the lake. Princess Diana's Fountain (a bit disappointing). All the London Parks are valued green spaces in the city and are a total credit to the British love of gardens. ||October 30, 2016
csharrison||50||Leaving my husband back at the hotel, I went for my long anticipated 'historical' walk through Hyde Park and south. Before entering the park, I stopped at #7 Prince's Gate, to see the last home and death place of Clementine Churchill, then proceeded into the park at Kensington and Exhibition. Just up on the left are the Coalbrookdale Gates -the last surviving pieces of the Great Exhibtion in 1851 (Crystal Palace). Then onward to see The Serpentine and Lady Diana memorial fountain. Then into the park east past the Serpentine gallery and to the Albert Memorial - was stunned by its size and beauty. The Royal Albert Hall across the street south was just as impressive to see. Then down across Kensington Gore to # 28 Hyde Park Gate - the last London residence and the place of death of Winston Churchill. Interestingly, on the other side of the street and closer to Kensington was the home of Robert Badon-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts. A lovely one hour walk on a crisp fall morning to begin the day. ||October 30, 2016
Helen B||40||Hyde Park is a lovely park providing a bit of peace in the centre of the city. There are some pretty vistas with the various water features or statues.||October 30, 2016
K N||40||Beautiful natural park and clean walk ways with nice fellows walking their dog. Path by lake with espresso stand with the best latte we had in London. Perfect short cut to the Museum of Matural History and Exhibition streets food and other fun. ||October 30, 2016
Gints K||50||After crowded London streets this park is real gem in the heart of the London. And it is even more than park as there is quite a lot of animals and birds you can spot. My kid enjoyed squirrels, which were so brave, that you could even touch them and squirrels liked monkey nuts very much. And there were also lot of birds and many of them were very friendly and wanted to play - so much fun for kid. One advice - park is very big, so expect long walking and also better take with you some food or drinks, as there was no place to buy in autumn in park.||October 30, 2016
TKratky||50||I really like this place. It is great for walking, running or just having a chill. My last visit was in October, so I just walked around and had great coffee and cookie in very nice coffee shop next to the lake. Great time, superb view. ||October 30, 2016

Kiwicraig78||40||Hyde Park can be many things - a great place to attend a big rock concert, Winter Wonderland festivities at Xmas, or pleasant strolls through nature and by the water any of the seasons. Easily accessible from various tube lines, there are lots of little hidden treasures, from Kensington Gardens to an unusual fountain memorialising Princess Diana.There's a real sense of peace here, no matter how busy it is (well, unless you're packed in in front of the stage for a large concert). The kind of place you can visit again and again, regardless of time and mood. ||October 29, 2016
Canadiantraveller027||30||We walked a bit of Hyde Park after arriving in London to acclimatize to a new time zone. It is quite large. Great place for joggers. Not necessarily a lot of things to see for tourists, but that's ok if you want some walking time or to find some solitude.||October 29, 2016
mitchian||50||A great park, a must visit, walk the lanes, enjoy the green. This is a cool place in the middle of London, a must on your tour.||October 29, 2016

HelenC1627||40||We visited here as recommended on a blog of places to go in London with toddlers. The park itself is beautiful and so big but the main feature for us was Princess Diana's memorial playground. What a fab playground for the children. So much to see and do ||October 28, 2016
GarysTribe||50||Hyde park is an incredible park that has maintained its naturalness in the heart of London, that takes you away from all of the noise from the street and brings you back to nature.Walking through the park calms your mind and lets you breathe again, letting you escape for a moment, or a long one. The Pond is great with a great variety of birds that are super friendly taking food from your hands and not forgetting the overly friendly squirrels. RecommendationGo and visit and relax by a tree, forget the super fast paced city and let yourself enjoy a few moments of nature right on your doorstep.Walk from the West point of the park (Kens house) to the East point of the park (St James Park) then onto Westminster and Big Ben.||October 28, 2016
RAQL3||40||This park was in close proximity to the hotel. We visited while waiting for our room to be ready. Gardens were very pretty.||October 28, 2016
Michal_Kadlec||50||We've visited Hyde Park again - as we do everytime we visit London. London has a lot of parcs, but Hyde Park is the only one. With Serpentine lake and great Serpentine Bar&Kitchen restaurant on its shore. And, of course, with squirrels you can feed from hand... :-D||October 28, 2016
Haveadeal||40||Like to come here often just to have a stroll around, its a great 'people' watching place with lots to see and do, from the bizarre to the ridiculous, but fun.||October 28, 2016

144drewd||40||Spend a good two hours wandering around the park, saw lots of very friendly squirrels and even a parrot in the park.Lots to see and discover and it's great exercise without noticing! Really nice place to just lose a few hours and take it all in.||October 27, 2016

alevtinask||50||This park reminds me heaven when people and animals all live in peace. So many birds pay no attention to the boats with people on the lake. The park provides with lots of activities: horse riding, rollerblading, sunbathing. I really like the Diana's Memorial. And Speakers' Corner is something outstanding too.||October 27, 2016

BrownEyedGirl17||50||My friend and I love coming to the Proms in the Park, here. The concert is always amazing and as my friend is disabled, we take advantage of the facilities on offer for disabled people. The raised platform area is the perfect spot to get a great view of the stage. There is a separate entrance, so you are admitted very quickly and there are exclusive toilet facilities available next to the viewing platform. The staff are always friendly and very helpful. We love coming here!||October 26, 2016

andrewc533||50||This is just a relaxed, enjoyable park with plenty of gardens and of course the Serpentine. I love the plantings and rose gardens in spring/summer. Its popular on good days. Buy an ice-cream or coffee and enjoy a walk around.||October 26, 2016
waldorf53||50||One of the many London parks, a great park, huge and plenty of space to get lost in, even in London. A must on a sunny day.||October 26, 2016

Commodore99||50||Spent several hours strolling around the park. So, so pleasant. Views and venues all great. Attractions and facilities are varied and available. Loved it.||October 26, 2016
librarianbarb||50||Enjoyed the views, the wildlife and the history of the importance of the park in London. I can understand why the Queen loves it!||October 26, 2016
olihenryy||50||Had a good wander round Hyde Park yesterday. Its huge. Especially nice at this time of year when the huge trees are changing colour. Could easily spend ages wandering round.Sat outside the cafe right by the pond in the morning with a mate, was cold out but had a cup of tea and and was just relaxing watching the swans and ducks and taking it all in really. Bit of an oasis in the centre of London.||October 26, 2016
traveller111165||50||If you are a visitor to London, this is one place you cannot miss. More vibrant than Central Park in NYC, more inspiring than Lincoln Park in DC, Hyde Park has everything. Eccentrics go to Speaker's Corner, history buffs go to Wellington House, romantics go to Italian Gardens and nostalgics go to the Diana Fountain. Of course, if you just want to walk then all 600 acres are open to you. The Serpentine and Long Waters add that aquatic touch without which no great park is complete. As a Bertie Wooster fan, I personally love this place since I can relate to those wonderful scenes fro Wodehouse stories.||October 26, 2016
denniswI9447MS||50||Walk around the parks at London this was very busy but you can take your time and enjoy a coffee/tea/cake/ice cream and watch the day go by and blend in with the things that are going on.||October 26, 2016
RamonaT201991||40||Beautiful and tranquil retreat from London's chaotic vibes. A great place to spend a Sunday afternoon and just relax.||October 26, 2016
SabbyNahan||50||Great experience, peaceful and it has breath taking beautiful surroundings. You will enjoy your time there. Good for meet ups, picnics and long walks to just relax and enjoy the scenery ||October 26, 2016
Pier024||50||This park offers you all what you like: nice promenades, animals, water, playing grounds. And it's so close to the city!||October 26, 2016
johnclewes2016||50||What's not to like? A place to come in all seasons, and just breathe, relax, enjoy the ambience. You can't avoid it.||October 26, 2016
SaffanaS4||50||Its one of the most beautiful parks in the world without a doubt. The ponds and the birds with so many people walking their dogs and cycling. It feels like a totally different world ! Done miss this at all! It makes a lot of what London truly is.||October 26, 2016
FTMDave||50||This is an enormous park, with the Serpentine lake, a great way to escape the hustle & bustle of London.||October 26, 2016
weberwest||40||Very nice park with a huge lake inviting for boating pleasures and it even sports a horse riding track. The Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Founain, a fun water walk area for children is great for the warm summer days, our little 3-year old tyke could not get enough of wading in the shallow watery channels.||October 25, 2016
Travelcooking||50||The only way for you to exit out of the chaotic rhythm of London, it is to immerse yourself in this park located in the heart of the city; once you begin to enter into the park, you will naturally look around, observe the infinity of the green, the serpentine lake, the squirrels, and you will find yourself asking how it is that you're still in the heart of a big city like this one. But you can find all of this in Hyde Park, ideal for a run, a bike ride, a walk, a picnic, sunbathing, doing any kind of sports or just to relax a few minutes sitting on a bench. Tranquility is always a guarantee!||October 25, 2016
CoolDad66||50||What a great park to gently walk around. Loads to see, including the Diana, Princess of Wales fountain and the serpentine.||October 25, 2016
ASchlarb||50||A beautiful large green space with many birds such as magpies, pigeons, swans, herons, and even parakeets that are always near one particular tree. Dogs, squirrels, bees, fountains, a statue of Peter Pan and a water monument memorial to Princess Diana where the children romped in.||October 25, 2016
africadan1||50||What a great space. All season walks, dog wlaks kids playing, couples, picnics. Nice cafes and facilities. Can recommend||October 25, 2016
Pervin D||50||Walk, jog, unwind, read a book - many things you can do visiting the beautiful parks in London. With plenty of green space, lovely walking paths, places to relax and enjoy the tranquility of nature, Hyde Park is one of my favorites in London.||October 25, 2016
Jayne B||40||Hyde Park was very beautiful. We walked through it several times on our way to other things, but I would love to take a couple hours to sit there and enjoy the birds, the water, and just chilling. Especially with a glass of wine!||October 24, 2016
carrcecil||50||I really love this park.Parrots, same color the trees, green.Squirrels, swans, ducks, the guards on horses, you can run, cycling, drink at the bar...||October 24, 2016
Lydia C||50||We all thoroughly enjoyed walking through the park, saw lots of wildlife, and even saw a man (I'm assuming local/regular) feeding the squirrels and blue tits by hand. It was a shame because we had already made plans to have lunch in the hard rock, because if we had thought ahead more we would have enjoyed having a picnic in the park, and in fact we intend on doing this next time. There was lots of people enjoying the park, walking their dogs, relaxing, walking and taking photographs.||October 24, 2016
Cheryl K||50||I visted her back in July. We had a long walk through after visiting the Natural History Museum. We had a lovely picnic. Really is a beautifully kept park||October 24, 2016
nids2711||40||this garden was beautiful, you can see people jogging at any time of the day.. from morning 6 to afternoon 2 and then till evening.Ducks , Squirrels , pets are good attractiontowards the mid of the park is a beautiful pond.its a good stroll. loved it.||October 24, 2016
sgollasch||50||Always a relaxing time to see the park. At the end of teh Serpentine Lake is a nice fast food restaurant and coffee shop. The gift store on the lake is a tourist trap.||October 24, 2016
Ghooma||50||Today I saw a man feeding a Squirrel!You can not see this anywhere except here in the Hyde park where you basically walk and walk and walk ..||October 23, 2016

M272OTannem||40||Walked in Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens on a beautiful late September day. The only down side was that the Princess Diana memorial fountain wasn't open yet (starts at 10 am)||October 23, 2016
Nat G||50||Hyde park offers a different experience every time you visit. Visiting in the Autumn and spring are especially wonderful with the changes in all the flora and fauna. But don't feel like you're missing out in Winter, because it still holds it's charm, and Winter Wonderland held there every year is magical.I'd highly recommend hiring the Santander city bikes from one of the many stations around the park and taking a bike ride through. It's a great way to see a lot of it without having to spend entire days there. Just beware that not all paths are bike friendly, and you can get in a bit of trouble for not obeying signage. The princess Diana memorial fountain is a must-see.||October 23, 2016
malc1005||50||The park is ideal for long or short walks, having a picnic, feeding the wildlife, or just sitting and watching the rest of the world go by. Very tranquil and peaceful. Well worth a visit or two.||October 23, 2016
JayneeGeee||50||Whether it's sunny or not this is a great place to walk and people watch . At Christmas one end of the park is dedicated to the winter wonderland- a mixture of fairground rides , Christmas market stalls , bars, restaurants, ice rink, and shoes ,||October 23, 2016
1960MaryHelen||40||There is something for everyone in this Park, there is a boating lake, lots of places to have a coffee or just for a scroll. If you happen to be visiting at Christmas time the winter wonderland is on, it's fun to have a look around although be warned it gets really busy and if you stop for food or drinks it is very expensive.||October 23, 2016
Steven C||50||To take the steps where so many have been is quite a treat, The Serpentine is a serene body of water and is calming to walk around. A cafe where you can eat and drink from a good menu sits to the east (just on the edge) of the Serpentine. You can observe speakers corner and the bandstand, a relaxing venue and one of the many jewels within Londons Parks.||October 23, 2016
HypAtia07||50||For us, Hyde Park was the 2nd best thing that happened to us in our London visit! Our day began from the park (having a morning walk through the park with hot coffee in hand) and ended the same way. You can also rent a bike and enjoy this huge park anytime you want!||October 23, 2016
Felipe357||50||It was the first thing I did in London after my arrival, since my Hostel was very near the park. It is beautiful to walk there, just to relax and "do nothing". I wish my city had a place like this. Recommend to visit the Peter Pan statue, the Albert Memorial and others.||October 23, 2016
FloLyTeam||50||Beautiful park. One of the best ones I've been to. It's huge and green and perfect on a sunny day. A must-see in London!||October 23, 2016

188frankied||40||i have bee here for walks, festivals and picnics. it's very large . doesn't have the best views i think but it has many access points and is very popular for jogging . i don't really see any anti social behaviour there either. nice for evening strolls too. ||October 23, 2016
MichaelK10895||50||Hyde Park is a great Park and so big. You can do hours of wonderful walking, ride your bike and spend nice time riding around Hyde Park seeing many green grass, tree and lakes. In winter period from late November to early January Hyde Park has the best event for winter period is winter in wonderland it's so much fun with many theme park rides, ice skating ring and many fun fair stores... ||October 23, 2016
avbemmel||50||Hyde Park is a great place. It's a beautiful park, where you can relax and walk around. But you can also visit several places, like the Diane Memorial Fountain, Speakers Corner or the Kensington Palace.||October 23, 2016
AdamJK_82||40||Beautiful large park in the heart of london. Its a great place to walk through whether it be the large public lawns, the gardens or the lake. I have visited many times and would normally give it 5 stars however at the moment there is a large amount of high scale fencing lining the public lawns with works taking place inside. It detracts alot from the park at present.||October 23, 2016
Paradise809433||50||Feed the swans, take a picnic, kick a ball. This park is massive and very green and full of trees. You don't have to worry about losing sight of your friends family as this place is very spacious. ||October 22, 2016
Tanu K||50||Loved the sun there, kids loved feeding swans,performers were amazing.London cannot be complete without Hyde park.||October 22, 2016
T1063YYdavidk||40||This park is large, perhaps larger than central park in NYC. At the northeast corner they have a place for individual of any persuasion to get up on a soap box (or ladder) and expound to whomever is gathered there. This happens after noon on Sundays. I'm told the origin is that this is the spot where people were hanged, and whomever was being hanged got to spout off whatever was on his mind before being executed. Today they don't have executions anymore, but the various speakers are roundly heckled by those who gather to hear them. There are also lakes, swans, trees, paths, monuments, and etc. I think it would probably take over an hour to walk from one end to the other. Proving that London is a very "green" city.||October 22, 2016
RockyochZorro||50||This amazing park in the middle of London offers an uncountable number of paths to run around with seeing all the sights. One of my favourite city-park runs in the world....||October 22, 2016
Linda D||40||Hired the city bikes, lovely park, very clear cycle paths. Sat at the pond, ate lunch was a lovely afternoon.||October 22, 2016
Eli1952||40||Famous Hyde park , an amazing walking experience in the middle of London. We walked and walked and still have to comeback to finish it .||October 22, 2016
emrep65||50||This was the second time we have been at Hyde park. This time we had a walk through the park and take a cycle boat in the lake. You could have close connection with the ducks and swans. Few swans chased us in the cycle-boat whilst we were paddling. I feel Hyde park is a place one should see at least once in a life. If you leave nearby Hyde Park then try to make it as much as you can. Go there and enjoy the nature at the very heart of the London, worth it...||October 22, 2016
TaurusRising||40||My husband and I took a morning walk into Hyde Park. We stopped just before entering to see the Albert Memorial (much larger than I thought it would be!) and then followed the winding path into the park. It was beautiful and worth the time to visit. The swans and ducks near one of the bridges were serene to watch, and we were lucky enough to see one swan take off and "fly" over the water for a great distance. We also stopped and visited both branches of the Serpentine Art Gallery in the park on both sides of the bridge. It was a lovely morning experience and gave us peace before jumping into the rest of our more touristy day.||October 22, 2016
Bandit-One||50||This time in London we took a bit more time walking around Hyde Park. It was a really hot day and the streets of London not the best spot to be for our doggy in this heat.Hyde Park offered some nice green lawns, some breeze and shade for our doggy and us. We entered at Hyde Park, walking at and around The Serpentine (up to the Sackler Gallery), having some lunch between at the Serpentine Bar & Kitchen, which was pretty good (and packed).The lake itself was filled with probably all boats available, almost a traffic jam on water (at least later on the day), but nice to look at. Even though the Park was pretty busy that day, it never felt too crowded, since it's just so big. We really enjoyed our time here and it's always a nice change from the fun, but busy streets of London. Surely we'll be back.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile.||October 22, 2016
colindancer||50||Clean, serene and beautiful! A peaceful green zone in the heart of London. People watch all day!! Lots of cyclists, runners, personal trainers and dog walkers. Beautiful is the sun is out. ||October 21, 2016
kateld123||40||With the right weather this is a lovely place to be, Shame the great British weather let's us down most of the time. But definitely worth a stroll through this lovely park. ||October 21, 2016
Thomas T||40||It's the most accessible park in London and one of the biggest (if not the biggest) in Europe. It's got a table tennis area by the Marble Arch entrance and the speakers corner is entertaining. The Italian gardens corner is a utopia in the park. You're within a 3 mile radius of the most known attractions in London as well so it's a very ideal day out. Perfect for bike riding! Not the most beautiful park in London though when compared to Regent's Park and Richmond park. ||October 21, 2016
Happyhillwalker_11||30||Good open space with paths and well marked out , Little uninspiring compared to many of Londons big parks and not as well maintained . Great to walk through if you don't fancy the tube or fancy a take away and sit on the grass . ||October 21, 2016
anndemarco||50||Hyde Park in Autumn is incredible. The trees are a blaze of colour. When the sun comes out it's like a painting. There are so many birds and squirrels, dogs running around, it's a little piece of heaven for animal and nature lovers. Just walk around and enjoy||October 21, 2016

MustBe||50||What ever you come to London for, what ever you do in London and whenever you can, while in London, do yourself a favour and do not miss an opportunity to have a walk in Hyde Park.Within 10 minutes of beginning your walk you'll be overwhelmed by a real spirit, an almost tangible atmosphere of London's grandeur and yet most eloquently expressed by this wonderfully green and tranquil place of nature.Linger and allow London into your soul.||October 20, 2016
_peterdjohn48||10||I love hyde park.i have been there many times since the70s.but on my last few visits it has been impossible to find a public toilet that was open.i asked an hotdog vendor who worked near speakers corner if he knew of one and he told me the only one open was in macdonalds on the corner of oxford street.I was lost for words.come on London council ,,open some toilets.||October 20, 2016
Ducknzzz||50||Hyde Park is large, a great place to let the kids run off steam. Bring food for the birds and enjoy the life passing you by. Plenty of places to buy food and toilets. Changes with the seasons.||October 20, 2016

Lovely open spaces , with people sitting on grass, kids playing and plenty of wildlife.Had drink in cafe by serpentine as we watched people in boats on water.Felt very safe walking around and nice to have such lovely open space in heart of London. ||October 20, 2016
Fleurby12||40||With well signed and set out walking paths, cycle paths and places to throw down your picnic blanket Hyde Park is the perfect green space in London. For those that like to stroll and take a more laid back approach or just escape the hoards of tourists the parkland is quiet, with hidden lakes, fountains and statues. I can't wait to go back and ride through on a bike to really fully explore the park.||October 19, 2016
Cynthia M||50||but it's a wee touristy. still, it's full of history, and any green space in the city is welcome. yes. just go. ||October 19, 2016

HennaP124||50||Vast and a gigantic park with a lush green terrain. Great for evening walks , cycling , running or just a picnic too.||October 19, 2016
Janet F||40||I love walking around Hyde Park. There are so many activities to watch and things to see - children Bungy jumping, touch football and horses being ridden down Rotten Row. We had lunch outside the Serpentine Gallery, then went off to look at Kensington Palace gardens, where Princess Diana had lived. We had a pleasant afternoon tea at the cafe there. The gardens were lovely. Princess Diana Memorial fountain is south of the Serpentine Lake and east of the Serpentine Gallery. There are beautiful trees and large grassy areas to enjoy the outdoors right in the middle of London.||October 19, 2016
zdehaldevang||50||I walked through Hyde Park every day for 3 years. 6.30am cold winter walks were the best - no one else around, fresh and cold when all the ducks are waking up! Avoid 4pm for an hour or so, gets so hectic with all the the tourists. Get off the paths if you can, so many things worth exploring!||October 18, 2016
Tasro||50||I walked through Hyde Park on my way from Paddington Station to the Natural History Museum enjoying the water features and the large lagoon while watching all the different activities. People were jogging, entertaining theirchildren by feeding the ducks, having a picnic, watching the squirrels, exercising their dogs or just enjoying the lovely day as I was. In the afternoon I returned back through the park, entering near the Kensington Palace this landscape had large expanses of grass with tree lined walkways. I completed my walk at the Italian Gardens and enjoyed an ice cream and watched all the people using the Park. A lovely way to spend a few hours.||October 18, 2016
JeffBaltimore||50||nice place to spend time relaxing and again away from the hustle bustle and it is is free really good if you have childern||October 18, 2016

Even been skating along the promenade. In the winter they also do winter wonderland which is awesome!!! Enjoy. ||October 18, 2016
HalT672||40||I had a 9 months old in a baby carriages and needed him to sleep for a while. Very convenient to stroll around in the park for that matter. It was a Saturday and a bit crowded but you could find areas more quiet. Nice areas and lots of birds.||October 18, 2016

Danielle C||50||Rent a bike for a few hours and you'll get to see the entire park! Made a few stops along the way at the palace and for coffee. Also--the Winter Wonderland festival was so much fun!! Great place for a date on a cold day - or with your family. :)||October 18, 2016

megagarwal||40||The edges and borders of Hyde park is where the bulk of the crowd is. Hence it is very crowded and dirty. But if you venture deeper into the park, it is very beautiful. Not advisable when its cold.||October 18, 2016

lourg305||40||Hyde Park is gorgeous. Right in the middle of London, this enormous park is a great place to spend a lazy afternoon. There are bike paths, walking paths, paddle boats, playgrounds and picnic areas galore. We actually spent New Years Day, freezing our butts off walking around Hyde Park because everything else was closed. We still enjoyed it immensely, especially the Princess Diana Peter Pan Playground.||October 17, 2016

Kciff||40||The birds seem unaware of the hundreds of people standing around. They just fight over mates and nests and carry on as if no one was there. There are many types so maybe they feel more of a population pressure than humans being so close.||October 17, 2016

Jon M||50||Hyde Park is one of my favourite parks in London. The major paths are busy with pedestrians, cyclists, etc., but it's a large park and there's plenty of room to find a quiet spot. In particular, the Holocaust Memorial is a beautiful spot and is very peaceful, the Diana Memorial Fountain is beautiful and more crowded, and the walk around the Serpentine is busy with both people and birds.And, as a bonus, it's right next door to Kensington Gardens. I recommend a complete circuit of the Serpentine / Long Water, which will take you through both.||October 16, 2016

jsc6||50||Lots to see, especially on a crisp autumn day. Spend the day and walk around the entire park. You can even try renting a bike and bike around the park itself! The scenery is beautiful and lots of statues and birds to see. ||October 15, 2016
drumlohan||40||Great space in London, beautiful walks in the well kept park.lovely lake and gardens along with the attraction of speakers corner. Connects all the major London tourist experiences. Great for a few hours exercise is easy and people watching hinges. ||October 15, 2016
JimmyBikes||50||walkers, cyclists, dogs and horses. how can you ask for more than that. Diana memorial at the end is not to be missed, quite a place for introspection. Cyclists are generally very good at keeping to their bit. Wish the walkers were so thoughtful. And one tip don't stop your bike on the bike path to look around, move off. Love the geese/ducks, they almost landed on my head.||October 15, 2016
CapitanVictoria||40||Quite a vast park in downtown London...numerous walking trails and statues of prominent people, lovely lake..||October 15, 2016
BigAl_inCR||40||I love the park. I walk it almost every day I am in London and I never see the same thing. Great bird watching. Great people watching. Great dog watching. Great bunny watching. Super waterscapes, quiet contemplative spots. So much to see.||October 14, 2016
tollo652||40||This is a wonderful open air space in the middle of the city. A great place for the family of just to walk or run around and take in some fresh air..||October 14, 2016
FerneysMum||50||Hopping on a bus may seem quicker but actually it's not. Hyde Park is a great way to get across this part of London in a relaxed and happy feeling way. Always beautiful no matter what time of the year. Open spaces and easy routes. I often walk from Kensington to the West End using Kensington Park Gardens and then through Hyde Park. Sometimes I get a treat and see the Horse Guards or some other London scene. Love it. ||October 14, 2016
jasminashah||50||This park is huge, & it's located in centre part of city.Spending time over here is maybe 2 to 3 hours.According how much time u have in London.In this park you can see small pond with swam, that Is so beautiful,& relaxing as well nice photography can do.Either you can go with children or friends so you can chat with them with nice environment.||October 14, 2016
tutticutey||40||Walked from Lancaster Gate entrance past the Italian gardens and just a bit further down from there are lots and lots of exotic birds making a lot of noise and flying quite low! They're quite tame and will land on your hand if they think you might have food! On past Peter Pan statue which is a little underwhelming. Then on to the Albert memorial which is simply huge and I can't believe I've never seen it before considering I've been to the Albert hall a few times! Will be back soon for another stroll in another direction. ||October 13, 2016
Santin0D||40||The park is massive. There is a restaurant in the park which sits at the lake shore side. There is a bike boat rental so people can go across the lake. There is a bird sanctuary in the park as well as Peter Pan statue. The park is a very nice walk and connects to main streets and is close to Buckingham Palace.||October 13, 2016
DrCLG||50||Beautiful, well-maintained park with famous statues for pix. Lovely paths are easily traversed and the area around the pond/lake is paved. Several rather insistent swans and geese were adamant about getting fed, but we didn't have any food. Wooded and pleasant, wide paths.||October 13, 2016
Mana A||50||One of the biggest park in London , and you can enjoy in Sadie it and relax and play football and see the duck or birdies ||October 13, 2016
Jack B||50||Hyde Park truly has something for everyone - well groomed paths for those that want some exercise, either walking or running. The Serpentine Gallery, and a multitude of statues (Peter Pan, Still Water) for art lovers, There is an amazing amount of wildlife around the Serpentine Lake for nature lovers. Large grassy tree lined fields for kids to play. Marble Arch for the historically inclined, and Speaker's Corner for the politically inclined. And this is one of the few places where I saw dogs running freely and enjoying the day.You could easily spend an hour or a day here.Entrance is free.There are pay toilets located behind the cafe near the Italian Gardens.||October 13, 2016
shay2505||40||so quiet so serene, hectares and hectares of wildlife, different activities like boating cycling and the ducks are most pleasant. You can spend hours in this place and not even see a quarter of it - want to explore more of hyde park - lovely in autumn spring summer, have not yet tried winter! ||October 12, 2016
yjane22||50||We spent the afternoon exploring in glorious sunshine.It's well maintained and has lots of information points. Lovely to escape the city hustle and bustle.||October 12, 2016
Sabeltann||40||Was here with our 3 children. The park is big and good for running, but for the children feeding the squirrels with almonds was the the most amazing thing. The squirrels eat out of your hand if you move slow and stretch your hand out.||October 12, 2016
cyongyong||40||Good place for exercising and picnicking. Very well maintain. I enjoy the walk around the lake area.The public toilet is also well maintain.I got lost around the park cos is so so huge||October 12, 2016
Wildiris117||40||This is a lovely place to just stroll or sit and while away a few hours in busy London. There is an impressive variety of wildlife as well.||October 11, 2016

harteja||50||Nice park and special memories here as got engaged at the Winter Wonderlamd here last year. The Winter wonderland here every year is fantastic||October 11, 2016
GoncalvesJM||50||We stayed in walking distance to Hyde Park and it was a great escape from the busy city life. It is also nice as it is a main pick up for many of the bus tours. Enjoy walking around, soak up some sun if you can. Lots of fun and historical statues. Peter Pan was my favorite! Nice little cafe near the street side. We got some coffee and ice cream which was perfect.||October 11, 2016
Allison P||50||Hyde Park is a favorite place to visit in London, but this was my first time visiting in the summer months. There are chairs available to "rent," or bringing a blanket and spending a few hours laying on the grass is a lovely way to enjoy this space. It's quite large, so walking straight through or popping in and out as you walk around the surrounding area is a fun way to see different parts of the park.||October 11, 2016
AaA315||50||It's is a must visit. Nice walks and great views. You can ride bicycles , walk and jog. There are some good cafes. You can rent a boat. ||October 10, 2016
Steve Y||50||Walk this magnificent park, rest by the Serpentine, say Hi to Peter Pan, have a cuppa and scone at the cafe,great way to spend a quiet morning.||October 10, 2016
Mrshallam79||50||We hired a deckchair (£1.60) after shopping and sightseeing. It was good to sit outside and let the kids play near them ducks. ||October 10, 2016
Nicolo' C||50||Very nice, I visited it in October, it was cold but I stayed, it was worth the visit... you can even see Squirrels!||October 10, 2016
L0ve2TravelCanada||40||All parks are nice. In my opinion, anywhere with ponds, plants, trees, etc. is worth a visit if time permits. Parks are best experienced by locals and tourists not always get the chance to experience them, specifically big ones like this, to the full extent. We didn't spend that much time here and I am sure there were a lot to enjoy and see that we missed out on. I guess one can spend a whole day here. It all depends on the purpose of your trip.||October 9, 2016
Dharay_A||50||Walked through Hyde Park on our way to visit Buckingham Palace. Clean environment and lawns. My kids were thrilled to see the swans and ducks. Smells a bit though when you are close to the water. sat here and had nice ice cream sold at the park.||October 9, 2016
taniar647||50||Hyde Park is a park in the middle of London. Full of squirrels and people practicing yoga and jogging.It's worth walking it all from one side to the other! Try to enjoy of a picnic at the park for breakfast or lunch||October 9, 2016
AskVlad||50||How could you visit London and not go to Hyde Park? Take a stroll through, have a picnic. I would recommend going on a bike tour that way you can see more of the park and have some good commentary as well.||October 9, 2016
ross d||40||Attended British Summer Time at Hyde Park in July to see Take That and have to say great location very central London. Plenty transport links to and from.||October 9, 2016
MarkB10965||40||Walked through hyde park in order to get to our hotel when we arrived at victoria coach station. The park is absolutely huge and well kept. Found it strange for such a big park to be in the middle of London!||October 9, 2016
celticq2015||40||This is a fabulous open space in central London; lots of interesting statues to view, water with wildlife, an enjoyable walk away from the busy streets.||October 9, 2016
Marty F||50||Hyde Park is huge and diverse. Excellent walk through gardens, bridges, fountains, and green spaces!||October 9, 2016
earthandmoon62||50||Lovely to walk through this park and spend some time here relaxing on the grass. Nice space in such a busy place. ||October 9, 2016
west0z||40||Hyde Park is beautiful. You will walk for miles and never be bored. When you're too tired to go on, take a seat by the lake and order yourself a Pimms. A wonderful day out.||October 8, 2016
chriswC1951IZ||30||Been here a few times at different times of year. It's great when there are events on but apart from that it's a pretty average park.In my eyes it doesn't compare to Central Park or my local. It is vast which is great considering it's in a capital city but it just doesn't do it for me.||October 8, 2016
CherylGlendaleAZ||50||We had a long layover in London so took the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station. What a great 3 hours (you'll need 7 hours total though to do this - customs, travel time which is only 15 min. each way and enough time to get back to the airport and go through security). After lunch we walked over to the Park. It was full of people walking around and there is a great little outdoor coffee spot overlooking flowers, a lake, etc. Just great for people watching. I would have loved more time at the park just to wonder around.||October 8, 2016
Miss Wallace W||50||This has to be my favorite park in the whole of london! It is a huge expanse of green with huge ancient oak trees and shrubs and little boarders of exotic flowers and palms. The park is so huge that even if there are crowded areas, I am certain you can still find a quite place to sit and have a picnic. Many a time have we walked through the park both in the summer and at winter. Winter for me is the best! It's cold yet the park is alive with wildlife. The squirrels are super friendly and if you just happen to have some monkey nuts in your bag they will come right up to you and take them from your hands. The birds also! You can either walk by the lake and feed the ducks, swans and geese or rent a paddle boat for an hour, well worth it in the summer but be careful of the queue. ||October 8, 2016
Anshumanafsa||50||We stayed at the Kensington Hotel right next to this park with its serpentine lake and swans. It was a great summer in London....Weather and food being just like home in darjeeling ( soggy and boiled). Loved the corner where anyone can talk about whatever is on their mind. Also there is a crazy club of Englishmen who swim in the Serpentine.||October 7, 2016
gfsc5||50||This large park abuts Kensington Gardens and forms a large green oasis in London. Always lots of people there but because of its size this isn't a problem. Check out some of the gardens but net of the main areas is the Serpentine waterway. Boats, swans, ducks.Also look out for squirrels and a number of eating places.A nice spot to be on a sunny day.||October 7, 2016
L2433TSchrisa||50||Get away from the traffic and walk through the park and people watch.Watch out for the bikes though!||October 7, 2016
mytraveldairies||50||Its one of the best places for enjoying a sunny day in London. Kids would love it here. Pack your lunch and get there. ||October 7, 2016
CSI-Reviewer||40||There are a great many sections to this large park. Like many English parks, you'll find sculpture, gardens, walking paths, memorials, and ponds.||October 6, 2016
Laila X||50||Very relaxing and a great place to make a picnic and ride a bike. Totally safe, there are many police officers in case you need.||October 6, 2016
1330Breeze||30||It was nice, I like speakers corner . It was interesting to see people on their soap box expressing themselves and seeing different groups gather around them and challenge their ideas. ||October 6, 2016
R8396BZgaryh||40||Popped in here for a glass of wine and a rest from walking. its a great location. You would not believe that you were in the centre of London. ||October 6, 2016
dofkasss||50||Another great place in London that you must see. If you are going to England go to the Hydes park!!!||October 6, 2016
S u s a n R||50||Squirrels! So cute. The Diana Memorial needs some serious maintenance work. It's not running to its full capacity. Which is a pity, given the number of people who were there to see it. ||October 5, 2016
aljo_ao670||40||This is one of the biggest and more beautiful parks that London has to offer. It is perfect for everybody. It is good just for walking, its also a good picnic spot.||October 5, 2016
mmckdav||40||Hyde park is a wonderful little park in London. It's beautifully maintained, quite safe, and easilly accessed. I enjoy going for jogs through the park (and the adjacent Kensington Gardens). Plenty of open space to sit down and relax.||October 5, 2016
AleksandraK1424||50||You should steale an hour or two from your visit, if the day is sunny, to stroll in the Hyde Park. Just walk around, have a coffee or tea near the like. You will certainly enjoy it||October 5, 2016
KJT-AJT||50||We walked round Hyde Park on a lovely sunny Sunday morning, admiring the gardens, the lake and wildlife finishing with lunch at the Serpentine cafe which was delicious.||October 5, 2016
antkalis||50||Really great to have time to get away from work for a weekend and no place more relaxing then Hyde Park to while away the time. ||October 5, 2016
Ardo89||40||This, just like the other big parks in London is a wonderful place to have a walk and enjoy the sights, escaping the bustling city even if for half an hour. It will be great for your health and morale. ||October 5, 2016
stendek||40||It's amazing and almost unbelievable to think that lying on the lawn in the middle of Hyde Park you can hear nothing. Only the panting of the incidental jogger or the hissing of a tree swaying its leaves because of the wind are the possible sounds to be heard. Well yes, the occasional ambulance siren some hundreds of metres away; but that's all.||October 5, 2016
rhiannonl640||50||Came here to kill time while waiting for Harrods to open on a Sunday. It was busier than I thought it would be with joggers and dog walkers everywhere. We went to do a spot of Pokemon hunting, although there weren't any rare ones. It was a nice walk even though it wasn't a very sunny day. There is a cafe in the middle for people, however we didn't go in, it looked very busy for 11ish o'clock.I imagine on a sunny day with a picnic this would be very nice. It wasn't at all intimidating or enclosed which is nice for people who worry about being in a park on their own. (Some parks in Southampton you wouldn't go in on your own!)||October 5, 2016
Anastasios A||50||A very nice escape in the centre of London, very beautiful, a must see, especially in a sunny day. Ideal to relax after your shopping in the big shopping centres located a couple of underground stations away.||October 4, 2016
anjaliprabhu||40||Located very centrally in London, this is a beautiful park to have a picnic or just walk around. Definitely worth a visit.||October 4, 2016
anagabriela2015||50||This is one of my favorite places in London! It's great for everything you wish: romantic walks, picnics, watching the sunset while sipping a cup of coffee, exercises and etc.There is also the Winter Wonderland attraction, which is lovely and really fun!||October 4, 2016
Joanne C||50||Hyde Park comes to life on Sundays and if the weather is good it's a must visit place to sit around and watch the people and eat a sandwich.||October 4, 2016
Victoria R||50||Been to London loads of time but decided to make an effort to go see Hyde Park this time and it was definitely worth it. Had a lovely afternoon stroll through the park.||October 4, 2016
TICoachTodd||50||Outstanding and beautiful park. Extremely large as well. You don't feel crowded by people walking around as it is really spread out. Walked the whole park including by the Lido to see the swimming. Tons of people out on foot paddle boats and the birds were stunning to watch.||October 4, 2016
Diana002||50||I have been coming here for over 40 years, it wonderful lots going on. Lovely for a walk or games with the children, take a picnic if the weather ok. its free! to get in.Hire a a small rowing boat see the swans and ducks.||October 4, 2016
VinitPanpaliya||40||Large parks with very good connectivity to reach up to using Tube. It was nice experience relaxing in under the trees and watching the birds by the side of pond. But take the stock of food and water along with you as there is not much scope of getting anything around. ||October 4, 2016
Bunyarin C||50||well relaxing place. can be spend whole day at Hyde park if you have more time. There are a lot things can do and see there.||October 3, 2016
BertrandD246||50||What a lovely place to finish my stay in London. On a sunny and hot sunday, I have walked over one hour and i'll be back for sure.||October 3, 2016
VeniVidiViaje||40||Sunday stroll from Marble Arch to Kensington. Very pleasant surroundings with surprising little noise from nearby traffic. Highlight of visit was watching Mayfair butlers, coat tails flying, trying to run with lapdogs! Very Monty Python!||October 3, 2016
DoctorPonce||40||We happened upon the north and west side of the park as we walked from Notting Hill back to Mayfair. We were surprised at the start difference from one side of Hyde to the other. There were tall grasses and a dog park area on the west, while the east was used by hoards of people picnicking or laying about in the park. It was a beautiful area to walk through.||October 3, 2016
Matthias F||50||huge and nice , a green oasis which males London (among other things) so special ... you can even swim there (seasonally) ... take your time to explore this wonderful park ... but avoid when dark ...||October 3, 2016
John M||50||When you visit London, visit the parks they are free to roam. So much to see and it is a vast park, so beautiful and peaceful.||October 3, 2016
Betty S||30||A little disappointed with the maintenance of the park. Maybe my expectations were too high. A lot of the areas were overgrown and untidy. But all the same we did enjoy the area - there was plenty of seating throughout - but don't get stranded in an area where you have a fair hike to the toilets. Would definitely spend time here again.||October 3, 2016
StacyMacDonald||40||Every time we travel to London, we take in the many parks. Hyde is a wonderful place to wander and, for a time, forget that you're in the middle of a very busy city. Don't expect to walk every pathway unless you're dedicating a number of days solely to Hyde Park. And be sure to take in the Diana Memorial Fountain, which is so peaceful and has an incredible design. We'll be sure to return again and again. ||October 2, 2016
c0linchen||50||Great place to bring kids on the weekends. Suggestion, bring A LOT of bread with you, and have fun. It's also very friendly for runners, a reasonable amount of tracks.||October 2, 2016
pdv227||50||It feels like you are walking through one of the best parks in the world. Lots of birds. Very serene. Lots of joggers and tourists but it's so big that it's easy to escape them. I would recommend taking a stroll through Hyde Park if you had more than a day in London.||October 2, 2016
rachael313||40||Beautiful park for long walks, runs, cycles and feeding ducks and swans. A beautiful view sitting on park benches in the peace and quiet relaxing watching the world go by.||October 2, 2016
Gabsini||50||I love Hyde Park - there are so many things to do - you can take bikes, take a boat, walk, feed the birds (in theory I think you are not allowed to), see parrots, visit Kensington palace, several galleries, coffee shops, do horse riding (this should be booked in advance though).||October 2, 2016
RaviM1184||50||Amazing walk on a summer day was a weekend and surprisingly not crowded it was green and sunny what better day to take a long walk in Hyde park so much history to it ||October 2, 2016
Mujahid_Dhaif||40||a huge park , you can walk and have fun entery is free the closest underground station is Marble arch on sunday there is a free pubic speech corner where people gather and talk whatever they wanna talk about free boats available to paddle and there are a couple of restaurants to eat from the public bathrooms in the park costs 20pences so have some change with you ||October 2, 2016
Giulaiaiai||50||I love going for a walk in a sunny Sunday. Is the perfect way to escape the crowd of the city and enjoy a bit of peace and rest from the busy and crazy working schedule (and to plays with the squirrels). ||October 2, 2016
marie19512013||50||During my visit there was "Serpentine Swim Event" as part of London marathon.Good place to relax on the lawn, have a cup of coffee, watch birds.||October 2, 2016
Cat4Me||50||A stroll through the Park is a must. Visit the Rose Garden, which was still full of colour, see the many birds on the water. You wouldn't think you were in London.||October 2, 2016
Khin Q||40||Hyde Park is a pleasant place for a walk and if you stay in Kensington, you can use the park as a short cut to walk to Bayswater, where there are good Chinese restaurants, and to Marble Arch, which is good for shopping.||October 2, 2016
Misslouboutin19||50||Hyde park on a nice day is beautiful. Lots of people just sitting on the grass having lunch, chilling out and watching the world go by. Sometimes the proms stage is there and you can hear them practising truly wonderful. Hyde park winter wonderland is a must makes u feel all Christmassy and lots of different attractions. ||October 2, 2016
MikeArran||40||Wandering the 350 acres of central London that is Hyde Park it's difficult to believe that Oxford Street, Park Lane and elegant districts like Mayfair are only moments away.When Henry VIII siezed this land from the nearby monks of Westminster it was to extend his hunting opportunities. He wouldn't recognise it now! It's existed in its current layout for close on 200 years and, on a fine day, is a great place to spend time.Chock full of fountains, monuments, open water, this is a place that commemorates so much of contemporary British history. From two world wars through to the life of Princess Diana and the London Bombing, it's all here. There are lovely walks, a fabulous rose garden and places to rest, eat and drink.You can scrape along the perimeter in an hour but to do the 350 acres justice you need at least half a day.||October 2, 2016
littlest-elephant||50||Such a beautiful park for a walk or picnic. You can get food here and rent boats as well. Always very beautiful. ||October 2, 2016
Famous_Troubadour||50||This park may be in Central London but because of its size you can easily think it is in the middle of the country side. Well worth a visit to walk or cycle through.||October 2, 2016
steelered42||50||A very nice park. Good breakfast place inside the park. Spend a few hours. The Diana tribute is very nice. Overall one of the best parks centrally located within a city.||October 1, 2016
michellegP511VS||50||A beautiful place for a day of relaxing. Reminded us of Central Park. I wish we would have gotten some bikes for the day though. ||October 1, 2016
Martine W||50||This park has something for everyone. Cafes, boating lakes, horse riding, area for picnics, lovely walks and plenty of parking.||October 1, 2016
WightStripe||50||Nicely kept park, very clean and plenty to wander round and look at. Great way to spend an hour or two.||October 1, 2016
thomasinceh||50||This is the best greenspace in central London kind of reminds you of central park in New York, the park is wide and big with a lot of awesome British traditions and water ponds. we saw a few horse carriages going about the park with carriages and that was truly magnificent. I loved also the water pond with the swans swimming around and I highly recommend you visit this park while in London.l||October 1, 2016
DWR25||50||Hyde Park is so wonderfully relaxing! Take in the garden artistry, beautiful ponds, dine at one of the many outdoor restaurants, and just unwind. So worth the visit! ||September 30, 2016
Lolade D||50||hyde park is such a beautiful place with a lot of activites especially during summer.my daughter really liked the serpentine area with all the ducks on the waterfront.nice family outing day.the fountain at the princess diana memorial area was also nice.||September 30, 2016
548angelah||40||Visited for an organized salsa work out, and found the park to be quite quiet on a Tuesday morning. The organiser was expecting in excess of 500 people, there was hardly a hundred people, but had loads of fun.....||September 30, 2016
dimitrinabokov||50||Lovely to walk around despite the cold weather. within meters from our hotel and next to busy oxford street , it was an oasis!||September 30, 2016
veganbyeden||50||Hyde Park is a beautiful spot in London. I expected to go for a short stroll and ended up spending hours there feeding the animals. I went on one of the pedal boats and fed as many ducks and swans as I could. Then I went around feeding the squirrels - they are SO friendly, they will approach you and eat right out of your hand. I went around trying to find more nuts to give to them because they are so adorable. Beautiful park and I recommend visiting - have your nuts ready!||September 29, 2016
Pek N||50||Return to London after 8 years and it was great to go round again. Very pleasant and enjoyable trip together with family. Really have a great time !||September 29, 2016
JH72||50||Unlike some other London parks Hyde Park is nice and flat. You will see people jogging and roller blading around from early morning until late in the evening. A lovely opened spaced park .....just what you need after the madness of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street shopping. ||September 29, 2016
majo959||40||As a jogger I'm always looking for good places to run around. Hyde park is perfect for doing this and you won't be the only one running. A run around the lake is beautiful and will bring you to the Italian fountains. On your way you will find an outdoor swimming pool on the west Side of the lake. So if you don't like to run, go for a swim. I think it's free. If you don't like running or swimming, just walk around. It's worth it.||September 29, 2016
Steve V||40||If you're staying near Paddington Station and would like to visit the Science or Natural History Museums you can take a nice stroll across Hyde Park to get to them. Along the way you can stop at the Diana memorial near the bridge across the lake.Very pleasant.||September 29, 2016
charoos||50||Hyde Park is favourite of tourists, situated near Marble Arch and Oxford Street, it is ideal for leisurely strolls and enjoy a number of statutes in the park. Historically the Park hosts all kind of political rallies.||September 29, 2016
MonicafromMiami||50||When traveling these days with all the new added stressors; finding a way to take a break, relax, and rejuvenate that is free and easily accessible is a real treat. This park is large and expansive to where you don't feel the crowds, and yet there are enough people around so you feel safe walking alone. Great way to acclimate from jet lag if hotel room is not yet available.||September 29, 2016
475malekm||40||Be prepared to spend the day in the park. so much to see and do or just relax. Just wonderful Recommended to visit place/||September 28, 2016
AbdullahAltamimi||50||It is an amazing huge park. Walking around it give peace and make you relaxed. Run, bike or just walk you'll enjoy it no doubt.||September 28, 2016
Brindyz||50||My second visit to Hyde Park......never fails to impress. We had a lovely wander for a couple of hours, past lakes, stopping for icecream cones (YUM) long avenues of tall tall trees and beautiful garden beds...the roses were gorgeous. The horse riding paths are a treat to see for urban people....just delightful. Squirrels another treat too!||September 28, 2016
Melinda C||50||Hyde Park is beautiful, it has lots to offer, whether swimming in the serpentine or rowing. Deckchairs are available for just a unite sit down, There are two really good art galleries in the park, usually with free exhibitions, ther are the Sedpentine gallery and the Sackville. The Sackville has a restuarant designed by called The Magazine, a futuristic building designed by Zaha Hadid, good for coffee and cake but not for a main meal. ||September 28, 2016

zayoonaa||50||Hyde park is always busy.. It's big but there's always people there.. It's so beautiful you won't get fed up of it even if you go everyday for a walk\jog. It's bigger than regents park and certainly busier. ||September 28, 2016
615lilav||40||Hyde Park is a refreshing oasis in the busy London. It is so nice to walk to and from the office by the park. The reason I gave only four points was that the lawn has been only partly mowed and that gives unkempt appearance. ||September 28, 2016
BackPacker671850||50||If you happen to experience a sunny day in London- Run quickly to the park! I took a vegan soup and sandwich at pret a manger, and enjoyed a super lunch! Don't miss the absolutely beautiful serpentine museum in the middle of the park!||September 28, 2016
Cheng O||30||Park is excellent for relaxation and exercise, safe I supposed. However, I hardly see nor found a public toilet until I came to the lake cafe. Not happy at all. ||September 28, 2016
TravelSuitsMe||50||For accommodations - Various hotels overlook Hyde Park. It's a great place for long walks, bicycle rides, jogging or a picnic. Get the park schedule to see if there are concerts when you are in town.||September 28, 2016
luthien1981||50||We love to take a route through this park whenever we want to avoid traffic and just walk to our destination. This works best if it is not too windy; in rainy weather take your umbrella and macintosh with wellies and you're fine.Our routes are especially to/from Knightsbridge / Royal Albert Hall in direction of Marylebone and Wellington Arch or Mayfair / Park Lane.Anytime a great place for a stroll and enjoying being outside. Suitable for all ages and even people with walking disability (many options to sit down or - if you need to - go by wheelchair). Dogs to be kept on leash, children should be supervised near the water.||September 28, 2016

Katie2690||50||Hyde Park is a huge park in the middle of London which is a wonderful location for picnics, walks, games etc with the family on a sunny day. Hyde Park is also host to many musical gigs and festivals, making it well worth a visit.||September 27, 2016

L84WK||50||Easy to find and great spot to run. Trails, pathways, gardens and a lot of activity! Head out for a run or a walk and you will be amazed by the lakes and gardens everywhere. Designated areas for bicycles and pedestrians which makes 'wandering' by foot a little easier. Highly recommend a visit to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens!||September 27, 2016
Torterry C||50||I love the park, it so full of green and fresh air. this is great place just sit down and catch up with someone or just come for jogging after work. There were many locals around, sure, also tourist. You can meet up many interesting people here. Inside the park got three lakes, the long water, the Serpentime and round pound. Near the Serpentime, it got a really nice bar for people who like to have something to eat or drink. I saw many people also rent a little boat having some lovely time there. I didn't asked how much that cost though, just wanted to have a walk. We also saw the Hyde Park Bandstand, I saw it on the TV, sometime there will got some people perform music there. There was a summer music concert, when we were there. The area was block by the ticket area. ||September 27, 2016
LifeAt60s||40||It is a must to visit. It is a huge park with lots of wonderful birds living there. The setting is relaxing and it is easy to walk.||September 27, 2016

Hyde park is great for any situation, running, picnics, filmmaking, school activities, sports, photography, people watching, walking, with friends, family, children, pets, it is accessible to all!! You never know what you'll experience Here. It's worth every minute, that I can tell you for sure. Not to forget, what surrounds Hyde Park. You'll never get bored, there are tons of things to do and places to see. ||September 26, 2016
Denise S||50||Don't underestimate the park, as just a big open green space - treat it like any other tourist attraction in London, and give it some time on your itinerary! Loved the Princess Of Wales Memorial Fountain, and the Italian Gardens!||September 26, 2016
SA_Qatar||50||Hydepark, is one of the main places in London, that almost everybody in the world knows about! A morning walk or an afternoon walk with the kids it is never a disappointment.||September 26, 2016

rcooper86||40||Been to Hyde Park several times during different seasons. Its a must see if you are visiting London. Its a beautifully done big park with plenty of resting points and cafes etc to relax and watch the world pass by. In the right season i recommend popping in to see the rose garden, the colours are amazing. Also if you plan well there are various events that take place in the park, concerts etc. My only concern was in some parts of the park the toilets were in bad condition (considering you pay 50p) and in one case the mens was closed. ||September 25, 2016
Kinosao||50||I went there primarily to see the Bomber Command memorial and spent a few hours walking the many paths and enjoyed a perfect day. Many places to pause to sit and relax. Wandered into the Canada Memorial and found it to be stunning and great tribute to the men and women of Canada who contributed and sacrificed for the war effort. Right behind Buckingham Palace so you can enjoy it after the changing of the guard. ||September 25, 2016
Dean B||50||If you have to visit any park in the UK it has to be this one.In the heart of London and surrounded by great shopping from Harrods to Notting hill and Knightsbridge to Oxford Street.With lakes, gardens, monuments and loads of green open space with Kensington palace you could easily spend all day there.Easy access to the underground from all around the park.||September 25, 2016
JJM_2008||50||Went to Hyde Park in the summer holidays with my son and another family - We had a great day, we went on the boats and the kids had a great time in the water area, where they got absolutely soaked. However be aware of the cafe near the boats, they tried to short change my son, lucky he checks his change. ||September 25, 2016
111neila||50||Now I know why people like living in London, We were in Hyde Park on the Sunday morning taking the long way around to the Festival in a Day (Radio 2) and saw people walking dogs of all shapes and sizes, runners, walkers, roller skaters, exercising, people talking on benches or in groups. Planes flew overhead every 5 mins or so heading for Heathrow and the sun was out, shining and hot for September. We were heading for the Princess Diana memorial and although my back was hurting and I was a little hungover from the Proms (the previous day), this is worth visiting.It is a well designed piece of art, where people can paddle about a bit and almost seems to defy gravity when you look at it. We passed cafes on the way to the memorial and after the memorial there is the Serpentine where you can go out on the water on a pedlo, or sit in a deckchair. There is also a swimming pool here but we didn't actually see it.You can spend all day here and not be bored. We only had a couple of hours and managed to run up nearly 10000 paces on our fitbits.||September 25, 2016
patricia1922016||50||I booked a buggy tour of the park which meant I could see much more of its many highlights than if I had tried to walk around.||September 25, 2016

MrMadMagpie||40||This is quite a large park and as all parks are it is a nice opportunity to walk and chill out, sit and have a coffee near the Serpentine etc. It has the Albert Memorial, Princess Diana Memorial Fountain and the Italian Gardens all of which are excellent but it is otherwise comparatively featureless and other cities such as Madrid and New York have better parks.||September 24, 2016
roseannecuschieri||50||This is one of London's well known parks and it will always be one of my favorite places. Love to go there to relax there each time I visit London.||September 24, 2016
Vicki1359||50||Always enjoy walking around park. Often use it as a short cut from Bayswater/Lancaster gate side to Royal Albert Hall. Somehow you get a wonderful feel for this city by just wondering through park, working out by going for a run, cycle. Speakers corner a must see, iconic of London.

Alfred L||50||Hyde Park is great for walking, cycling, doing exercises with the 'Happy Bootcamps' organisation. The Bootcamps are hard work but extremely motivating and rewarding.

sofieshaz||50||I live right next to Hyde Park, closer to Kensington Palace - this place is huge! It's great for a roam around especially by the Serpentine. On a good day, grab a paddle boat with your friends: £12 for 1 hour or £10 for 30 minutes. Might as well pay the extra GBP2 for the extra 30 minutes! Prices are different for kids.There's nice little cafe at the end of the Serpentine that serves pizza, sandwiches and some other hot food and coffee. They've another cafe as well - so you definitely won't get hungry.Explore the park - Serpentine, Round Pond, Kensington Palace and Gardens. It's huge, you won't get bored and you'll definitely enjoy your time there.||September 22, 2016
Lena M||50||Absolutely love Hyde Park. Unexpected peaceful oasis just few meters from busy London's street. Especially absolutely adorable rose gardens- you can sit there for hours just enjoying the view and atmosphere. Very good place for romantic walks along the lake.||September 22, 2016

KD7152||50||This is the second year we have attended. Some amazing live acts and a chance to mingle with some real characters, This is a very British affair. Take a picnic, chairs, British scarf or flag, drink in plastic or cans (check the rules) and an umbrella. Something warm for when the sun goes down. A fun, different evening out, be prepared to chat, you might be someone interesting!||September 21, 2016
DebbieTeale||50||Put your walking shoes on and be prepared to spend ours walking the many paths, visiting the galleries and restaurants along the way. There are plenty of activities whether you are there for some quiet time in the gardens or want to roller blade or ride horses. I loved the stunning architecture and monuments also. ||September 21, 2016
glitrberi||50||I particularity enjoyed the roses that were displayed around the park. And the Serpentine is a highlight.||September 21, 2016

summitsurvivor||50||We strolled through the park on an unusually hot May Saturday, when it seemed like most of London had the same idea. It was busy, but not so much that we couldn't enjoy the gardens, views, and especially the Princess Diana Fountain area. We had no children with us, but mused how our two year old grandson would have loved splashing in the interactive fountain. Many children were in bathing suits, having planned this destination, but just as many were stripped down to undies, or went in fully clothed, and all were thoroughly enjoying themselves. The fountain is a large oval shape, situated on a slope, with gentle rivers of water not more than 6-8 inches deep at the most running down both sides. My husband even kicked off his shoes and socks, rolled up his pant legs and joined in the fun. A great place for the kids to enjoy.... and adults, too.||September 20, 2016
Mario D||50||A light shower was the right amount of rain to enjoy this part of the Park with a tru English flavour||September 20, 2016
Debbie L||40||We made this the meeting place for friends coming from Swtizerland for the weekend as it is so close to everything. We hopped off the tube at Notting Hill station and had a lovely walk through the Park to meet our friends for lunch at the Serpentine Cafe. They had a short walk from their Hotel near Marble Arch. There is so much to see you could spend a whole day there: art galleries, playgrounds, Diana's memorial fountain, Kensington Palace; several places to rest and eat and even paddle boats on the lake. The only downer was the rubbish...people who use London Parks in general, are litterbugs... it is sadly true. But don't let that stop you visiting...just make sure you put your rubbish in the bin :)||September 20, 2016
María Virginia P||50||Nice to visit,peaceful, beautiful. You should g. Nice animals, plants, flowers, calm. Interesting. Nature||September 20, 2016
Cleaneatingkelly||50||Took a stroll around Hyde Park on Valentine’s Day and it was calm, peaceful and romantic. So lovely to see so many other people out and about enjoying themselves away from the hustle and bustle of the ordinary city life in London.All of the grounds are extremely well looked after, so I believe this is a park which would be stunning all year around.||September 20, 2016
IvanaD1091||40||Good for rest, picnic, lunch, reset your head from work. Generally quite crowded but still nice. Also good for running, meeting and time with family.||September 20, 2016

laurak83f1||50||Can't believe I hadn't been to Hyde park before now!!!! Had a fab day sightseeing around London but Hyde park with the serpentine and Diana memorial fountain were definitely the highlight. Watch out for the rollerblade lessons though!! And make sure u have comfortable shoes on!!! The deck chairs to hire by the hour are a great idea so u can grab a coffee or cold drink and watch the world go by!!||September 19, 2016
thewandere||20||Lovely park. Nice play areas for the kids. Shame about the amount of smokers. Could benefit from taking a leaf out of central park in New York and banning smoking in the entire park. We come here for some fresh air in a very polluted city, yet our lungs are assaulted by this disgusting habit. Even in the children's playground! Its awful.||September 19, 2016
Adrian M||50||If you want to escape the city, traffic etc, this is definitely the place to go, it offers beautiful gardens, a lake and amazing water features. There are boats that can be hired and everyone is just happy, it has a great atmosphere, a wonderful place to go with the family for a picnic, plenty of open space. Just don't forget 20p's if you need the loos!||September 19, 2016

Bailey E||50||This park was huge and beautiful and green and FULL of people. A great place to stop for a picnic or rest. ||September 18, 2016
williamelliotta||50||I make sure I book a room near Hyde Park and schedule a down day every 3rd day in London. This affords me time to take in the sights of Hyde Park, relax, and enjoy watching people from all different cultures of the world interact. Such a great lesson for children to experience. There is always something fun to do or observe in the park, whether it is to rent a paddleboat on Serpentine Lake, observe Speaker's Corner on a Sunday morning, or just grab a coffee and sit on a bench. Kensington Park (and Palace) adjoin Hyde Park and offer additional amenities like the Princess Diana playground, or watching remote-controlled boats at Round Pond.||September 18, 2016
D E||50||Henry the VIII acquired the park from a group of Monks in 1536. The park is 350 acres and offers everything from paddle boats at The Serpentine to Kensington Palace at the far end of it. If you are a walker, a runner, yoga person or just want to sit and people watch Hyde Park offers it all. ||September 18, 2016
Alan M||50||We stayed at a hotel on Park Lane acrross from Hyde Park; I took an underpass to get over to the park with ease; once there it was easy to access the parck and the many paved trails;I tried on my first visit to run the outer perimeter keeping the roadways on my right; as the park is roughly rectangular all I had to do was keep turning left to get back to where I started; weel, that didn't work as I ended up by the Serpentine; no problem though, lots of people to help with directions and there are mapboards located throughout;The park is where the BBC host live concerts; while we were there, a concert featuring Elton John took place right across Park Lane from the hotelIThe park is well utilized by the locals for jogging, running, and other activities as you might expect; it similar to other parks, but it does give a nice qiet interlude to the bustle of London||September 18, 2016
KASHOO188||40||Visited the park with family on a very hot day and had a picnic. The part of the grass we sat on was dead and uncomfy to sit. The idea of the small playground was nice for kids, it had a water fountain and kids had a water fight. we sat in front of the fountains. Big park, small children will get tired walking all of it but its nice for kids. Good views of the river and generally a clean and safe park||September 18, 2016

Christian-traveler23||40||Great park for relaxing, it's huge with little bits to do, will suit most people. You can hire bicycles and cycle in the park. Also a huge plus for me- it's great for skating, the strip around the park is perfect for skating. It's one of my favourite places for skating as there are always other skaters there.||September 18, 2016
TonyandAnn G||50||We had a great time with our grandson visiting and experiencing the Princess Diana memorial feature. She would throughly approve of the amazing fun that the children were having.||September 17, 2016

raj s||50||This is one of my favorite places in London. All you need to have is some free-time to relax. Just lie down on the green grass and can spend as much as time possible. Being in the middle of the city yet away from the hustle bustle of busiest city..||September 17, 2016

Lhall186356||50||Amazing weather 26 degrees ! Party in the park -on every year a must do for locals and tourist - great venue and atmosphere - we went here with great friends had a lovley time - beware of hotels double booking and have a back up plan like a spare tent ! ||September 16, 2016
podrozniczka60||40||Beautiful, peaceful park, ideal for a stroll... We actually did a lot of pleasant walking here and had our little picnic.We visited the Rose Garden and observe boaters on the pond. The park exemplifies how much the ethnic make up of London has changed. The Grand Entrance and Wellington Arch are impressive but the main site of interest in the park is arguably Speakers' Corner. We did not indulge in chair rentals but they are available here and if one is tired and in need of relaxation they may be a very good idea.||September 16, 2016
clarek210||50||Large amazing outdoor space!! You will forget you are in the heart of London. I came here with my son, ny sister and my baby niece, it's a vast amount of green space with a duck pond that you can go on pedalos on, there's some ice cream stands and public toilets.It's so beautiful if you are in London on a hot day definitely go for a visit.||September 16, 2016

liufenglianabc||40||If you want to have a relaxing time with your friends, family or even by yourself, you definitely should go to Hyde Park. It's a really good place with different kind of colorful flowers and trees. I went there in the summer at 18 o'clock and there was a really superb sunset. Me and my friends sat in the outside part of Sepertine Bar and enjoyed the time there. This bar and restaurant is a good choice for some drinks and snacks after work. But, it's really crowded between 5pm and 8pm (in the summer, at least). Everybody leaves work and goes there to relax. There isn't a lot of tables outside and the inside part is really hot with no air conditioning. So you have to go earlier! What I most liked of this restaurant was the view. It is in front of a huge lake and you can feel the pure air and good vibes. There was a lot of people on the paddleboats that you can rent for free. If you don't want to go to the restaurant, there are some chairs available for free in the park and you can sit for drink or a meal. The atmosphere is fantastic, there are a lot of kids playing, squirrels, birds, ducks. There's also a fountain memorial to Princess Diana. In the summer, a lot of people and kids go there to refresh, because it looks like a river and there you can paddle your feets and hands. Hyde Park is closer to Kensigton Palace, Albert Memorial and Winter Wonderland. You can't miss it!||September 16, 2016
Judy R||50||Hyde Park is lovely. Being so central to London, it's easy to get to and a lovely place to just sit and watch the world go by. People of every shape, colour, and size wander through. ||September 15, 2016
874AndrewE||40||Many miles of walking paths - although the majority of it is fairly typical for an urban park. Many green areas, a man-made pond, and some limited wooded areas. A highlight is the Rose Garden, which is recommended. Wellington Arch at one end as one approaches Buckingham Palace. After a visit to the Palace, walking back through Hyde Park, we came upon comfortable beach chairs for rental. At 1.60 per chair per hour, not cheap, but very welcome - it was hard to not doze off looking at the water, birds, and people walking along. Several places around the water to stop for tea, ice cream and food.||September 15, 2016
aplacetocrash||50||Such a lovely park in the middle of the city. Fun to cycle through and see everyone enjoying the much needed sun||September 15, 2016
Ktevans88||40||Helps we had a beautiful day in the park, but it was lovely to walk around, rented a boat which was fun to row around then had some really great food in the serpentine restaurant!!! Definitely recommend ||September 15, 2016
Kathryn N||50||I spent so many days in Hyde Park over the summer - great space, row boat hire, cafe, deck chairs, great atmosphere!! ||September 15, 2016
vanessa k||50||I went 1st thing in the morning when all the joggers, cyclists, dog-walkers are out, so a good way of experiencing local London life. Plenty to see such as Peter Pan statue and the Italian gardens, which are lovely, and several rest stops which are very important as it's huge! Some cafes dotted about, very pleasant if a little pricey. You could easily spend several hours here wandering about, including a visit to the Serpentine Gallery. Other photo opportunities include the Albert Memorial, Bandstand and Apsley House/Wellington Arch at the south corner. ||September 15, 2016
TravelingToast||40||If you've just spent the whole day walking around the city - the last thing you are probably going to want to do is walk around this park. However, there are bus stops that circle it, so you can stop exactly where you want to be.The ponds are nice - there are a million ducks, geese, and swans there, and a million people feeding them bread. (Hint: there are signs everywhere that say not to feed the birds bread, but gives healthy alternatives!). One thing that surprised us was how many seemingly non-natives there were there.||September 15, 2016
H5415RF_||50||I like stay in Hyde-park every day during my visit feed the birds and walk around the lake but this time they close the pedestrian path for BBC music events this made me unhappy ||September 15, 2016
Adventurer2day||50||Take time to stroll and enjoy some tranquil moments away from the frantic pace around you!Beautiful and worth effort to take a break in the right setting.When the sun shines on the water, vs. having London rain on your parade, you won't regret making time.||September 15, 2016
788debrac||50||Maybe the best park we have visited. We arrived about 6pm & took a picture of the park map to navigate around due to the large scale. Beautiful floral gardens & wide open grassy areas where many people picnic. Monuments & Princess Diana memorial. People biking, skating, strolling & boating. We went to the cafe & walked around with a snack & ale. A wonderful peaceful way to enjoy nature & wildlife. Londoners come to the parks after work to relax & spend time with friends. Europeans really know how to enjoy life's simple pleasures.||September 14, 2016
Andy W||40||First time in the park ,as we made our way through on our way to the V&A museum,lots of people enjoying some really nice weather walking ,jogging ,boating on the Serpentine generally having a good time with their family's .There is also a place to eat in the middle of the park were you can relax and enjoy the view of the water ,this park is also next to Kensington park and the palace.||September 14, 2016
deejay90210||50||A huge park situated right in the city center. Very peaceful and beautiful. A perfect place to spend your evening away from the hectic pace of the city. Many entrances, and is easily accessible through public transport. Beautiful lake with ducks in the center of the park adds to its beauty.||September 14, 2016
emsykes||50||Absolutely gorgeous, so well looked after. We came here during a weekend stay in London and although we came during the Race for Life run, it was still so beautiful. The lake is amazing, a wonderful place to take anyone and many photos!||September 14, 2016
ayydxb||40||If your planning to spend your afternoon in the park with your children, it might not be a good idea since there is only one junior playground and it is quite busy.However there is plenty of open fields where you can play ball sports of any kind.The amenities are limited and toilets are in a bad condition. If you feel like jogging or riding a bike or your Horse (believe me there is a seperate dirt line for horse riders) than it is a really good idea to enjoy this park.||September 14, 2016
Sol813||50||I alway try to have at least a lovely walk through Hyde Park during a stay in London, no matter if it is in summer or winter. In summertime one can rent a deckchair for a relaxed afternoon - with or without a picknick from the nearby restaurant. And the Serpentine Gallery is always worth a visit. It might be a bit crowded on weekends but thanks to the vastnessof the gardens one will alway find a lovely place to be. Highly recommended. ||September 14, 2016
ankovore||50||Last night at the proms and bbc radio 2 festival in a day, amazing weekend had by all. Easy access to Hyde Park Corner tube station.||September 14, 2016
aussieskiman||50||This park has been in London for so long..when you stroll here just think about who walked here in the past. The Kings and Queens and nobles of yesteryear. A summer weekend is wonderful, so many people out strolling. Make sure you walk to the Albert Memorial and Albert Hall. ||September 13, 2016
Mariana L||50||a huge park, with lots of wild life that lives in peace with the visitors, great space to think and have a good day||September 13, 2016
mansoura737||40||Came here with family on a hot summers day. We entered through the Marble Arch side and made use of the wonderful grassy area. We were lucky to have been handed over the deck chair from someone who didn't need them. So relaxing was the park, some of us in the group took a nap too. ||September 13, 2016
Ahmed A||40||See some lovely birds, squirl, butterflies. The lake is lovely for pedalo or kano... take a camera for special shots especially when sun is out. ||September 13, 2016
a1m1p1a1||30||The garden is linked to Kesington gardens, and has a nice set of expositions in the Serpentine galleries and pavilion.||September 13, 2016
David C||50||Definitely needs a visit. Whether for a picnic, or a leisurely stroll, the park is sure to charm you. The squirrels are quite friendly here, so why not befriend them. ||September 13, 2016
Cph-Grl93||40||Hyde Park is a lovely place to go for a walk, run, bicycle ride or any other activity. There is also a café near the lake which is pretty decent and gives your an amazing view. I visited around the time of the sunset and it was stunningly gorgeous. I unfortunately do not remember the name of the café. All in all a place which offers more than a regular park would. ||September 13, 2016
dakes25||50||Lovely park to spend time in and great to see so many people using it, runners, cyclists, families and couples. Can sit and watch people on the Lake or just watch the world go by. Plenty of seats around and a couple of cafes for refreshments.||September 13, 2016
Alistair S||50||Walking shoes are a must.You can just walk through and admire the scenery, or stop and have an ice cream, or feed the ducks. a perfectly relaxing day.||September 13, 2016

Naiza A||40||London’s famous park. It’s a huge park and one can spend an entire day in the park, relaxing, having picnics or simply just enjoying the lush greenery. Located in zone 1, the park is easily reachable via underground or bus.||September 13, 2016
Darragh S||50||Every season - there is something to enjoy in the park. Winder wonderland, summer concerts or just an walk around the Italian garden.||September 13, 2016

This is so large and well kept such a joy to run through and discover new sights. What an amazing experience to be in London for Elton John concert the other day. Even without tickets could hear the amazing show||September 12, 2016
tammyp750||50||Lots of walking, has seats too, monuments to see on the way. Good to escape major crowds on a busy day. Pretty special huge oasis i the middle if town.||September 12, 2016
lgsusimport||40||I love this place, there us always something new to discover. It is a great place to walk and stroll through. Starting at the north west side with the infamous Speakers Corner, so popular at the weekends where anyone with something to say can literally climb up on their soap box and say it to whom ever will stop and listen. The park offers plenty of open space to sit, play ball games and relax in the good weather. There is a sand track for horses, a beautiful lake where you can rent boats and a small art gallery as well as tea rooms. Wander, explore and enjoy........||September 12, 2016
Jon7709||40||Nice park that has a lot of history and various things to see and do for adults and kids. You can easily kill a few hours here if the weather is decent, if nothing else just people-watching||September 12, 2016
WeatherlyAir||40||I stayed just across the street from this park on my recent trip to London and spent a couple mornings walking through it and it's neighbouring parks. I does seem to get a bit busy during the day but was quite pleasant in the early mornings. I enjoyed the nearby Kensington gardens a little bit more although Hyde is a notable place as well.||September 12, 2016
Stephane B||50||Beautiful park to sit and relax close by the lake or walk or cycle from one end to the other! Beautiful nature away from the circulation noise and pollution! It is nice to spend an afternoon there!||September 12, 2016

deborahk3||50||Hyde Park is beautiful and is a little bit of the countryside in the middle of London. It is a fantastic venue for concerts and BBC2 Proms in the Park. I walked along the Serpentine on a lovely sunny September day on my way to meet friends. It was quite busy but still relaxing. Lots were people were enjoying boating activities on the Serpentine and generally enjoying the sunshine. A must visit place when in London.||September 12, 2016
Windy0309||50||This park is huge, there are lots of things to do there including pedalos, rowing boats, food stalls, cafes and play equipment. I saw people on bikes, skateboards, roller blades and there was something going on in every park of the park. Looked like a brilliant day out! We were just walking through while sight seeing but it looked like a lovely place to take our family. ||September 12, 2016
mariaant||50||Can be likened to Central Park in NYC but better! Stunning grounds, lakes, ponds, statues, art, gardens, wild-land, cycling, pedalos, and green parrots to top it off! Several cafes to grab a drink or a bite to eat, but be warned these are massively overpriced! Take a long stroll through the park and watch the world go by. You forget you're in the middle of London. One of the greatest parks London has to offer.||September 12, 2016
Flantheman2334||40||Our second year attending this event. Extremely well organised, from the edge of the park right through to entry. Plenty of stewards and info boards.Others in our party had been to see the triathlon at the olympics and concurred that that event was equally well presented.The park itself is worth visiting when no functions are happening, but when they are, it is very impressive the way they are managed.||September 12, 2016
Misty64_13||50||Just back from festival in a day, great fab day as normal.Hyde Park catering very well with this event, plenty of water stations and toilets along with food and drink.||September 12, 2016
WOODBOURNE20||50||Well organised lovely place to sit and enjoy the music. Only one little suggestion , look at the long range weather forecast before planning as my clothes are still not dry after Saturday's awful weather. Didn't dampen the spirits too much as the music and atmosphere were amazing. ||September 12, 2016
86frankiet||50||Second time attending this event in the Park. A ticket costs £42 for 8 hrs plus of entertainment. Bring a picnic blanket and read the restrictions on entry carefully. I find the event well organised with a large variety of food and drink on offer.Good to see old favourites Elton John, The Quo and Madness but would also like to see more new talent.Good day out with a little prep before going.||September 12, 2016
Dawn s||50||Lovely park you wouldnt believe you are in the bustling Capital. So tranquil the weather was amazing for early September so that helped. My family spent the day lazing in the sunshine listening to Radio 2's festival in a day. ||September 12, 2016
lindam264||50||We spent a lot of our trip in Hyde Park. We hired bikes over two days and enjoyed the sunshine. Unfortunately part of the park was closed off due to the Proms but it was still amazing. A big bit of greenery amongst the high flights of London.||September 11, 2016
kimo26||50||It is a good walk from Marble Arch through to the Serpentine Lake on which you can do boating activities and the Princess Diana memorial pond. The Kensington Palace, café and gardens were really pretty and relaxing, especially the afternoon tea at the café.||September 11, 2016
cliff d||40||Great venue for the BBC2 Proms in the park . Wide open spaces along with wooded areas . Very well organised by the BBC , 30,000 in the park and no real queues for anything . Look out for the resident bright green ring necked parakeets flying about and being very noisy .||September 11, 2016
pauljudith||50||a sunny day , and a lovely place to walk and chill. we strolled through the parks taking in the albert memorial, peter pan and the flower walk - a nice way to spend a couple of hours .||September 11, 2016
Danooo73||50||Second year that we have been to the Proms in the Park event.We had a great evening (despite the weather in the earlier part of evening).As a party of 10 we pitched up at the Champagne Bar and sat around 2 large picnic benches which had a large jumbrella over them.Laurent Perrier Rose was £80 a bottle and jugs of Pimms were £30.Lots of food concessions around catering for all tastes.The event hosted a number of live acts including ABC, Rick Astley, Frankie Vallie, All Saints & The Feeling.The highlight of the evening for me is when they switch over to the Royal Albert Hall for the finalé including Rule Britannia, Pomp & Circumstance - Land of Hope and Glory, Jerusalem and the National Anthem.We stayed locally so were not rushing for the last train.||September 11, 2016
Rydel100||50||The weather today was just perfect so decided to head to Hyde Park for the day for a picnic. Spent the morning walking around before arriving at the Princess Diana Memorial fountain which was just fantastic for kids. They had a ball. Overall a lot of walking through a wonderful park. ||September 11, 2016
Jackie C||50||We have visited Hyde Park on a number of occasions and nerve been disappointed. It's hard to believe that just a stones throw away you can be in the hustle and bustle of central London as walking through the park gives such a serene but interesting atmosphere. On this occasion we attend Proms in the Park. Not our first visit and it won't be our last as such a perfect setting for such an outstanding out door event. If you haven't been give it a go - you won't be disappointed and will want to go again.||September 11, 2016
DeeAnneWhite||50||There is always something going on in Hyde Park, from concerts to sunny days spent strolling, but the Christmas Market is our favourite, and it's just a hop from The Dorchester, another lovely spot to stay.||September 11, 2016
Khanna_Nishant||50||Visit it in spring and bask in the sun on lush green gardens amongst flower beds. The British take immense pride in maintaining this place and allowing freedom to speak. This place should not be missed ever. ||September 11, 2016
SOUP0154||50||Loved walking through Hyde Park. Brave swimmers were in the water on a rainy morning. Lots of monuments and the Princess Diana memorial which opens daily at 10. There were a lot of bright green birds coming down from the trees resting on the shoulders of visitors for food which was amazing to see. ||September 11, 2016
Ethan M||50||Great place to go site seeing, people watching, skating, running, yoga, you name it it is done here. Relaxing atmosphere taking in the beautiful landscape. The river area is beautiful along with all the feathered friends you could think to have. Hire kayaks or ride a bike. Super chill place. They even have restaurants along the water way.||September 10, 2016

VMag07||50||Really one of the things I am so happy to see because I was able to see how family bonded without using technology. Technology has been really a part of our life that sometimes it took mostly of our time even if we are with our families. Going to this place made me miss my family at home. Best place to go if you wanted to have fun with your love ones! ||September 7, 2016
Emilysmithclark||50||I love London for soo many reasons, but one of them is definitely the always green and huge parks. This one is quiet, you can chill out, feed squirrels, love it.||September 7, 2016
Beatrice-TA||40||This park is huge with lots of different areas including speakers corner, the lido, princess Diana memorial park, the Serpentine, and The Italian Gardens to name just a few.You will need a good few hours if you want to see a lot of the park or you can use it as a cut through with many paths to follow.You can sit and relax and you would never know that you are in the middle of a city.Food and drink can be expensive so take your own.||September 7, 2016
Diane_Cumbria||50||Strolled from one end to the other (about 20 mins if walking brisk ly), watching birds inc variety of ducks on Serpentine, plus ring necked parakeet flying over and Egyption Geese grazing.

Christine F||50||This place is great you literally can spend all day here and still not have seen it all. You can pay for bike at entrance I recommend to do that pay £2 and have it all day cycling around the park as you can get around quicker and it's more fun ||September 6, 2016
annapurna2016||50||A visit to London is surely incomplete without a visit to the famous Hyde Park. Stroll along for just an hour or spend half a day with a picnic lunch - the choice is yours! Enchanting blooms, vast trees, open green spaces make this park an attractive way to relax and enjoy London!||September 6, 2016
John O||50||It really is bizzare. You are on of the world's busiest shopping streets (Oxford Street), you saunter through Marble Arch, stroll down North then West Carriage Drive and you reach the Serpentine. Not a noisy engine in earshot, fabulous!||September 6, 2016
HayleyM249||40||I love the parks in London but this is one of my favourites. It's really easy to get to. it's very nice and clean. We walked all round the serpentine (the lake). The rose garden is very pretty, even if you're not into roses go and have a walk through. The Diana memorial fountain is really nice, we visited it on a hot day and there were lots of children playing in the run offs from the fountain, I even dipped my feet in. I always want to visit this park when I go to London. ||September 6, 2016

Paul R||40||If you want to relax and forget you are in a city this can be a great way to feel a little more in the country = some areas around the main roads can get busy in tourist times but generally the overall park is well maintained and has lots to see||September 5, 2016
InvernessGal||40||Strolled through after our dinner and found ourselves getting lost in the beauty of Hyde Park. Pretty gardens, flowers and monuments--would have stayed longer but didn't want to be there after dark. There were tons of white swans which were beautiful (and plentiful) from afar. They were a little pesky when eating out bread crumbs. ||September 5, 2016
D8669VBlauram||50||I absolutely love everything about this park: the majestic trees, green lawns, tons of activity, people watching, and on and on. Our family of four (two adults and two teens) love the Serpentine and taking a boat out on the lake on a sunny day and rowing around and listening to music. So much to see and do at this park. Love it.||September 5, 2016
Kate S||30||We got lost in here looking for the toilets due to poor signage. The park hosts some impressive statues but is mostly sparse and the grass was in an appalling condition||September 5, 2016
PawPawCheshire||50||WOW....Absolutely stunning Oasis in a city??!! I was totally blown away with this place. Beautiful statues and memorials. Well kept gardens. play areas . Serpentine lido. Swimming. Pedalos cafes. Nature, archtecture. Amazing bird watching. ESPECIALLY watching the parakeets feeding from the hands of visitors. Italian Garden beautiful .LOVED Hyde Park. A sunny day added to the pleasure. It is a day out on it's own in my opinion. ||September 5, 2016

AJCC1||30||This is your typical park in the city. It reminds me a bit of Central Park in New York. There are some secluded sections with beautiful trees and other parts where you can play sports, rent sun deck sharia to catch some rays or just enjoy some quality time with family and friends. ||September 5, 2016
NaomiHeanen||50||We hired bikes at Kensington Park and cycled down through to Hyde Park and it was absolutely brilliant. We saw a whole different view of London. Lots of places to have a rest and do some people watching. ||September 5, 2016
old_romantics_2000||50||We visited on a week day and found the park bustling. Although it was busy there was little noise and plenty of space. There are various cycle free walks around the park and different areas to visit. Also you can hire out a variety of boats on the lake. There is also a good cafe about half way through the park. On a hot sunny day there are plenty of shaded areas and walks.||September 5, 2016
annaingram97||50||Serene in this urban metropolis, makes you feel like you could be in the countryside somewhere, best on a sunny day with ice cream||September 5, 2016
George H||40||I had a few hours to spare and had never visited the Park previously. I was a sunny day so just sauntered around taking a few photographs. Wandered to the Serpentine where nearby was an outdoor exhibition of modern architecture. There was plenty of seating round the Park to alleviate my tiring feet.||September 5, 2016
mrshamilt0n||50||we hired Boris bikes and had a lovely cycle around the park. Lovely park and well maintained. Watch out though as you cannot go everywhere on a bike so you have to stick to the correct area.||September 5, 2016
LaurenG2810||50||Loved the atmosphere of the park. Soccer games, children playing, dogs running, and cafe eating are all taking place in the park and it feels great to enjoy an inexpensive day with locals.||September 4, 2016
NewcastleJoanne||50||What can you say about Hyde Park? It's a great area to relax, to sunbathe on a sunny British summer's day, to walk and clear your mind and to go for a jog! It's a beautiful park in the middle of London. If you want to sit with the crowds you can, and if you want to be by yourself, you can.||September 4, 2016
TelfordAdventurer||50||One of my favourite places in london. Been here many times and always amazes me. First time with my children though who enjoyed riding around on their scooters...the kiddies park and peddle boats.Some of the signs could be a bit better as I found myself walking the wrong way a couple of times looking for the best way to the underground but that's partly due its enormity.Here you also get a good reflection of london as theres a mix of tourists and maybe locals as they cycle around or go on daily jogs.||September 4, 2016
kellyraggarodgers||40||This is an extremely large green space in the centre of London, loads of space for the kids to burn off energy or somewhere to spend your lunch or sunbathe. The Serpentine is massive, boats are available & you can also swim in a prepared area. There are places to eat & get snacks. The children have play areas to use too.||September 4, 2016
Stephanie S||40||We were nearby Hyde Park having tea and decided to take a stroll afterward. It's a large park, with a large lake in the middle. It's basically your typical park, it had patches of flowers and small fountains, then a large walkway with open fields. I saw a few people playing soccer, but most were hanging out on park benches or rented chairs in the grass. It's something to see if you are in the area.||September 4, 2016
Amin A||50||Always beautiful in any weather. Must be it's location right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of London city centre that makes it so luring. Can spend hours strolling here. Beautiful to go back to nature when you're in such a large and busy city.||September 4, 2016

TheCorts||50||Hyde Park is a magical place! There is so much to see and do - visit Gardens, Princess Diana's special monument (a water feature), boat ride, sun bathe, bike, watch a concert, picnic, and on and one. We stopped at Harrod's, a short walk away, and picked up all sorts of wonderful treats, to enjoy picnic-style in the park. It was fantastic! After eating and relaxing, we strolled the park, walked by the water, people watched, and listened to the great music coming from the outdoor theater where a summer concert was being held. The park feels incredibly safe, with lots of people out and about. Can't imagine a trip to London without a great afternoon, and picnic, in Hyde Park!||September 3, 2016
Lysander B||50||It is so nice to be in the lovely fresh air in the urban city of London. It is great to be in with all the birds and all that||September 3, 2016
Maria B||20||The substantial part of the park looks absolutely disgusting - from Oxford str to Hyde park corner metro station , it is screened off with the huge fence. That makes you drag yourself for few miles along this ugly barrier . " what a pretty sight!!!"||September 3, 2016
ScottsdaleFoody2008||50||Wonderful park! I love walking here after getting off the plane crossing the pond. It's beautiful and many nearby sights are viewable from here.

Vike190||40||Beautiful gardens and nice place to visit. Lots of joggers about the place and cyclists but didn't spoil the stroll. Nice relaxing break from the busy city. Recommend if you need the break. ||September 3, 2016
dnny||50||Largest green cover in central London gives picturesque view to travellars. Small trees , Water bodies makes it more attractive.Togather with St James Park it look like lawn to Buckingham Palace. A sunny winter day attracts large no of tourists and londener.Flanked by marble arch on one side it is accessible from Oxford Street as well.Sundays are special with crowded speaker's corner.One can have true taste of democracy as it gives freedom to anyone to speak on any subject.One simply can not afford to miss it.||September 3, 2016

kevinbB8430AX||50||What a great place to take a break after a day filled exploring the city. Just find a place to sit down on the grass and relax. A great oasis in the middle of the city. Not a bad place to people watch either. There is a lake that you can rent paddle boats on and even swim. We were content just to watch everyone else. Very relaxing. And a good place to ride a bike. You can rent them nearby. ||September 2, 2016
Axemenfan||40||I have used Hyde Park on many occasions for a run/jog in the early morning. The footpaths are safe and in good condition and there is rarely any dogs' mess or other fouling. The views across London are magical on an early summer morning.||September 2, 2016
Pierre B||50||I go there every week. You can see animals, trees, plants people and relax in the middle of the grass.Un des symboles de Londres. Vous y verrez des animaux en liberte, plantes, arbres, etc... Super pour un pique nique!||September 2, 2016
alialadawi||50||I visited Hyde park on a sunny day after getting out of the Hyde park. I loved the lake inside where you can rent small boats and see birds or just sit and relax or have a bite. Or cycle. I mean I would not mind spending a full day here especially when the weather is nice. ||September 1, 2016
Faris A||50||It's a perfect place to get rid of city pressures and to do exercises. I sometimes have my breakfast there at Lido restaurant which is a good place in front of the lake.||September 1, 2016

scenario34||40||We walked from Buckingham Palace through Hyde Park to the Serpentine. The lake is beautiful and the park is stunningly big. And you can find places for a drink or lunch. So few capital cities in the world have parks of this size in their centres. It's a great facility and Londoners can be seen enjoying themselves. ||August 31, 2016

erinsP4047SG||50||We took an early morning walk through Hyde Park before leaving London. This is a lovely, large metropolitan park. It is very clean and safe. However, it is so large that I needed my GPS to get back to the hotel!||August 30, 2016
Shelley Q||50||Is there anyone else in the world that can do beautiful green space like the English? Hyde Park is a prime example of something the English have been doing for generations and they just keep getting better at it. Between the flora and fauna it is a venerable menagerie of wildlife and nature right in the middle of a beautiful and bustling metropolis of one of the world's most lovely and exciting cities. I would strongly advise anyone with a spare moment or two to take the time to find the Peter Pan statue as it is a stunningly crafted specimen of art in its own right but also a wonderful tribute to the innocence and beauty of childhood. Soak in the birds and squirrels and the frolic through the sometimes tall grass, languish under the shade of a billowing tree with a picnic if the sun has granted you the warmth of its presence. If you want a taste of something more structured, make your way to Kensington Palace and wander through their gardens, also beautiful and well maintained. This is a free park that is the height of what a city park can offer, don't miss out!||August 30, 2016
Evelynne G||50||This is a most beautiful park with lots of different attractive areas. A walk through this massive parkis like being in a different country. There are many activities happening. Horse riding is one . There is a delightful lake area . Even a drive through this park land is delightful||August 30, 2016
Mary H||50||This beautiful park will having you walking for miles without realizing it. Foliage and flowers and fountains tucked inside London. But there's ice cream in the center in case you think it's too healthy a trip. Lots of people but doesn't feel crowded. We got surprised by rain but thought it was lovely walking under the trees for cover. Absolute must for any London visit. ||August 30, 2016
BronwenLouw||40||Great park. The swans on the Sepentine are particularly beautiful. Loved the Peter Pan statue. Only downside is that the occassional small cafe's are rather pricy.||August 30, 2016
Randm_Traveller||50||Hyde Park is one of the most amazing places in all of London. It is an escape from everything around it. The people watching is fabulous. The Italian fountains are gorgeous and a perfect place to sit and relax. In summer you can catch a concert, in winter, there is a winter fair. It is free to be in the park. If you have time, pay for a chair and sit and relax. ||August 30, 2016
SilverlakeJake||50||We were in London for a couple days and fortunately the weather was a cooperating tremendously. We spent two solid hours exploring the park and all its beauty. It makes for a nice walk to start on one end and work your way across and toward Buckingham Palace, although that might be a bit too much for some.||August 30, 2016
Yi z||50||This park is busy from noon til night, I love how as you walk along the main area near the lake and see performers, singers, fitness fanatics and rollerblading and skateboarding tricks. You can hire bikes for a day and cycle all parks.||August 30, 2016
nonsense193||50||A wonderful well layed out park. I enjoyed the paths around the ponds with the beautiful swains. Great large old trees to give you plenty of shade. Take your time and go for a stroll.||August 30, 2016

13bernadettee||50||I really love Hyde Park - the walks, the gardens, Serpentine Lake, Speaker's Corner and watching children joyfully frolicking in the wonderful Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain . But put aside an entire morning or afternoon to truly enjoy it. This is not an experience to be rushed!||August 30, 2016
david l||50||Ok it was a bit damp at times but still nice to wander round and have tea and cake in a cafe . Love the Serpentine pretty piece of waterway , and quite busy it was nice to get out of London streets and sea flowers etc.||August 30, 2016

Priscilla A||50||Take at least a few hours and walk around. So much to see here. Kensington Palace, the pond with the swans, various statues. It took me two trips to find the Peter Pan statue. A great place for people watching. A few of the elderly people feed the squirrels and they will come right up and eat out of their palms. This park is lovely in Spring.||August 29, 2016
Nicola G||50||Lovely surroundings. Lots to see.. Diana water memorial . Italian gardens are beautiful. Serpentine Café is well worth a visit. Beautiful to walk through.||August 29, 2016

ConorSD1||50||What a beautiful place! My girlfriend and I went on our last day in London and I wish we had a full day to enjoy it. Its beautiful, and the 200 pound for the two of us to rent a pedal boat on the lake was probably the best money spent throughout our stay! Ideal place for quiet walks and picnics!||August 28, 2016

Sherry B||30||Hyde Park is huge and has some lovely flowerbeds and fields. Overall, though, one must generally keep to the hard asphalt paths. It isn't lovely like Central Park, or wild like Stanley Park. Also, be careful as twilight falls, because there is quite a bit of violence in the park. While we were in London, there was a huge riot there one evening. Not what I hoped for.||August 28, 2016
mwood88||40||Hyde park is simply beautiful, you can forget your in the big smoke and just relax, there is nothing fast paced here. The kids love it, they love the lakes, they don't get bored here, pure tranquility! A must do to have a break from the crowds! ||August 28, 2016
Borzov||50||This huge green area in the very heart of the city is a wonderful place for walking, running or just laying down on its green surface. Through history it was a place for hangings, duels, demonstrations and public events, such was a Great Exhibition in 1851. But it is foremost a huge and wonderful lazy leisure ground for locals and tourists...||August 28, 2016
toolonginexile||50||Just to wander through the park is an enjoyable way to relax and/or exercise. It is a great way to get through London to avoid the tube or traffic fumes. Hyde Park joins up with Kensington Park so if you are stopping near one of these two great parks, before visiting other London attractions, see if you can access them by walking across the parks, you will be amazed that it is so easy to cross London.||August 27, 2016

Gerhard K||40||Went there Sunday morning from our hotel about a kilometer awy and it was very nice. You can easily run once arount the whole park wich is about 6km and ther ar so many paths that you can adapt to you liking. Its nice to start the day with some fresh air in the morning and I was surprised that there were so relatively little people there on a Sunday morning.||August 27, 2016
367giuliap||50||Hyde Park is for sure my Happy place in London! you can do wahatever you love in here, walk, run, lay down in the green, chill with some friends or just watch the world passing by. Don't loose the opportunity to get lost in Hyde Park.||August 27, 2016
UK_NW_Traveller||40||We spent a lot of time in Hyde park as part of our visit to London. Starting at Kensington palace and then working our way down to the lido area. It was a very warm day so the park was full with visitors and locals alike and it was great to see everyone enjoying themselves. You quickly forget the hustle and bustle of London life and you could be anywhere.The parks were amazing and Diana fountains were very popular with a LOT of families visiting. The boating lake was also very popular.Food and drinks were quite expensive on the park so best to take your own if you can. It's a huge park so you need to leave a lot of time to explore this area.||August 27, 2016
HBSweden||50||You cannot go to London and not visit Hyde Park. It is too big to walk round in a day. Miles and miles of grass with people just relaxing, playing, cycling, skating or just enjoying being outside. Walk down to the Serpantine or go to Speakers Corner there is so much happening there with people who are probably a little mad standing up and talking at the crowds. I loved the atmosphere. Every time I visited here I had a wonderful time and saw something different. A fantastic place to visit right in the middle of London and its free! ||August 26, 2016
Carolyn H||50||The park is quite large and can be entered from a number of areas. It's quite walkable with lots of paths and a fairly large lake in the middle. You can rent boats and paddle about. Perfect for a picnic, a walk to see Princes Diana's memorial and Prince Albert's Memorial.||August 26, 2016
Krisyyy||40||I visited Hyde Park with a friend. Having never been there before I wasn't sure what to expect. There were some very pretty, picturesque areas of flowers and trees. The Serpentine runs through a large part of the park with lots of birdlife and you can rent a paddleboat to take out on the lake which is a lovely idea. (However I think the pricing options are silly and haven't done it myself yet). There are a number of spots for food, lots of benches and also shady spots. The Princess of Wales memorial fountain is open there and a lot of families were picnicking and children paddling so a great place for a day out for anyone.||August 26, 2016
amrita n||50||Hyde Park is one of the most beautiful parks I have seen. The park is well maintained and so peaceful. A great place for a day out.||August 26, 2016

ASFP||50||I love this park, I used to live in Bayswater and this park is great for running, walking or chilling. Great for people or animal watching - there are usually people horseback riding or playing sports in the fields. Great spot to to have a picnic!||August 26, 2016
Paigeturner2||50||What a beautiful walk! London is filled with parks and green, and Hyde Park is lushly gorgeous. Do not miss the Lido Cafe on the water’s edge of the Serpentine. Tea there near the swans and ducks will be a memory for a lifetime. ||August 26, 2016

Gordon K||50||Hyde Park is a great park to go for a run or a walk. It's a very scenic and safe park for all. Relax in the park, enjoy the scenery, if you wish, or have a nice lunch at one of its cafes and watch the ducks swim by.||August 25, 2016
Hasford||50||Spent about 5 hours here today! Would recommend printing off a map before you visit , especially as it will show you the coffee stops and toilets! 20pence charge for toilet .Deckchairs for hire at reasonable prices. Pedlo and row boats available but at £24 for half an hour for a family it's quite expensive.Plenty of space for picnics and ball games etc.Paddling in the Diana Memorial fountain is fun but busy on a nice day.Visit the lido for a quieter paddling experience or an actual swim in the lake ! At about £1.80 for kids it's a good price, adults about £4.80.Nice cafe at lido too.||August 25, 2016
LightPacker288207||50||After shopping it was time to relax :) We decided to buy some food from Harrods and eat them in Hyde Park. Watching the swans and ducks swim by was most enjoyable.. After our late picnic style lunch, my daughter rented a bike while I sipped some coffee from the restaurant inside the park. After that, it was back to shopping again :) ||August 25, 2016

rknight1||50||Hyde Park London has to be one if the best parks to visit.Surrounded by beautiful scenery and the Royal Kensington Palace and the Royal Albert Hall.Also the king George Monument.A wonderful part of London to visit.||August 24, 2016
lenrhodesmusic||50||A beautiful park where you can walk for hours; or simply have a picnic under mature trees. This is a very historical place, and is well kept by the Royal Parks.||August 24, 2016
wendymR4181VY||50||This place is HUGE was so big we didn't even attempt to walk round it but great if you take a picnic & especially if it's a lovely day like we had. ||August 24, 2016
MrsShoes||50||Fantastic scenery to enjoy the glorious weather. Watch out for the cyclists though!We had a great trip out on the lake in a pedalo, here you need to watch out for other boaters who are engrossed on their mobiles instead of the surroundings - we had to manoeuvre quickly a few times to avoid crashes.Lots of green space for children to run and play, toilets were clean and there are many kiosks to purchase drinks and snacks. ||August 24, 2016
Beverley D||40||Having worn our feet out, we needed a chill. The day was hot, there were lots of people, but still plenty of spaces to sit.We took our own drinks and relaxed watching the many visitors, walking, scootering and cycling ( watch those bikes)More bins would be better - Thankyou||August 24, 2016
CharisEliz||50||One of my favourite parks in London, to get away from it all for a nice long walk. There are two lovely cafe's around the Serpentine, that are lovely to sit in to soak up the atmosphere and watch the wildlife on the water.||August 24, 2016
Teylor7||50||Hi , many many thanks to HYde park. my wife was fell happy. and she want to go here again. see you again next time.||August 24, 2016
Jane L||40||Loads to do, boating on lake or generally strolling around park. Great for family picnics. Well kept and very peaceful considering in central London.||August 24, 2016
Gawani||50||Wether the weather is hot, or the inevitable clouds descend and the sky opens up. You can be sure to experience a momentary break from the fast lanes of this giant city. Beautifully English, a mecca for watching, chilling and laughing.||August 24, 2016
Chucklelee||50||Hyde Park is a lovely place to walk around with hidden statues, art works, lake, wildlife and much more. Kept in really good condition and pleasing to the eye. Also great to run around as I took part in the Hyde Park 10k.||August 23, 2016
Marthar306||50||One can walk around Hyde Park the whole day and always see something different. The largest of the green spaces in central London, Hyde Park is a wonderful open space with lots of enclosed flower gardens. Try jogging there on your own, picnicking with your friends and family or simply regaining energy there after sitting in front of the computer the whole morning. Marvellous!||August 23, 2016
cynthias399||30||We popped in not realizing what or what wasn't there. Too far to walk around if you find you are going wrong direction. Great place to have a picnic and play, enjoy the day. I felt we wasted a lot of time we could have used for Westminister Abbey which was closed by the time we got there.||August 23, 2016
Seasiider||40||I've walked through this park on many lunchtimes. There's quite a lot more to see than just the grassy area as people sometimes say it's boring but it's not! There's a rose garden, some really lovely sculptured fountains, there's a waterfall, watch the parakeets and even see them close on the feeders near the rose garden. The Serpentine is perfect to wander around and see the geese, coots and swans. There is a silence in the park considering it's in the heart of London. And don't forget to visit the 7/7 Memorial. Very moving.||August 23, 2016
Luisa W||50||absolutely loved it, but you need a day just to walk round the park let alone visit the areas around it!||August 23, 2016
dfhghjvffc||50||I was there today with my 9 years old child. It was a sunny day, and the perfect day to show him this amazing park. If you are traveling with children ir even without, do not skip the visit in this park ! We were feeding squirrel, and ducks, and my son just loved it !! It's a beautiful Nd pastoral park and it's also good to clean your head from all the museums !Highly re commanded by me !Yaniv||August 23, 2016
Pootlemum||50||Visited twice in two days- lovely variety of areas- Italian gardens, lake, Diana memorial fountain (though expect more a river than fountain!) open grass, trees to climb, and art work to admire Wonderful to have this space in the middle of the city and makes it lovely to walk about without feeling cramped by people or inhaling traffic fumes ||August 23, 2016
CedricTrotter||40||A very nice place... for families, couples, or even alone. Nature without cars. A nice garden with trees, flowers, fountains... to walk around. And the chance to meet the hungry squirrels or the parrots that will land on your hand.||August 23, 2016
TonyTripsandTravels||50||I ve been in hide park some days ago when my mom came here in London. Is one of the things you have to see here in London, a lot of green and fresh air! Simply beautiful ||August 23, 2016
Heather W||50||Stopped at Hyde Park for a wander with my 19 year old daughter on a whim. Lovely visit to the Serpentine Gallery and the summer house art installations. Then down to the Princess Diana memorial fountains. Really enjoyable Sunday lunchtime stroll only £2.45 to park right in the middle of the park and good value way to spend a couple of hours. Will make a point of going back soon, too good to miss!||August 23, 2016
Luxib||50||great park for everything . there are pedallos in the lake and a lido too ( no steps so be prepared for exit quite slimy ! there is also the Serpantine gallery - great for architecture installations every summer and one man shows||August 23, 2016
SIngDelaware||40||Nice to have a large green space in the overcrowded city of London. I did find it confusing that they rent bikes but you can't ride them in the most of the park even though there is plenty of space. ||August 23, 2016
Larome83||50||Away from the hustle and bustle, one can experience extreme tranquillity even in the centre of town. The park is expansive and calm with lots of hidden surprises and historical references. Well worth a stroll at any season. ||August 23, 2016
fiona b||50||This park, although urge, has a cozy charm about it. The people are friendly and you see a range of people from bike riders to skaters, dog walkers to joggers and the young and old. For a great Sunday activity, head to Speakers Corner and see how long it is before you get drawn in! A great way to spend the morning before heading out for a good old Sunday roast ||August 23, 2016
jerometonnelier||50||Very relaxing, lots of trees, fountains and grass. Wether it is for sport or leisure, Hyde Park is a place that has to be seen||August 23, 2016
Fatema K||50||Hyde park is really pretty and spacious. There are bikes to rent and lots of expanses of grass to picnic or play on. Worth a visit for sure||August 23, 2016
keenskier3481||50||If you have time take a walk through one of the many well maintained Parks in London; on a sunny afternoon there is nothing better.||August 23, 2016
Vicki F||50||How awesome to see people in hired boats sailing around the lake, old striped deck chairs and families relaxing in the park. Speakers Corner was entertaining and interesting and there were some many paths to follow. One thing, we found that sometimes the paths werent so clearly marked||August 23, 2016
portland27||30||Lots of interesting things to do in the park including rowing boats, bike rides and long walks. See heaps of swans and lots of other bird life.||August 23, 2016
gandkhoward||50||Beautiful park. Royal soldiers ride throw go every morning. Nice jogging path. They rent nice chairs to sit in.||August 22, 2016

BlackyTheTravelhound||50||We loved walking through Hyde Park. The grounds are lovely. We especially loved watching the geese and birds in the park.||August 22, 2016
Koray D||50||very nice park in the middle of London, perfect place for escaping from stress of the city. There is a cafe called Orangery near to Kensington Garden in Hyde Park, perfect place to have tea or coffee with nice cakes, scones and sandwiches.||August 22, 2016
Pinguin||50||Spent a Sunday afternoon in the park with wife & children - 13 & 8 - incl a snack (over-priced but enjoyable) at the Serpentine Cafe, stroll by the lake, ball games and visiting the various land marks such as the Princess Diana Memorial. The park offers so much that every visit is memorable for different reasons. ||August 22, 2016
savvysolo||50||From the Victorian pet cemetery (which you have to book in advance for private visit) to the Round Pond and long and short grasses and gardens, you will never be bored. Different every hour of the day and in all types of weather and light. The noise of London shut out, you can always find a quiet spot to be at one with nature. Few changes over the years except the "populations" wandering through...||August 22, 2016
BoogieBopBruce||40||Grass, trees, water and surprisingly few people.Hyde Park s an essential on any break in London if you haven't already been (or if you have :-) )Enjoy the freedom for free||August 22, 2016
Chakravarthi N||40||Almost Everyday I visit Hyde park, this place is good in Summer season. It's very peaceful and serene. They maintain it very well. There is plenty of space to do your activities with your friends and family. A walk in the woods really calm your mind and relieves you from stress. ||August 22, 2016
TheCiotog||40||Pop along to Hyde Park on a Sunday morning and head for Speaker's Corner. The crowds are much smaller than in the 60's, and the vocal contributions more muted, but it is still worth a visit to observe how Political Correctness has invaded the aspects of Free Speech.The walk by the Serpentine is still a fine one - watch out for the cyclists who seem to be unaware of the need to warn pedestrians of their approach! Dogs are welcome.||August 22, 2016
abdelrahmansedeeq||40||I like this park a lot but i enjoyed walking around Regent's park more, I don't know why to be honest||August 22, 2016
ellioteltham19||50||Such a lovely park to walk around, even if the scorching weekend weather you will still be able to get a nice amount of space to yourself.||August 22, 2016
millvalle||50||Perfect outing for a summer's day. Away from the traffic and crowds, strolling in nature, lying on the grass eating your sandwich.||August 21, 2016
MrSuperMario||50||Hyde Park is one of the most beautiful parks not only in London but in the world. The serpentine is wonderful and in the summer months you can hire a pedalo. Simply wonderful. ||August 21, 2016
VickyD67210||50||Me and my partner spent the weekend in London for a special occasion. We went to Hyde park and it was lovely, it's clean and had a nice atmosphere with all the families around. We stopped for ice cream and went on the pedal boats. If you're in London you should visit Hyde park ||August 21, 2016
ironmancrazy||50||We spent a couple of hours visiting galleries, walking around the lake and having coffee. The cycling and walking paths were wide and busy, the pedal boats on the water were in good use. Diana's water monument is popular and filled with the shrieks and laughter of children. A lovely way to spend a Sunday. ||August 21, 2016
teresamH3335ZU||50||This park is massive and totally beautiful , boating lake , feeding wild parrots , Diana fountain which is free fun , Italian fountains which were breath taking . Swing park small and was packed and unpleasant . ||August 21, 2016
PhilClarke11||50||I don't run in London often, but of all the places I have Hyde park is by far the best. With the serpentine to run round, wide flat paths and a level of cleanliness that always surprises - plus swans/geese/squirrels for days it is a haven in a built up area. Also a good spot to just people watch or lounge on the grass, if you want to chill in London look no further. ||August 21, 2016
KhalifaA81||40||We went to Hyde park to do some sport after a heavy lunch. Rental a bicycle over there was a good choice, after that you can have an ice-cream by the lack and enjoy the view.||August 21, 2016
Cathy632016||30||Hyde Park is a wonderful place to visit and relax when visiting London. However, services including eating at the Rangers Lodge, are exorbitantly expensive. The view of the Rangers Lodge overlooking the lake is lovely and given that one may be at Hyde Park for many hours, one might be ready through the teeth for having a drink or something to eat. I don't find its fair that in Hyde Park one doesn't have the option of buying better value snacks - if one is there with children, one might end up paying a packet for a family meal at the Hyde Park restaurant. If a family is going for a day at Hyde Park's I would suggest buying some bottled water and some other delicious good-value snacks from some supermarket. Then one might take a tea/coffee at the Hyde Park restaurant without breaking the bank with the meal bill.If weather permits, taking a paddle boat on the lake is a lovely relaxing activity. Again, since the service is given by a monopoly, the prices for a family become rather steep. Personally, I would spend less at the restaurant and splash on the paddling boat experience.||August 21, 2016
gracesamantha2016||50||we visited this twice once on a weekday when it was a huge ground with a few people relaxing and walking by. and then again on a weekend when it became a maze of activity with people on boxes talking about whatever they felt strongly about, street performers, families, dogs, it was a bit like a street fair. Fun. Do go.||August 21, 2016
kl417g||50||I love Speaker's Corner on a Sunday. Anyone can bring a platform (milk crate, for instance) and speak on any subject. Some are even rather bazzare. ||August 21, 2016
Ann H||40||Nice to sit and chill out near to Marble Arch if you work through this massive park you come out the other end at Knightsbridge where the famous harrords.||August 21, 2016
neowulf93||40||Nice place to spend some time walking. Didnt see the entire park, but the parts I did see were good. ||August 21, 2016
Michael H||50||We stayed nearby and loved the park for runs and walks. It was summer and it was looking great. The serpentine galleries always has some interesting exhibitions and usually worth looking. The bikes can be a bit annoying as they whizz by so be careful and make sure your not walking in the bike lanes !!! Londoners bikers will usually helpfully tell you if you get it wrong !! ||August 20, 2016
londoner810508||50||I wish I can find time every time I've been there and stay in this beautiful park at least couple of hours. It's beautiful even when it's rain.||August 20, 2016
candcaba||50||Hyde Park is very large, with lots to do and see. I recommend just walking around the park. There are surprises everywhere.Bikes aren't permitted in most of the paths inside the park, but you can ride around the perimeter. ||August 20, 2016
Lesley S||40||Always amazes me how peaceful it always seems in Hyde park even though it is fairly crowded juking the summer holidays . A peaceful haven amist the chaos surrounding its boarders !||August 20, 2016
Nicky712||50||We enjoyed a relaxing day in the park which started with morning coffee at the Serpentine, lakeside cafe & restaurant followed by an hour on a pedal on the lake. The flowers and gardens were beautiful. You wouldn't have known you were in central London!||August 20, 2016
Hussam A||50||You don't need a lot of money to enjoy hyde park. Its an amazing place to walk the paddle boats are fun. Great place to enjoy the open air. ||August 20, 2016
MohammadA6529||40||This park has reputation especially outside UK, tourists usually go there, but i couldn't figure out what is distinguished in this park compared to other, it even was crowded which was not fun at all. I spent 2 hours there with my wife and little kids, but never went back.I visited this park alone 2 years back in May, and it was better since it was low season. ||August 20, 2016
SarahPDL||50||I used to take long walks in the park during the summer. It is a magnificent park, and you can never tire of exploring itI used to walk there with my father, and have fond memories of our walks and convos time. Love it & miss it, and would recommend as a must visit for anyone in London.||August 20, 2016

ATBrighton||50||So much to look at beautiful in the centre of London! Diana fountain superb. Pleasant cafe. We would liked to try solar powered boat however was not working.||August 20, 2016
Dorina D||50||I still can't believe there is such a large park in central London. You can always something you can do here: ride a bicycle, ride your skates, play outdoor sports, take a walk or just lay under the sun (yes there is such thing as sunny day in uk :).You can feed the birds, or the squirrels also.||August 20, 2016
Amelia H||50||In most months this place is beautiful and smart. It if often described as pleasant and tourists wander round. My favourite time to visit though is in the winter months when they create a winter wonderland with an amusement park. The atmosphere is enough to make my grumpy father feel like Santa Clause and there are rides of every variety for everyone. Please don't miss it but be prepared to spend a lot of money.||August 20, 2016
emmie t||50||I came her with my mum a while back and we really enjoyed are time walking around and just relaxing. The place is clean and it is very easy to get to by public transport.A great place to go for a bike ride, football or just to relax.||August 20, 2016
tomdB2732IJ||50||This is a beautiful huge park. It has so much variety. From narrow trails through the grass to wide paved and graveled trails it is great for walking and running. It also has fields for football and water features for boating and viewing. Kensington Palace is at to the far west end. ||August 20, 2016
Daver08||50||Sun was out, thousands of people in the park. Long queues at boating lake at Serpentine, but a nice walk from Hyde Park Station to Lancaster Gate. Lots of wildlife,swans, ducks, geese, a heron, squirels and a lot more. Italien Garden is impresive. Well worth a visit.||August 19, 2016
960willemk||40||This park is just MASSIVE. I thought I had seen it all, when I discovered I had just walked a circle. I particularly liked the Christmas markets (and ice skating rink) in December, and of course to bring a football and play with it.||August 19, 2016
Proc10||40||Very clean and busy with loads of ppl catching the Rays an loads of dog walkers . Only bad note there was lot of dog poo in one part of the park||August 19, 2016
R647LSkarenh||50||Everytime we visit London we go to Hyde Park. There are parks for the children to play on and cafes to get refreshments. It is a lovely place to walk around with little gardens and water fountains, highly maintained with beautiful flowers.During our visit they had deck chairs to sit on and enjoy the sunshine, lots of people having picnics around.Very beautiful place to visit if in London.||August 19, 2016

gurdeepmudher||50||Hyde park is the nice place and its very peaceful. Visitors and locals enjoy there and have fun with kids.||August 18, 2016
Boho R||50||A must visit park in London which is considered the heart beat of London. Huge in size; packed with entertainment, cafe kiosks and even boating area. There are clubs organised where people will be engaging in some kind of activity, i.e. dancing salsa club. There is also a lake you can feed the birds. A huge park which means you need to be equipped with lots of bread to feed the birds and secure yourself a nice seating. Make sure you get yourself a blanket for a picnic. ||August 18, 2016
Kathleen B||50||Hyde Park is vast and picture perfect. During our mid-July visit we walked along the path which runs parallel to Bayswater Rd from one end to the other, stopped for a coffee at a lovely coffee shop along the way and admired the fountains. We also walked in and around the area of Kensington Palace.Even the in the middle of the summer, the park was very peaceful. Lots to explore. Many places to sit and relax. Whether you're an avid walker and want to cover lots of ground, or need to rest a bit more often, this is a perfect spot!||August 18, 2016
chanapai2015||50||Rent the bike for just £2 for 24hour! And ride around the park when it's sunny. Even tho you don't use it for 24hrs it still worth it. Then reward yourself with soft ice from the van!||August 18, 2016
frankpo1946||50||I am 70. Went for a stroll from Kensington/Knightsbridge. Got so absorbed with dogs and nature had to take a taxi back to hotel. Driver was kind and solicitous.||August 18, 2016

A real gem||August 17, 2016
1964MH||50||Always a joy visiting this park especially in the summer. So much going on there as look out for concerts in the summer. Being in central London it's nice just to leave the day to day hustle of city life and relax in a beautiful park. ||August 17, 2016
I432RXrichardb||30||I like Hyde Park - it's large, lots of space - a green heart in middle of LondonBut despite lots of signs giving pedestrians priority the cyclists are maniacs - either trying to emulate Olympics, or too busy on their phones||August 17, 2016

Bikes to hire, wildlife to see, iconic fountains, including Diana's fountain - make sure you go and have a paddle in the water, Palaces, monuments and then the serpentine lake...full of activity surrounded by 'take your pick' of picnic areas - just sit anywhere and take in what's going on around you. What a superb place visit.||August 17, 2016
Dimos63||50||It was the most relaxing moment of our trip.Sunny day,Sunday,we sat unter the trees in the ground took family photos and RELAX in the midst of London.Must DO experience.We also ate burgers in the restaurant by the Serpadine lake.||August 17, 2016
KayleighMac||40||It's a nice quiet park towards the Bayswater end. Quiet in central London is almost unheard of so it was nice to get some peace even for a moment. I like the layout and it feels safe here. I also like the fact you can be just moments from the hustle and bustle once you are done. ||August 17, 2016
Ladyfreegate||50||A daily walk through the park was the perfect way to start or end the adventures. Numerous paths cross-cross and lead through calming landscaping, past ponds and cafes within the park. Statues and fountains abound.||August 17, 2016

Emily P||30||I must admit, I was never impressed with Hyde Park. It is big, green open space with some parts where it looks like the woods and a nice huge lake good for a sunny afternoon to soak up the sun....But nothing spectacular. ||August 17, 2016
F9349JOsarahe||40||Walked through park whilst visiting London, was so clean, tidy and well maintained. Felt very safe with alot of people around. Would have spentMore time admiring the beauty had we had more time. ||August 17, 2016

GwenM620||50||We throughly enjoyed strolling through Hype Park daily. Very well manicured airy expanse of park with plenty of room to roam. Nice break from the crowds and hectic daily tours. Took advantage of this park daily to reflect on London.||August 16, 2016

M M||50||If you are visiting to London, make sure you stop off at hyde park, its located in the middle of london and is always buzzing with people. The serpentine is beautiful in the summer, where you can rent pedal boats or rowing boats which is a fun activity especially when the sun is shining! ||August 16, 2016

tooareist||40||We were lucky enough to stay at the mandarin Oriental so this park was in our "backyard'. It is a large and beautiful open space. There is lots to see and do. There is a great restaurant near the Serpentine. We rented peddle boats and spent an hour on the water. It was lovely and a nice reprieve from all of the museums.||August 16, 2016

leadyb||40||Hyde park is a great place to spend a few hours on a rainy day in London. You can hire deck chairs for £2 an hour, there are pedalos to hire on the lake, a few little cafes and plenty of open space to play in or simply just sit and people watch.The place is clean and easily accessible, very central and is free entry so it is a fantastic way to split the day up without spending a fortune in central London.||August 16, 2016

First thought was that the language from one particular 'orator' was a little bit ripe to say the least! OK, we're adults, but there were many children present, certainly within earshot, and these comments were extremely OTT particularly on a Sunday morning! We then strolled down toward the Serpentine. What's happened to the grass? It looked like it was dying there were many,many bare patches and it certainly wasn't verdant. I appreciate it's the middle of 'summer' but I was unaware we are in a drought situation. During the amble we were obliged to avoid several cyclists on this path where clearly there are signs "No Cycling". No policing either. There also is a distinct lack of Public Conveniences. The one we did locate, with queues, particularly the unfortunate 'Ladies', required a 20p payment. So many people don't carry cash these days........this needs a wee bit of consideration please.||August 16, 2016
SH61970||40||Enjoyed my visit to Hyde Park. In the centre is The Serpentine, a lake and bars and a restaurant. Lots of seating on picnic benches so although a really busy day there was to to sit. Great atmosphere. ||August 15, 2016
ashrafa23||40||Brilliant walk along the lake and the serpentine stopping at cafes along the way and just people watching would make a perfect afternoon, weather permitting :) ||August 15, 2016
Paxwell P||50||We had a good experience in the beautiful and magnificent park. My kids had been there before and this time we visited it specifically for the boat ride in the lake.||August 15, 2016

HGKCFP||50||This is London's Central Park facing Buckingham Palace. Don't miss "Speaker's Corner" and the amazing lineup of concerts in the park. Sometimes they are even FREE!||August 14, 2016
Nan2cute4u||50||We cruised around this huge park on the "Hop on Hop off" tour bus and it was just a beautiful place for many people to rest, relax, enjoy a bite of food, and for many, to "sun bathe!" ||August 14, 2016
Ilias_t_t||40||... and if not raining or snowing go ! You can stay there with friends, eat, drink and have fun chatting ( not online of course :P ) Not dirty, so you can stay !||August 14, 2016
JoeB4469||40||Lovely park, but to really get the most out of rent some skates from slickwillies.co.uk(Gloucester Road)Cheap and a great laugh.||August 14, 2016
wetherbyjim||40||One of Londons premier parks. Lots going on. A huge boating lake is very popular. Lots of eateries where you can sit outisde in good weather and chill out and watch the world go by. Lots of great wildlife especially birds. Quite a few sculptures also. On Sundats Psekers Corner operated on the North East corner of the park when anyone with a soap box and an opinion can preach to the world or anyone that wants to listen.||August 14, 2016
Chopper60||50||We went for a stroll around here in the sunshine, full of people but not crowded as it is a huge place. There is lots going on, people on boats, people rollerblading, people just chilling out. Its nice and convenient if you want to feel like youre not in a big City||August 14, 2016
BC_Tas||50||I am of the opinion that Hyde Park is the jewel in London's crown. It's expansive grounds are a treat to explore and it's great to see people out and about either walking, jogging and in some cases swimming! A must-see for any visitor to London.||August 14, 2016
LadyKylle||50||Our hotel was right next to Hyde Park. Our goal was to walk to the Hard Rock Cafe and our path took us right through the park. It was a lovely park! So green and lush. And even though its surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the city, the trees and size drowned out the noise and we enjoyed our walk more than if we had been on busy streets as we thought. Hyde Park was a pleasant, welcome and beautiful surprise.Visited August 2009||August 14, 2016
36Debbie||50||This is a huge area of parkland. The kids could run around and spent hours climbing the trees and swinging from branches and it's free.||August 14, 2016
Kate_4620||40||We rented bicycles for 2 pounds to cycle the park. In 90 minutes we covered all of Hyde Park as well as Kensington. The park is beautiful with many bike paths as well as pedestrian only paths. There is also a large lake with pedal boats available for rent. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. The only downside for us is how busy the park is. Pedestrians were walking all over the bike paths which made riding a bit tricky.Would highly recommend the park and the bike rentals. Well worth a visit.||August 13, 2016
401beccys||50||We spent a lovely afternoon walking around Hyde park. It's just beautiful. So much wildlife and the serpentine lake. There are cafes and you can hire a pedalo. We walked a lot of the way round through the Princess Diana memorial garden and had a picnic watching the world go by.||August 13, 2016
Shelle65||40||My Hubbie and I walked around this park twice whilst on vacation. It's so big and great to stretch your legs. There is so many beautiful trees, plants and flowers to capture great beauty and photos. It has the beautiful Serpentine Lake where there lots of birds and swans. You can hire bikes to ride around. The first 30 minutes is free. It also has the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. Lots of people walking, jogging, riding bikes and walking dogs everywhere||August 13, 2016
Ozgur C||50||perfect place to escape from the crowd and watch the beautiful swans. Perfect place for jogging or cardio walk.||August 13, 2016
loppylouni||40||Lovely peaceful gardens. It was lovely for a walk as well as sitting having a cup a coffee watching the world go by. You wouldn't believe you where in the middle of a major city ||August 13, 2016
natashat230||50||We walked through the park there seemed to be a few things to do for children feed the ducks and swans, peddle boats. Only thing watch if you walk where cyclist are there is bits they can't go in so that's good as well ||August 12, 2016
AlessiaMora||50||Hyde Park is the most beautiful park in London (with Regent's Park). There is a lake inside it called the "Serpentine Lake" where you can rent a pedalo boat for half an hour or an hour or more... Ducks, gooses are everywhere and this makes the place so unforgettable and unique. The grass is so looked after... You can sit down in the beach chairs and just relax and enjoy your time in London! It is also really nice to walk throughout the park and explore its hidden and exceptional places, flowers, animals... ||August 12, 2016
denisepol||50||Beautiful spot to watch the world go by. Lots of places to it food and drinks with deck chairs to hire at very reasonable prices. ||August 12, 2016

pookiefatcat||50||There is a lot to see here with different statues, memorials and gardens, there is also the Lido and pedalos (which I think are ridiculously expensive) It is such a lovely place to have a walk, a cuppa or a sit down!||August 12, 2016
777brewster||50||stopped of here with my wife and was amazed at how tranquil and beautiful it was wish we could have stayed longer||August 12, 2016
planestrainsandaut2s||50||We were fortunate to be in London and have a free day when it was sunny and warm, so we decided to venture through Hyde Park. We started at the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, which was an inexplicably profound experience. We got to see lots of roses and other beautiful flowers. We got to see swans and ducks, and wandered along wide paths under weeping willows and other beautiful trees. We also stopped at a cafe and got coffees to carry with us through the park. We ended our walk on the opposite side of Hyde Park, at the famous Speakers Corner. It was a lovely way to spend the afternoon, and it took less than 2 hours to walk the length of the park. The only downside is that if you want to stop and sit by the water, they RENT the chairs (I would like to point out that in Paris, the chairs in the gardens are free!)||August 11, 2016
MariaShec||40||The park is vast and requires energy to enjoy. The swans and geese were neat to watch as people fed them popcorn and other treats to their liking.||August 11, 2016
chickandbeast||50||Very large attractive greenspace with lots of foot traffic, we actually walked the entire perimeter. ||August 11, 2016
ChuckSid||40||We joined the park at Speaker's corner although there was no one speaking at the time. It was a hot Saturday afternoon and there were plenty of people in the park sunbathing or picnicking. We went down to the Serpentine and there were plenty of places to eat, have an ice cream or get a drink. We went around the other side and there was a pool for kids to swim and also an area where people can swim in the lake. We visited the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain which was heaving as loads of people were paddling, she would have loved to have seen everyone enjoying themselves on a hot day. ||August 11, 2016
maximillianom2017||40||If you like to spend some time on a walk or biking, see some attractions (check its calendar)Huuuuge park, you can go for a walk, bike, scooter ride, just endless ||August 11, 2016
RedTent1701||50||My husband and I ran 5 miles in Hyde Park one evening and it was fabulous. We loved getting a bit of exercise into our trip in such an enjoyable way. We passed Marble Arch, the Old Police House, the Italian Gardens, the Peter Pan statue, Round Lake, Kensington Palace, the Albert Memorial, the Princess Diana Memorial (slowed to a walk here to get the most enjoyment), and Flower Walk. It made for a very enjoyable evening and I will definitely do it again if I ever find myself back in London.||August 11, 2016
victoriasL5939DF||50||Such Beautiful Gardens and Open Spaces. We strolled through here several times. LOVED all the dogs. LOTS of dogs. So pretty. great place to take some time to just walk around and relax.||August 11, 2016
emilysJ92LS||50||A gorgeous Park and it's so big it isn't crowded. I'd recommend having a look at the history of the park or that you go on one of the ghost tours as it will give you a completely different perspective. ||August 11, 2016
tremopoulou||40||Yoy have to vitit Hyde Park!!!We had a nice walk around the park on our w stay.If i stay in London ,i will visit every day ,just to walk and breath fresh air.||August 11, 2016
Sweden33||50||After many many holiday trips to London, we always find something new to see and explore.In june 2016 we for the first time saw the Rose Garden in Hyde Park.It is located in the south east corner of the park, and it was the best, please check out the pictures.||August 11, 2016
MaGrFa||40||Nice place to get away from the city, very nice and peaceful and very beautiful especially on a fine day. On a fine day also very nice down by the serpentine||August 11, 2016
Ninboo||50||Have visited Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park twice recently (kids choice) and have to say it is fabulous. I never realised the park was so big and that there was so much to do. We started Kensington Palace end (off High Street Kensington next to the Royal Garden Hotel). Kensington Palace is right there which is great to visit, no queues, has a lovely café and has toilets. We then walked through the park past the round pond down to the Serpentine and then stopped at the Diana Memorial Fountains, the Lido Café then round to the Boat House and hired a Pedalo (bit pricey at £24 for 1/2 hour for family of 4) but was still great. We then walked down to Hyde Park corner cover the whole park from one end to the other. On our second visit I took my Mum who is disabled. I called Liberty Drives and they collected us in a golf buggy from the entrance on the Broadwalk off High Street Kensington and rove us all around the park seeing everything from the Peter Pan playground to the Albert Memorial and the Serpentine Gallery and dropped us off at the Memorial fountains after touring for over an hour and a half. We then walked for a bit before we left the park. Cannot recommend Liberty Drives enough. Makes such a huge park so easily accessible to disabled. Well done Liberty Drives.||August 11, 2016
Tom E||40||Whether using it to get to your next destination or taking some time out from sight seeing Hyde Park is a great place to spend some time when in London.It is also a fantastic venue for live music!||August 11, 2016
ShefKhanna||40||Great place to be early morning for a walk run or even yoga The best part is that it's so clean and well maintained Would highly recommend a visit||August 11, 2016
Jules H||50||This park is big and impressive, places to stroll, jog, picnic, watch the birds, visit the Serpentine Gallery. It nudges on Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace, so plenty to see and do.||August 11, 2016
Jedlynny||50||It was a joy to go into Hyde park and sit on the benches quietly reading. then being able to stroll along the pathways looking at the trees and flowers. A truly lovely park.||August 10, 2016
John H||40||My wife and I spent a few hours touring Hyde Park in June of 2016.They were setting up for the London Summer Music Festival near where we entered. We had taken the tube to the Marble Gate stop. We walked through the park, passing a large group of Swedes who were celebrating something, tons of flags and folks wearing flower crowns. Then we grabbed a bench and had a picnic lunch while people watching and enjoying the wonderful summer weather. Eventually we wandered over to Kensington Gardens and Palace and along the Serpentine lake. Stopping at the Albert Memorial, which is truly a MUST see in the park. Then on to the Princess Diana children's water park, where we relaxed in the shade and read our books for awhile. A very pleasant urban park to spend the day at!||August 10, 2016
travelnsouth||50||This park is very large and you can walk along the paths or just throw out a blanket and chill. Have lunch or a Ice Cream with Flakes! See the swans and ducks along the way. ||August 10, 2016
WispyFairyWings||30||We visited here for the Winter Wonderland. Unfortunately, it was raining throughout the whole day and there was very little cover to be found and no sort of provision of drying services. The food options were brilliant though and there was a good range of stalls that were offering games to win prizes and stalls selling miscellaneous Christmas items. We also went on the Ferris/eye wheel and we visited the Circus, both were really good and I recommend them both. We did book our tickets in advance online though as I believe that they sell out so make sure that you do this and don't miss out!I suppose the worst bit was that it was crazy expensive considering they had not prepared for rain and there was very little seating, but it is London and it was still a great day out with my Mum =)||August 10, 2016
Revieweress||50||Absolutely beautiful. Very well maintained. Great walk around on a hot summers day. The lake and boat hire is worth doing. Very easy to take a picnic along and have a picnic. Clean and little free in most areas. Gets very busy on hot days ||August 10, 2016
traveller20151005||50||Buy some duck food inside Hyde Park (or bring some bread). Feed the ducks, swans and pigeons by the lake or on it (boats can be hired at the boat house there). Happiness is guaranteed. Look around when you are there. Everyone is happy and no one is sad. I went there twice last week. My whole family loved every moment of both visits. Oh, and it's free to enter the park!||August 10, 2016
XSki007||40||Fun place for a quiet walk.I love to take a lunch from Harrod's and come sit on a bench and watch the locals and tourists.Even in my suit and tie!! ||August 10, 2016
Katherine M||50||We stayed in Kensington and either walked, jogged or cycled to this park nearly every day. I ran in the park because it is lovely and huge -- you can run whatever distance you like because there are so many routes and it's a large park. We also rented the Santander bikes from the Hyde Park station. There are plenty of paths you can cycle on too. Beautiful lakes and gardens. Wonderful getaway from the busy streets of London!||August 10, 2016
John K||40||Living in London for over 30 years one sometimes forgets about the treasurers. Spent a pleasurable two hours with my youngest son walking around Hyde park. Went to the Diana memorial fountain, around the serpentine and across to Marble Arch. When visiting London do not miss out on this green oasis.||August 10, 2016
PaulL225||40||We had a nice walk around the park on our weekend stay, the sun was shining and we sat for about an hour just people watching.||August 10, 2016
186338MichaelM||50||Well, I have lived in London almost all my 60 years, but this was the first time I had gone to Hyde Park. I just never thought about it! I assumed it would be too small, too crowded and too plain. I was very surprised. We had a big walk around part of it - maybe we will go back and finish it. The rose gardens and cafes tempted us and we enjoyed our drink and snacks too long!It was busy (it was a hot sunny Sunday) but there is enough of the park to walk away from the crowds. There's something for most - pond and boating - if that's what you want, cafes and snacks and larger areas either grass or areas with trees. Its nice that they have let some areas of the grass grow more.And even some unusual (and apparently famous) architecture and art installations. Like I said something for most people to enjoy a relaxing morning or afternoon.||August 10, 2016
Hamdanbinrashed||50||It's a lovely park to have a walk and enjoy the placeAlso great to do exercise early morning and grab a cup of tea with the lovely weather down there Recommend to those romantic couples who love to share a little chat while having a walk around ||August 10, 2016
vikkijg||50||Loved Hyde park this week. Temperatures reaching 25 degrees Celsius ad everyone is out in shorts and singlets. The deck chairs (£1.60 per hour) were displaying a bright array of sun lovers and the cakes were packed with holiday makers and visitors form England and abroad. Princess Diana's fountain was providing delight for hundreds of children and parents alike. A wonderfUl place for a pinch of delight.||August 9, 2016
crystabel||40||Lots of delightful areas such as the Serpentine lake, the Princess Diana children's play area, the Palace and its gardens, the Italain gardens. Only down side was the enormous amount of walking involved with an elderly lady and 2 small children. There was no "buggy" that day. Would be useful to have a paid buggy service (rather than relying on volunteers) to take people around the main attractions of the whole park.||August 9, 2016
amiprts||50||On Sunday we rented bicycles at the entrance to a position which is closest to Marble Arch. We walked around the park, the park lovely and full of adults, children and families. The garden in memory of Princess Diana is very charming.In Speaker's Corner was a large crowd around a number of speakers. It was very interesting to listen to the conversations between speakers.We spent several hours in the park without getting bored for a minute||August 9, 2016
ChartreuseBuzzard||50||We thoroughly enjoyed walking through this beautiful park adjacent to Buckingham Palace and resting on one of their many benches. It is charming to have parks throughout a city, as London does, and even better to see how much they are used by both residents and tourists. This one is adjacent to Buckingham Palace and its gardens, and one can occasionally catch a glimpse through the fences and hedges at the flowers. Take some time to enjoy nature in the middle of London. ||August 9, 2016
nolscam||50||I've been to Hyde Park a lot since I moved to London two years ago but last week was the first time I cycled around it. The park itself is really big and there's lots to see and do including taking pedal boats into the lake. They also host different events at Hyde park including the Barclays summertime festival which is always a great event! ||August 9, 2016
Eidalmansouri||50||Beautifully landscaped park! We enjoyed feeding the ducks and looking for squirrels! Lovely for young children to run around and waste a few hours in London without spending money.||August 9, 2016
855katelynd||50||It's a busy place even on a weekday in the summer. Personally I still found it relaxing and enjoyable. After a quick picnic by the river I got to enjoy a quick nap in tinge grass.||August 9, 2016
uday s||50||Such a breather in a lively city. I wish such gardens exist in every city. Lovely place to spend a peaceful evening watching the birds.||August 9, 2016
lavender470||50||A huge park in central London. So many different areas to walk to. Close to the other parks such as Green Park and Kensington Gardens.A walk through Hyde Park is such a wonderful experience. Peaceful yet in the middle of a great city. Back to nature with all the trees, plants, grass, water, wildlife. Last time I was there we saw parrots in the trees, squirrels tamely just wandering around, lots of birdlife.Lots to see and do. Well worth spending a few hours here.||August 8, 2016
Alski84||50||I took a walk through Hyde Park whilst waiting for clients. It's always such a wonderful place to visit. The mix of cultures all taking in the vast expanse of green found in central London. The serpentine is beautiful and it was a hot day but I didn't attempt to dive in although I was tempted! I look forward to my next visit to London for another walk around. ||August 8, 2016
ccs_cat||50||A pretty big park with a lot of nature. great place If you need a time to relax and chill surrounded by nature in busy London.||August 8, 2016
dpuck1998||50||We happened upon the park on a walk to Harrods, we ended up spending an hour or more exploring and walking around. Beautiful park and another place I hope to spend more time in one day.||August 8, 2016
Sylvain_Geneve||50||Beautiful park. Can be crossed in 20-30 minutes, or visited the all day. Some nice bars, and a great Lido and terrace by the Serpentine. The art galleries are worth visiting. Lots of birds (including a local species of parrots) and squirrels. The park is so huge that quite all the surroundings are nice (especially South Kensington, Exhibition Road and its museums, Knightsbridge, Notting Hill, Marble Arch, Green Park) ||August 8, 2016
SunilNambiar||40||A walk through Hyde Park is such a peaceful experience; it's vastness is mind blowing and so is it's neatness. It's hard to imagine that such greenery and wide spaces exist right in the heart of London, just a stone's throw away from Oxford street and other prominent city landmarks. We cut through the park to go from Sussex Gardens to Oxford street - and what a lovely experience it turned out to be!||August 8, 2016
X1105XOashleya||40||I first visited Hyde Park back in 1968 on my very first visit to the UK as a young boy. Several visits and walks in the park over the years.Yesterday, with time to spare before going to Wembley for the Community Shield season opener, I took the tube to Marble Arch and briefly visited Hyde Park. A sunny but hot day so I decided to adjourn to the nearby Cumberland Hotel.....Hyde Park including the iconic Speakers Corner is a must see for all tourists and visitors to London.||August 7, 2016
258saabb||50||For the last few weeks I have been regularly visiting Hyde Park on a Sunday. The weather has been nice which adds to its beauty.Why Sunday? - lots of free parking on a Sunday you can park on single yellow lines (always check the signs) and a lot of residient permit bays which most are free from sat 6.30 - Monday morning.The park itself has a lovely lido where you can hire boats, have a coffee or just people watch. If you wish to hire bikes you can cycle, If you prefer to run there are plenty of others so you don't feel self conscious.All in all a wonder free day out with a lovely atmosphere.||August 7, 2016
gabigib||50||The view is simply fantastic and everything around is so serene. There are ducks walking around here and there and everyone looks a lot more peaceful.||August 7, 2016
goddessbabs||50||A great place to enjoy a good walk around the serpentine go boating and enjoy good burgers and pizzas. The park offers cycle hire and is well equipped with excellent toilet facilities and several restaurant/coffee shops as well as kiosks. ||August 7, 2016
Spithead||40||Walked from Bayswater across to Park Lane and was amazed to see how they have allowed areas to grow more naturally instead of all manicured lawns. Looks bush like in places.The SERPS as always was sparkling and the location of Boris bikes enables you to cover great areas of this giant park and swop as you ride.Shade from 100 year old trees makes this a magnificent park a pleasure to picnic.||August 7, 2016
CaroSouthAfrica||50||I love coming here and try to visit every time I visit London. It changes seasonally, on Thursday parts of it reminded me of Africa, the sun was beating down and the grass had been left to grow a bit wild! I was keen to show off my 'bike hire skills" to a friend but unfortunately the machine opposite Queensway wasn't working. So walk it was, and it was hot and lovely. Nice to cool down under the shady trees and just watch the world go by.||August 7, 2016
VieK1||50||we love hyde park, kids can do duck feeding at the lake. It's a huge park, kids have plenty of space to run around.||August 7, 2016
Helen K||40||We had a picnic here recently, and the children enjoyed the Diana water memorial. There are fascinating water fowl on the lake, including black swans, and the area is large enough to suit everyone, including boating and walking. Keep an eye out for the wild naturalised parakeets.||August 7, 2016

meddy2472||50||I recently spent a lovely summer afternoon in Hyde park with my young daughters. We visited the cafe for food, which was tasty although a little expensive, then played frisbee on the large open field area. There are boats to hire on the serpentine, and lots of areas to explore.||August 7, 2016
cassandrab082||50||Was so lucky to get a beautiful sunny day in London when I visited Hyde Park. I enjoyed walking and riding around the grounds of this beautiful park and taking it all in! You truly forget that you are in the middle of a busy city as its so quiet and peaceful there, and the grounds are kept so beautifully as well, it's picture perfect and makes for some good photography! Visited the Princess Diana memorial fountain as well and sat and paddled my feet in the pool. Really great day spent exploring! ||August 7, 2016
Juliet T||40||Beautiful peaceful park . Took a huge scarf and slept for a while .lots to view . Queues at the cafe near Hyde park underground aren't too bad ether .The squirrels are amazingly tame . I watched them run up people's legs to be fed nuts . So cute to watch .||August 6, 2016
marciabarham||40||Hyde Park is huge so a stroll can turn into a very long walk. We enjoyed people watching through the park. With a GPS on our phones it was easy to find our way over to Harrods for a wee nosey.||August 6, 2016

EJRover||40||Great place to relax and unwind. There is a little coffee shop/cafe near the Diana memorial that is quite nice. The Italian Garden is gorgeous! But the most fun is feeding the parrots near the Peter Pan memorial. They will come and land on your arm. So fun!||August 6, 2016
554nickt||40||On a recent visit to London we had some time before our restaurant booking so decided to take a walk through Hyde Park and what a difference from our last visit which was to see a concert! Total relaxation comes to mind yes it was a sunny day which I am sure makes all the difference but just take in the scenery the people watching and the beautifully maintained gardens etc and forget you are in a busy metropolis for an hour!||August 5, 2016

shivanikagti||50||We were staying in a hotel which was less than 10 minutes walking distance from the park. The entry nearest to us was from the Lancaster gate underground station. Went there once in the morning around 8 am. The Italian gardens (built by king Albert for queen Victoria) is a really beautifully done up space with a pond and fountains. But I particularly enjoyed walking through the park, along the lake, and watching people walk their dogs and do yoga...It's serene and beautiful. We walked down to the waterside where all the water fowl gather. I could have easily spent my day here watching the different types of birds and an occasional runaway dog that would chase the birds into the water. If you have the time, I would suggest carrying a picnic lunch into the park. There's a small cafe too near the Italian gardens But we didn't have time to go there. ||August 5, 2016
Madeleine S||50||Twice I have used their services and I just turned up and they took myself and my 91 year old mother for a lovely tour on their mobility buggy round Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. You do not have to pay but give something if you can. Two fantastic parks right in the centre of London. Beautiful gardens, lakes, statues, houses. A really nice volunteer took us round. What more can life offer. I highly recommend this for someone with an elderly mother. If you have a Blue Badge you can park right by their venue.||August 5, 2016
JaimeGarcia94||30||It's actually a nice and large park, with the Serpentine and its birds being very cute, but it's not for those who get easily bored.||August 5, 2016
JGW33782||50||We did a Sunday stroll through the park. Even though there were a lot of people, we didn't feel crowded. Lovely gardens, water areas, grassy areas. Family friendly, too. A few recreational activities but mostly go to enjoy the peace and quiet.||August 4, 2016
kerikid23||50||After visiting Harrod's (and purchasing chocolate bars), my sister and I made our way to Hyde Park. We meandered through some of the park and noticed that it was one of those rare sunny days in London and the Londoners were out in full force enjoying the weather! We sat on a bench and people watched for a bit while we ate our scrumptious Harrod's chocolate bars. We started walking around some and decided that we would cover more ground and see most of the park if we rented bikes. I am so glad we made this decision! We got a little lost but had a grand time in the process! WE made some great memories at Hyde Park.||August 4, 2016
Kabir B||50||it was great to take the kids to feed the ducks and go on the merry go round. the large space let them run around and be safe. there is a lot to do there, but advice is plan to where you want to go as the park is very large. ||August 4, 2016
CAJ64||40||I hired one of the Santander bikeshare bikes to ride through Hyde Park on a drizzly afternoon, and it was very enjoyable. The only disappointing thing was that I had looked at a map of the park on the internet and it didn't clearly show which pathways were not accessible to bikes, of which there were many I found when I was actually riding.||August 4, 2016
Richard W||50||IMO its the Royal Parks that make London really stand out as a tourist destination. Beautifully maintained and calm, an ideal place to stroll and people watch||August 4, 2016
RyanG636||40||We visited here the second time for Barclays Summertime Presents Take That, the first time being Winter Wonderland the previous Christmas so we really saw two very different views of the park.You have to say the organisation of such events are just brilliant, though. The concert particularly, as crowded as it was fighting your way to get in, once it was in full swing you could really appreciate where you were.Even on the walk down before the concert the park is full from all angles - it's really nice to see people taking advantage of the space.||August 4, 2016
Mathieulomb||50||We loved the animals, the grass, and the ambiance of this huge park with my girlfriend during the hottest week of July.||August 4, 2016
petal39||50||Just lovely walking in Hyde Park, spotting squirrels, patting people dogs. Very rejuvenating from the hustle and bustle of this busy city.||August 3, 2016
TrailBlazer604497||50||Been to parks around the world. None beat Hyde park. It is awesome.Can spend whole day here if not rainy. We ate at the Serpentine. Their breakfast, entrees like fish and chips as well as pizza are yum. So is the icecream which the kids downed in a sec. There are games like scrabble available and activity pgs n pencils for kids.The boat ride is addictive and lounging on the deck chairs ( even though they cost per hour per person) is definitely recommended. If you plan ahead and go you may be able to see a live concert or performance. The winter wonderland here near Xmas is a sight n not to be missed.||August 3, 2016
susan33181||50||Walking through Hyde Park is truly an experience. Skateboards, bikes and walkers all share the many paths that intersect throughout the park. Nonetheless, the most interesting area to visit was Speakers Corner. Historically, this corner in Hyde Park, gives voice to many opinions and creates conversations from anyone willing to stand-up on their ladder or soap box. In fact, that's where the term, Soap Box, came from. Spend some time and enjoy the political rhetoric or civil complaints. ||August 3, 2016

Ann B||50||Visited in July in particular to visit the Peter Pan statue.The park is huge and you could spend hours there.Lots of modern art dotted around the park with lovely open spaces.At the top end is the Italian Gardens which were lovely to sit and relax in.||August 2, 2016
iUAE_Falcon||50||I just love taking a walk in this park. It just soothes your mind. Helps you think and enjoy the moment. Whethere it is sitting by the lake and enjoying the beautiful view and feeding the ducks or taking a stroll with friends or sipping a nice cup of tea or jogging or excercising, each have their own taste and fun.||August 2, 2016
NathalieZ51||40||We walked through Hyde Parc to join a Notting Hill brunch location. The walk seemed quite endless. The parc is huge. There is a very nice water area with boats. An inconvenience is the quasi absence of seating opportunities. ||August 2, 2016
Karolina S||50||Massive park! Go for a stroll, a bike ride, picnic or whatever you like. Lovely green space in London with ponds with ducks and children play areas. Can walk all the way to Princess Diana's house I believe it is.||August 2, 2016

Smorboll||50||A pretty big park with a lot of nature. You'll see birds, water, etc. as you walk through. London parks are a nice way to either see on your way to something or as an end to your day.||August 2, 2016
joefizz||50||Quite a noisy place as people follow their speaking passions, but as you move out into the open field, the hustle and bustle just stops.If you are at Oxford St or Marble Arch, go there with a picnic. great!||August 2, 2016
Ihabdalal||50||Go & relax there. Leave your kids play around & sit & enjoy the nature. Lots of activities can be done there, cycling, skateboarding, horse riding, play grounds.... Refreshments stations are available around the park with few restaurants. It is really a royal park in the heart of London ||August 2, 2016

blackpoodle2015||50||I spent half a day wandering Hyde Park with my 18 year old son, it was a delight, one of my best memories now. We went to both Serpentine Galleries, just the right size for an 18 year old, played with visitors dogs on the green, stopped for hot cocoa and coffee at the Serpentine Bar and Kitchen. Lovely||August 1, 2016
renato-sma||40||Hyde Park is a really vast and nice park in the city. If the weather is good, it is excellent to walk, make a pick-nick, or simply rest after a day of exploring the city.||August 1, 2016
charles16031958||40||Hyde park is above all a lovely green space in the middle of London where families, kids, teenagers, couples, and seniors walks and sits in an awesome green park environment. A must visit while residing in London or visiting this lovely city.||August 1, 2016

ballamerand||50||We walked into the park on a cloudy day but it was full of flowers and benches to relax on, well worth a break here after all the walking.||August 1, 2016
Neil O||40||As summer visitors to London we do not enjoy the natural experiences of the other seasons but in July and August the best time for us is as early as we are able to rise in the morning to walk and exercise in the tranquility of the park away from the noise and the crowds, not just of the streets of London but the picnic areas and boating activities of the Serpentine. It is a lovely oasis of serenity walking along the long quite boulevards or winding pathways engulfed by all those magnificent trees. It is one of rare moments of peace followed by a well earned breakfast in one of numerous local cafes surrounding the park before the onslaught of busy tourist trails later in the day.||July 31, 2016
readysetGO2||50||I was only there for about an hour but it was gorgeous when the sun was setting on the lake. The birds were entertaining to watch and the swans were pretty. Nice to lay in the grass under a tree and look up and relax. ||July 31, 2016
876ninas||50||What I love about London is all of their many parks. It's a great resting place for a visitor to grab a sandwich and "chill out" for a few hours. Especially the park by Buckingham palace. I can just imagine some young ladies in the 1800s with their petticoats and long dresses strolling along the park and twirling your parasols. I am so amazed how clean London is especially their parks!||July 31, 2016
BlackCatNyx||50||I particularly enjoyed the Princess Diana Fountain. It's not your normal fountain that many Americans are familiar with. There is no shooting water, but it is a very interactive and lovely place. Truly a unique "fountain" that you should see if you have a chance. The park is large with many paved walking paths.||July 31, 2016
farjouj||50||Very nice and vast park with many ponds and fountains as well as nice flowers! But their are not enough rubbish bins next to kendington palace.||July 31, 2016

magda-italy||50||Hyde Park is an oasis of peace in the middle of London. My son wanted to try a boat ride and we enjoyed it , although it was quite crowded and the lake is closed after the bridge. The price is per person and not per boat! Plenty of grass to relax (chairs are quite expensive).||July 31, 2016
theblacks257||40||Great park on a summers day. Plenty for the kids to do and it's a lovely place for a stroll. Had forgotten how nice it is!!!!||July 30, 2016
Bggl||50||Went to see the structures built in the park this sumer. Fantastic designs and wonderful works of art. A very enjoyable experience walking around and photographing them all. The cafe next to the Serpentine museum is in itself a masterful work of art in the curves of the roof and pillars and with service and food to match.||July 30, 2016

Carole G||50||It was beautiful weather so we walked though the park to get to Oxford Street. It was like being far away in the middle of nature, people enjoying sunbathing, just sitting on benches, jogging, enjoying the day. A wonderful place.||July 30, 2016
Kellykbhv||30||Just a stroll through the park.Although fairly clean, there is mostly sculptures and trees, not so many play areas, not so many flowers. Variance is lacking and there was not a great smell in the air when we walked through.||July 30, 2016
nick0002016||50||if you want to relax in London you must go to hyde park. I Always find a lot of Pokemons there and I have fun with My Friends Walking and running ||July 30, 2016
Asswag||50||It is well worth visiting this gigantic park. You can escape the traffic and chaos of London. Bring along your lunch and relax between assaults on the shopping streets. Great both for single people and families. Make sure you pick up the trash after you - to keep the park clean and wonderful. ||July 29, 2016
Mamajamma18||50||Depending on the time of the year your visit there is always so much to do in Hyde Park. We were there in the summer when there was a concert going on. Looking back I should have made arrangements to buy tickets way before we visited. We were able to sit outside of the gate and hear Take That in concert. ||July 29, 2016
Fran R||50||An absolutely lovely way to spend a day strolling through Hyde Park. So much to see, especially the little squirrels that seem to be all through the park. Something to see at anytime of the day especially the Royal Horseguards going through their paces in the morning which is a sight in itself. There's a lake in the middle which in summertime is filled with people using the paddle boats watched by people sitting in deck chairs enjoying the sun. There are two cafés in the park, both which are lovely as their positioning which enables you to enjoy a light meal with beautiful views of the lake.||July 29, 2016
Χριστιάνα Π||50||I think it is the first park that any tourist visit. It is in front of the most popular and noisy street of London so it is very nice to go for a walk inside to relax. It is very big and you can walk for a lot of time. It has a lake with a coffee shop, so it is nice to rest looking the view with the ducks. In the afternoon until night a lot of company's played games or have pick nick. In my opinion if you visit a lot of times London, if you are in the center you must go for a walk, otherwise London has most beautiful parks as Regent park, Holland park etc.||July 29, 2016
Gwandi||40||Hyde Park is a great place to walk through and/or to sit and watch the natives and tourists swarm by. Many beautiful gardens and historic spots where people have gathered through the years to express their minds on many matters. The numerous flower gardens are beautiful. ||July 29, 2016

Alex S||50||Its a lovely park with the serpentine in it where you can hire boats or go swimming in at the lido. We walked all the way around and had lunch at the café in the Italian Gardens.There are toilets spread throughout the park so you can spend some time here, however like all London toilets they do charge a small amount.||July 28, 2016
yellowpig||50||Wonderful place to visit & take a picnic. the part is the Diana Memorial Park, we call it the Peter Pan Park. You are only allowed in if you have children under the age of 15 with you.Magical place with so much for the kids to do. Giant pirate ship to climb, water features, sand, mini wig wams, food and drink.Wander around Hyde park and find the Peter Pan statue and the serpentine gallery, so much to do you could spend days there.

Aussie_Traveller08||50||Hyde Park is a beautiful place to stroll in the peacefulness amidst the busy city. Visit the Princess Diana fountain memorial and Kensington Palace. We also came across a display of modern sculptures on show in the park. Although it rained the day we visited, armed with a good umbrella, we still managed to enjoy a few hours exploring Hyde Park.||July 28, 2016

NormaN897||50||London is a wonderful city but sometimes it is too much. Hyde Park is an oasis. Beautiful flower gardens, wonderful boating lake and a great place for a picnic.||July 27, 2016
TheRealGigi||50||Great place to relax with your partner. Best to bring a packed lunch and beers in a cooler bag because everything is very pricey in the park. Which will allow you more money for activities such as the peddle boats.To fill in the day before the park - try Southbank food festival on a Saturday - loads of activities and entertainment to see by the London eye.||July 27, 2016
whitewitch_nj||50||Yet another piece of heaven in the middle of London. Great for a day out. Has playgrounds, some wildlife, a huge lake. The Princess Diana Memorial Fountain is also very beautiful.||July 27, 2016

ziggypiggypie||40||Did you know that you can ride horses in Hyde Park. You need to make reservations 6 months before you go. It is mostly walking and some trotting but it is still cool to ride through a few streets of London from the alley where the horses are stabled to get to Hyde Park.||July 27, 2016
alyonatopg||50||Wonderfully kept park, with activities, galleries, food stops along the way. Paddle boating is worth checking out. ||July 27, 2016

Liiihah||50||We went into the park on Sunday for a 'free' day of entertainment. We arrived to see a gathering of in line skaters who were preparing to go off together. They had music systems strapped to one or two of them and as they all set off it was a sight to behold. We then enjoyed a lie on the grass and dozed after a busy previous day. We then went off the find the Lido. Wow the bar and grill was heaving with patrons the BBQ smoke filled the air and beyond it was the water full of bobbing boats and pedalos. We decided to to hire s pedalo and paid £24 for 30mins.We had a fantastic time on the water and for a chilled yet entertaining afternoon that cost a lot less than other attractions we would definitely recommend a visit. We will be taking a picnic next time we go and I will be packing the wine as the tube takes us back n forth.||July 26, 2016
383grahams||50||From Diana's fountain to The Serpentine to the many paths through the park to the many adjacent attractions (Harrods, Science Museum, Park Lane it's a must visit ||July 26, 2016
pavilez||30||I took my kids (8 and 12 years) here, so that they could run around a bit, but since it was a nice day, the park was packed with people sitting down enjoying the beautiful weather. There wasn't a lot of space for them to run around without running over people. It is more of a teen and single persons hang out, rather than a family place. After we had left, we had heard that there was a stabbing there. I'm not sure if that's a regular occurrence or not. If you're looking for relax with kids/family, then go to the Kensington Garden side...that's where the families seem to go.||July 26, 2016
Ben K||30||massive park to visit - lots going on all the time for tourists - particularly like the winder market||July 26, 2016
emmlouisec||40||A beautiful, clean park that can be enjoyed by all ages. A calm setting, even with a lot going on. Very relaxing. We went on the paddle boats whilst there. The cue seemed very long when arriving but this soon goes down, don't be put off by it. It's £12 per person for 1 hour, well worth the money and time. There are also rowing boats available.There are toilets, a cafe and plenty to do. I'd definitely return, and I'd definitely recommend going.||July 26, 2016
1patriciob||50||We travel a lot to Great Britain and one of the palaces we love to rush to on a sunny day is Hyde Park.

My favourite in London||July 26, 2016

bryano755||50||A park like no other, this park is a must go for tourist visiting London. Took a lovely stroll in the park entering from the entrance closer to the Royal Horse Guard from Whitehall. Good place to enjoy the company of so many species of birds, pigeon, pelicans, mandarin ducks, swans and more. Beware of bring food as birds may swam to you. Not recommended for those who are afraid of close proximity with birds.||July 25, 2016
elise1997||40||My friend and I stayed in London for four days, and our trip to Hyde Park is definitely one of my best memories. We rented bikes to get there, and parked them just outside the park. I think it's also possible to use bikes in some areas in the park, but we parked them outside just to be sure. Then we walked around the park and visited the Peter Pan statue and the speakers corner, which we both enjoyed. Then we bought lunch at the benugo(?) cafe and had a picnic in the park. It was a great atmosphere with enough people to not feel lonely, and little enough to not feel like it was overcrowded. After our lunch we rented a boat for and hour and saw the park from a different perspective. I imagine this being a fun activity for anyone (families, couples, friends whatever). The only thing I would comment is that we found very few cafes/restaurants in the park. Benugo was very crowdy and it would have been good with some more options.||July 25, 2016

richard j||50||walking along the lake in Hyde Park after picking up a sandwich or drink is as good as London has to offer regarding peacefulness, its not quite a cornish beech, but its a great way to spend a sunday||July 25, 2016
PauPintoAraya||40||A huge park, where you can stroll or bike around. If you get to the lake you can even rent a boat! It is a nice place for a family to have a stroll.||July 25, 2016
Africansi||50||One of Londons best open spaces. You can walk from Hyde Park into Kensington Gardens past the Serpentine. Make sure you pay a visit to the Italian sunken gardens as they are beautiful. If you must you can visit the Princess Diana memorial but it always makes me feel let down. And Hyde Park is great for getting a picnic together and just sitting in the grass reading and relaxing.||July 25, 2016
RolandFG||40||Great park to go to and have a walk and ride a bike!! There are ducks and birds so you could feed them and have some time alone!!||July 25, 2016
Reasonable50||50||The Ring -neckrd parakeets have naturalized in the UK. There is an abundant flock residing in Hyde Park. I came up on many bird lovers holding out apples for the parakeets to nibble on. It was quite a sight. I have attached a photo. The location of this area is on the Kennsington side of of Serpentine Lake.||July 25, 2016
Kristin M||40||My family and I were vacationing in London during the heat wave in July. We decided to walk through Hyde Park on our way to the Tube after touring Kensington Palace. The Princess Diana Memorial Fountain was one of our stops in the park, and it was amazing to see all the people wading in the fountain with their families. We did the same, and it was so refreshing - a must-do! Our only constructive feedback is to add more bathrooms and places that sell water because the park is huge!!||July 25, 2016
Dons1977||50||Hottest day of the year, was nice to chill out and have a picnic in the park. Very busy but a friendly atmosphere (at that time!). Would avoid at night obviously.....||July 25, 2016
nathanm324||50||This park has lovely surroundings, making it the perfect place to go for a relaxing walk. Clean, tidy and has a nice atmosphere.||July 25, 2016
GSimone77||30||Hyde Park is a huge central London park. On it's far end you will find a large circular pond a few well manicured gardens and Kensington Palace. A nice lake in the center with paddle boats and a lively atmosphere. Many trails throughout and a nice way to spend an outdoor picnic with plenty of shaded options. If your looking for a romantic atmosphere with very well maintained gardens and pretty trails to walk through then go to Regent's Park it's a much better option. ||July 25, 2016
Alex H||50||We walked through Hyde Park from Alberts Memorial, to Diana's Fountain (its a waterway for kids to play in really - but this is great!) then on through to Diana's play area. Brilliant place to walk and chat, lots for children to do and see, very clean and organised. We had a coffee near the Carousel, considered lunch at the Orangery (pricey but pretty) and enjoyed the happy, relaxed ambience.I would go again, and plan to stay longer.||July 25, 2016
ZayerFaisal||30||Hyde park is a place to see different people and to spend good time with small children. A place to bicycle , jogging or simply walking . No way not to be there if you are in London .||July 25, 2016
FGG-DXB||30||Massive park with a nice lake. Most people can only visit a part of it. Seeing the whole park would require a few hours. The speakers corner is interesting. Overall, worth a quick visit.||July 24, 2016
974chantelll||50||I was walking Oxford St into Bayswater Rd to get to back to my hotel and got tired of hearing the police sirens, detoured by construction and getting my lefts and rights confused while crossing the streets, so I decided to cut through Hyde Park. Plus I've never went Hyde Parks in NYC nor Chicago during visits. London's Hyde Park was lovely and I enjoyed a peaceful walk to the hotel. Perfect trail to take a run or cycle. I sat on bench to relax more completely forgetting the road was on the other side. It was nice to see the different types of people laughing and having fun. There are lawn chairs provided and a cafe in the park as well. ||July 24, 2016
Brad208||50||I walked what seemed like the entire 350 acres of Hyde Park. The distance didn't matter due to the serene nature of the park and seeing families and groups of people enjoying activities together. The park was quite busy with joggers & bicyclists- so watch out! I'm amazed that Kensington Palace is right there on the western edge occupied by the Royal Family. What a beautiful palace. The sculptures placed throughout are amazing too. ||July 24, 2016
JimW551||50||My friend is not much of a runner or early riser, but I talked him into getting up and running through Hyde Park about 6:30 am. It is quiet, peaceful and there are few people to there. It is incredibly beautiful and well maintained. A pleasure eery time I get to jog here.||July 24, 2016
Malyyy919||50||It was a very good experience. We fed the ducks and went on paddle boats in the lake to enjoy the sunshine. Spending time in this park is very relaxing. You will never feel bored of going there everyday.||July 24, 2016
Explore84||50||i used to come here alot and always loved it! Must visit again soon i hope it hasnt changed too much! ||July 24, 2016
IanDig||40||Well worth a visit - the walk by the water was lovely and then we had a long slow stroll up through the park to Marble Arch. It is a huge park and there are loads of open space, plenty of shade and there are good facilities too - with a large cafe / restaurant near the Serpentine (although we didn't use it, it look very busy, so can't be too bad) Another great place for a family picnic, especially with the weather as it has been recently. There also appeared to be a swimming area, both pool and in the Serpentine - but we didn't visit and only saw the entrance. So loads to do.||July 24, 2016
elsworld||50||Enjoyed a picnic day in the hyde park. It's a lovely natural place in the middle of the big city....||July 24, 2016
Sternula||50||We visited twice, once on the bikes you can rent and once to go bird watching. On sunny days very crowded but lots to do. I prefered an overcast day, lots if neat walking trails.||July 24, 2016
madhu931||40||We visited the park and had a picnic with friends. The park is very well kept despite the size of it. Plenty of shaded places for people to sit and enjoy the gardens. Beautiful flowers all in full bloom at this time of the year. There are plenty of benches throughout the park with easy access for disabled people. A nice place chill in the heart of busy London ||July 24, 2016
JackiRT2014||50||So pretty - a very happening and FREE place with lots of signs and markers to tell you where you are and what is of interest where you are looking. Loads of locals hanging around too - very friendly. Great place for a morning run or walk or even swim. Also a life saver place to stop and decompress when the hustle bustle of London becomes too much. Don't miss it. ||July 24, 2016
Taxidevil||40||While strolling through Hyde park I was surprised to find a statue of Achilles and have since found out that this is a monument to Wellington and made from melted down cannons from battles.The park itself is wonderful on a hot day and is lovely to get away from the traffic.Watch out for joggers!||July 24, 2016
jon F||40||I think this is the kind of place that even in the pouring rain would be beautiful. It has rolling open spaces and paths that idle their way across the park. A great day out, even as a lone stroller I would say this is an enjoyable place. ||July 24, 2016
shuzhenk||40||We had a lovely picnic and the little one loves the water area and the playpark, good place to relax. Some bikini clad ladies were suntanning while a few burkha covered ladies were spending time having a picnic with their family. What an interesting contrast. Definitely plenty room to run and play for the little ones, so near to Knightsbridge station.||July 23, 2016
MariK888||50||What a beautiful park to walk or bike through. Morning is much more calm then after 5 PM, especially in the summer. There's a wonderful café called the serpentine café right on the lake and it is so terrific. Everything is homemade and there are so many choices. This is a must do while you are in London!!||July 23, 2016
cks1970||50||It was an extremely hot day and i decided to have an evening walk in this park after the museum visit. Despite its huge size of few hundred acres, you could still lots of visitors everywhere in this hot summer evening and most of them were enjoying the sunbath or relaxing near the lake. From their outlook, you know they were mainly Middle East and Asian tourists. I like Serpentine lake with the refreshing view and wildlifes & the noticeboard reminding people that it is an offence to harm wildlifes here. Kensington Park is just next to it and could be visited together (it is just too huge to walk for a lot of people).||July 23, 2016
Travel4sports||50||Had some of my most memorable runs in the morning here at Hyde Park in May. Weather was perfect and park was quiet. ||July 23, 2016
Cindy G||40||This park is quite large and contains some magnificent gardens, the ones you are used to seeing in books about English Gardens with all their splendor. Beautifully kept, it offers wonderful places for a quiet moment, tranquility for an extended break from busy every day life, places to picnic and enjoy the beauty of the park and lots of pretty open spaces!||July 23, 2016

Mike1720||40||We visited Hyde Park on a Black Cab Tour one day and went back for a picnic. We thoroughly enjoyed our day at HP. One note: You will see chairs around the park. They ARE NOT FREE. An attendant will come by and charge you 1lb.60p for the use. Not a budget buster but be aware. ||July 23, 2016
AttiqueAhmed||50||Take a stroll or try the pedal boats for a relaxed time when you want a break from London's ever-present energy||July 23, 2016
Tracy R||50||If you're at the Marble Arch end of Oxford St you should definitely cross the road and take a stroll through Hyde Park. At any time of the year it is a beautiful contrast to the bustle of the city. Walk under the trees, have an icecream by the Serpentine, feed the ducks, hire a boat or just walk through to get to Knightsbridge on the other side. You'll be surprised at how much better you will feel after a stroll in the park.||July 23, 2016
Pepi_Guido||50||Great place from romantic walk, children play, family outing, picnic or concert. During sunny day or the rain, always good to be there.||July 22, 2016
952cris||50||Hyde Park is a great place to relax and wander. There are volunteers on battery vehicles who will guide you on a tour, they generally just ask for a donation. It is very worthwhile getting the information. Almost a must||July 22, 2016
Maurice421||50||Great place to relax in the sun . Amazing to see so much wildlife in the middle of the city. If you're flying around the city do the tours this is the place to go for a break or a bite to eat to refresh your batteries ||July 22, 2016

sitcharliesit||50||There are so many things to do here that it's hard to get bored. If you're feeling active there are bike lameness, running paths, tennis courts. If you're wanting to chill, the grass is pretty welcoming. With or without a blanket, you'll find yourself taking your shoes off and relaxing. It's also a fun place to people watch. I liked visiting Kensington sunken garden as well as it was a peaceful place to just contemplate. All in all, good place. ||July 21, 2016
kapitman||50||A great walk...loved the Diana fountain memorial....There are lots of activities you can do in the park, too. ||July 21, 2016
miyapinion16||50||Big, green, serpentine gallery, memorials, space to run, see some bands, snooze, picnic and enjoy some greenery in central London. Like all London parks, pretty darn cool.||July 21, 2016
64leannej||50||I know that is a big statement but this park lives up to it . It would take a week to see it all the lakes ,the monuments ,the wildlife the fountains ,the gardens .Take the time stroll, ride a bike a must do for London I highly recommend it . ||July 21, 2016
EmmaJS23||50||We visited here whilst on a short visit to watch my daughter perform at the Albert Memorial. We were lucky and had beautiful weather. My daughter spent a good hour chasing grasshoppers through the long grass and the toilet facilities are immaculate. We visited the Peter Pan statue, the Albert Memorial, a couple of the cafes and couldn't fault our experience. We will definitely like to spend longer here next time. ||July 21, 2016
MummyMore||50||We went as a family to Hyde Park and we all enjoyed it. The kids loved the open space with freedom to go where they wanted, the birds (especially the large number of swans). The adults loved the green and the beautiful flowers and the way there are lots of paths to explore so it doesn't feel crowded. We also visit the Princess Diana Memorial Fountains and they were beautiful and the kids loved paddling around - make sure you take a change of clothes/swimming stuff as any kids WILL get wet :)We had some food at the cafe by the Lido - it was ok, relatively expensive but an easy option with tired kids.||July 21, 2016
Elise Å||40||A great place to sit down and enjoy people watching or lunch. The park is big so there's always a place for you to sit down..||July 21, 2016
BuckbeatsFeather||20||You can get almost anywhere from Hyde Park due its size. There is always lots to see and many runners. There will always be space for a picnic.||July 21, 2016
FitVixenJ||30||Noticed some on going road works during my 3-day visit and litters throughout the park. Seem overwhelming and challenging to upkeep the park in terms of cleanliness and botanical management. The lake area with the swans, ducks and birds was serene. ||July 21, 2016
Heather P||40||A wonderful park in the heart of Londons Westend It is full of trees to shade in, from out hot and sunny summer to the rain! There is a boating lake, a swimming pool and plenty of cafes. Of course there is the beautiful Princess Diana water feature and two art galleries, so it is well worth a visit. There is also a restaurant for a romantic meal overlooking the lake.||July 21, 2016
998julieh||50||My friend and I walked from the gate near Albert Hall, just before the Albert memorial, to Kensington palace. It is lovely with trees to offer shade and I only wish I'd plucked up the nerve to make use of the Santander bicycles. ||July 20, 2016

aer661||50||Hyde park was a dream! Something out of a movie! So much greenery, water ways and animals. The best part of walking through Hyde Park is kind of a secret....near the Peter Pan sculptor is an area full of wild green canaries that roam free in the trees. If you have appealing food to the birds, they will fly to your hands to eat. It was amazing! ||July 20, 2016
dabella2015||50||Go with comfortable shoes, it is huge and beautiful! Very peaceful even though there are so many people. There is some chairs around to sit down. Bathrooms are also available at the park. ||July 20, 2016

iloveholidays077||50||Spent my first afternoon here walking and cycling around to ward off jet lag. Bought some supplies from M & S food on the way and had a picnic on the lawn near Kensington Palace. Lots of people and plenty things happening. Princess Diana's memorial was very busy with loads of children paddling to cool off. Although it was busy, there were still plenty of spots if you wanted to be by yourself.||July 20, 2016
Carina L||50||Although I've been living in London for 2 months studying for some reason I never went to Hyde Park until my recent visit. And WOW! The park is absolutely stunning. The further into the park you get the better. It's peaceful and beautiful to walk there. As a big fan of nature I really recommend visiting Hyde Park. My friend and I were lucky with the weather and went on a sunny day which just added to the amazing walk-through. If visiting London one must visit Hyde Park!||July 20, 2016
Posse29||40||Bought an M&S picninc to eat in the park (shop near to Harrods) hired a deckchair for an hour for 1.60 GBP each and enjoyed the sunshine. Visited the Princess Diana Memorial, lovely to see all the kids playing in the water. Nice cold beer in the bar||July 20, 2016
capet002||40||We have walked through Hyde Park a few times on this trip. It is just so large; every time I see something I had not noticed before. There are many options---rent a paddle boat at the Serpentine, jog through on one of the many paths or just sit on a bench to do some people watching. There are large open spaces where you can kick around a soccer ball and shady as well as sunny spots to gather with friends. We also walked by a few monuments and Kensington Palace. There were many people on bikes which was confusing because there seem to be restricted areas for biking in the park. If you aren't familiar with the park a map is a necessity.||July 19, 2016
Israel L||50||Although a lot of tourists occupy this area. It's a nice getaway spot within the city. If you want to have lunch. Look at the swans and ducks swim or just stretch out across the grass; all are suitable. It's also a spacious park for a nice bike ride. There are bike hubs within the park where you can rent a bike.||July 19, 2016
idile2015||50||First of all, the park turned out to me much bigger than I anticipated so prepare yourself for a good exercise :) There are swans, goose, and lots of people enjoying themselves. It is a great green area. The gardens for Kensington Palace are very pretty which is to the west of the park.||July 19, 2016
mclairebear||40||We arrived at Hyde Park on a whim one day and decided to explore it. We only had about an hour so we didn't opt to pay for the entry fee to one section of the park. But the free section was beautiful including a gorgeous garden area and pond. We stopped to buy a picnic at the café in the park and sat by the pond to enjoy the scenery and our lunch. ||July 19, 2016
giuliag622||50||This gigantic green area is one of my favorite locations in London: quite, relaxing, peaceful. Serpentine Lake is beautiful, there are swans, birds, squirrels (many people feed them , don't know if that is allowed) and a nice bar. It gets very Intimate and picturesque, especially in the sunset.||July 19, 2016
NLDS72||50||You can walk, run, ride a bike, watch some birds, smell flowers, rent a canoe, etc! It is perfect for a sunny day.||July 19, 2016

jilly103||50||Great place to have concert. Lucky enough it was a beautiful sunny day. Plenty of people using park for leisure. Speakers corner quiet for a Sunday. Probably due to concert. ||July 18, 2016
Charles Z||50||Short walk from Buckingham Palace with stroll down tree lined paths, very nice. The Park is large and would take atlas several hours to see. But go for the peace and relaxation after a day of walking and sightseeing.||July 18, 2016
HeavensAngels||40||Lovely park! You can get the bikes near the Marble Arch entrance to ride through the park (for a small cost - use the Santander Cycling app), the grass is relatively clean too. Rode the pedalow in the large pond with the ducks, which was a great activity to do on a hot day. It cost us £12 per person for an hour and staff there were cheery and helpful. There were loads of groups, couples and families enjoying the park and this activity too (on a hot Monday). The queue for the pedalow wasn't long at all but can imagine it may at the weekend.I'd imagine more maps would be nice and helpful for those less familiar with the park. ||July 18, 2016
AnneM85213||40||My daughter and I walked through the park to get a little exercise after our 9 hour flight. Very green and beautiful, good walking paths. ||July 18, 2016

SWN||50||We are often in London but really have never spent too much time in Hyde Park except for the Winter Wonderland (or some such) that our friends take their children to. But this time we were at the end of a trip and staying across the road on the north side of the park at the Lancaster Hotel, and decided that we just wanted some recharge time for ourselves before traveling home. Hyde Park --- as many other reviewers have noted, was the perfect spot. The relief it provided from the hustle and bustle we had been dealing with in London for the couple days before that was remarkable and provided a much needed opportunity to stroll, chat, and generally relax. For those in need of a break, even if only for an hour or two, it’s highly recommended.||July 18, 2016
Mark L||50||Always a nice experience, free. Great views across the park and of the London skyline. Very quite. Well worth a visit. ||July 18, 2016
Amir H||40||It is nice place to go spend a day out, the view of the lake and the gardens is really stunning it is a must see, however in the weekend it was very crowded and it ruins the enjoyment. the lake features some boats for a ride at a price of 10pounds per person, and there is some cafes and kiosk where you can grab a drink.||July 18, 2016
haticee2013||50||It is perfect park for a full day activities. Picnic, sport. Good for children. Lots of playground. Bird watching. Lots of secret gardens...||July 18, 2016

Beautiful park lots of things going on a summer time concert, people dog walking, cafes open and the swans entertaining people. Very nice feel to the place we had a look at the Princess Diana memorial and the children playing. It was nice just to sit and people watch. I would recommend a walk or cycle in the park on a Sunday afternoon.||July 18, 2016

Floristeanu||50||Coming from a small city from Romania I couldn't believe how big this park can be. It is way bigger than my home city, unbelievable!On my 1st visit I walked through this beautiful park a few hours and I couldn't cross it from one end to another.It is incredibly clean, people visiting it are very civilised and they respect the animals and vegetation from this park.You definitely have to visit it more than once because it's impossible to see all of it in one day.||July 17, 2016
NWSesq||50||A great place to spend time reflecting on the simple things. Being immersed in nature, the sights and sounds are priceless..||July 16, 2016
travelwithme247||50||There were lots of people on Saturday and it was a nice day to be out. It has lots of room to walk around in the park. You can rent a chair, paddleboat, a row boat, and a bicycle in this area. There is also lots of green and the park is accessible to many tube and bus stops. Recommended! ||July 16, 2016
Kieron W||50||Had a lovely day at Hyde Park whilst watching Take That. Park looks well maintained, Impressed overall. You must have taken a picture under the marble arch.||July 16, 2016
lealeablue||50||Purpose of the visit was to see Take That, but we decided to have a walk through the park before the concert. As a huge royal fan it was lovely to see the Princess Diana memorial which is a great spot for families on a day out. Was my first visit to one of the Royal parks and lovely to see how beautifully kept it is. A must for a London visit. ||July 16, 2016
AfromN||50||If you need to relax a little this is the perfect place. Its a beautiful park. You can easily rent a bike and use it to cross this huge park. ||July 16, 2016
Dave G||50||Hyde Park is a fabulous venue, especially in the sunshine and boy did the sun shine on us this day. The British Summer Time event was the best I've been too, the VIP Summer Garden was great with lots of places to eat and drink and lots of comfortable seating, the toilets were good too. We had tickets for the diamond viewing area, not cheap but this is Stevie Wonder and a once in a lifetime for me so what the hell. This area is right in front of the stage and you can come and go as often as you like. If Stevie comes back to Hyde Park you will find me there.||July 16, 2016
HfamilyYork||50||Hyde Park is normally a beautiful tranquil haven to walk around in London.But Take That and fellow performers, including Olly Murs, Ella Eyre and Jamie Lawson, transformed all that into a fantastic music venue that we shared with 65,000 others on a Saturday night in July.The concert was part of the British Summer Time 10-day series featuring the best of pop, rock, dance, indie, and soul acts. This year there was a choice of headliners such as Take That, Mumford and Sons, Florence and the Machine, Carole King, Stevie Wonder, Pharrell Williams, Corinne Bailey Rae, King and Massive Attack. With two stages to choose from, a myriad number of bars and restaurants and other attractions, this was a fantastic day out and a great use of the parkland.Take That were fabulous and we will definitely look out for this concert series next year.Just a word to the organisers - please put in more ladies toilets next year, the queues were ridiculous.||July 15, 2016
Catherine B||40||I went with a friend to see TT at the BST festival on 9th July. The day was fantastic. Getting into the concert was a bit haphazard but that is no reflection on the park. It's huge and beautiful. I didn't get to see it all but I liked what I did see. It is a fab place to have an outdoor show and the atmosphere was fantastic||July 15, 2016
R B||50||Pick a park, any park... great open grass areas for taking in a lovely day, and all the paths you could want for a walk or bike.||July 15, 2016
manimountain||50||I strongly suggest that you visit Hyde Park . From my side if my visit was not atcend of my day , it would have been in the morning 6 AM yes the best unique feeling ever with the flowers smell||July 15, 2016
Stephen A||50||It has everything. Princess Diana waterfall was a major hit with my son. Great fun and well laid out park. We went for a trip on the boats and had lunch in the restaurant. Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend for a visit.||July 15, 2016
Janine-FMP||50||I truly enjoyed walking through Hyde Park. It was a relaxing morning of puppies, joggers, peace and quiet. The cafe nearby was particularly lovely as you walk in to fresh baked pastries and brewed coffee.The Diana memorial was beautiful and the Peter Pan statue added fun to the park.I highly recommend a visit while in London for a bit of solace.||July 15, 2016
JDLZ_90||50||Such a lovely place in the sun, lot's of green areas and many water features. The park feels completely safe and I enjoyed watching everybody's dogs play with one another without any fighting.||July 15, 2016
Ashley-Smile4||40||You can spend the whole day here as Kensington Palace is on the other park which is beside this park. I walked but I would advise to rent a bicycle. It was not over crowded. Beautiful area for a relaxing day!||July 15, 2016
Joe D||50||What can i say? Stevie Wonder appearing in one of the most gorgeous outdoor parks in the world with a perfect sunny day. How can the visitors to the UK NOT go and see this amazing wonder? And the locals, well, you have it right.||July 15, 2016
Y6296KImikes||40||Picturesque place for a stroll or a bike ride. If you happen to be close, by all means have a stroll. If you have very limited time in London, miss it.||July 15, 2016
622maryc||50||Something for everyone at Hyde Park. Guys played tennis ( reserve court), I visited Kensington palace( separate review). Enjoyed the serpentine lake. Rent a bike is nearby- so lots of cycling in park. Princess Di memorial beautiful. Great view of Prince Albert memorial. A perfect way to take a break from the city without leaving. ||July 14, 2016
MountainSongBird||50||Because it's hard to tell where Kensington Gardens ends and Hyde Park begins, this is a double review for both:Great place to unwind and take in beautiful God-created nature after all the man-made attractions in London. Took two strolls around and through this park and Hyde Park on our way to other attractions. Huge place with lots of walking trails, much larger than the map would indicate...takes a long time to go from one end to the other. Pretty ponds with swans, lots of bunnies out in the twilight on the grassy lawns. Lots of children playing on this warm and lovely Saturday afternoon at the Princess Diana Memorial Playground, and yummy ice cream cones there, too. It was just a few days after the anniversary of Princess Diana's birthday...dozens of roses and letters still left on the palace gates. Don't miss the Peter Pan statue on a side trail!||July 14, 2016
L000R||50||We went to London to see Stevie Wonder in BST Hyde Park - fantastic venue for this event. Well managed by all the staff, good facilities, food, bar - it's an evening I will never forget. Beautiful Park to have it and very easy to get to ||July 14, 2016
loves2holiday2016||50||I live near Hyde Park so go most weekends. Great to walk around, it's clean, you can hire pedlos or row boats on the serpentine and grab a coffee near Kensington Palace or by the Serpentine!||July 14, 2016
William A C||50||If you go to London this is a great place for people watching and sight seeing. Really beautiful place to visit.||July 14, 2016
MrsGiroud||50||What's not to like about Hyde Park? - It's huge (hard to believe it's in the middle of a busy City)- it's got a lake (rent a boat)- plenty of places for food and drink (to purchase)- bring your own picnic- Speaker's corner where you can take to your soapbox and have your say- plenty of events like Winter Wonderland and British Summer TimeI actually forgot what a wonderful park it is. We had the pleasure of seeing Take That last weekend and when the sun shines in London, there's no better place to be||July 14, 2016
marklJ4112YN||50||I spent two days in London. I love Hyde Park - I ran around it in the evening of my first day. It takes about 45 minutes to run the 5 mile perimeter of the Park and there is so much too see it could take longer.I also took an early morning walk around the park. I followed the Princess Diana walk. It's a lovely walk with lots to see. There are clear directions embedded in the oath making it really easy to follow the trail.If you have a few days in London I would recommend you walk or run round the park - there's a lot to see.||July 14, 2016
Kieran C||50||Picturesque. You can have a lovely long walk along the river, take some lunch and eat in the park, or ride a bike around it. It's beautiful.||July 14, 2016
ThebazileP||50||What a fantastic walk in the park! It was pouring rain, but I didn't care, cuz I had my poncho on! Honestly, I could live in this area. I would bike all over and be in this park every day. The Speaker's Corner was my highlight because I love when people gather and have a friendly conversation. Too fun. I recommend going here if you can. The gardens and fountains are quite lovely. You'll want to bring your camera. ||July 13, 2016
stevrico1||50||This park is stunning, as a natural botanical garden features so many types of plant life, wild life and social life you'll be amazed. If you like to people watch this is the place! Beauty is abound everywhere you look and its close Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby, and White Hall and Big Ben! Hyde Park is to London, what Central Park is to London! Lovely!||July 13, 2016
RacheyPink||50||I've visited Hyde Park numerous times, most recently I attended the British Summer Time Festival which was brilliant. A great location for watching live bands and it was well organised. The park is nice to walk around on a hot summers day, especially with a picnic! There are plenty of bikes available to hire to ride around the park. Winter Wonderland is also very good. What amazes me is the amount of planes you see coming in to land; literally every 30 seconds or so! So defo the place for plane spotters...||July 13, 2016
949zenae||50||Attended a concert for the first time here. Stevie Wonder was the top act. We had a brilliant evening but was packed so once you found a place you had to stay put. Visited Hyde Park in June and I just find it so lovely you cannot believe that you are not far from the city. You can easily spend a whole day just walking around or sitting relaxing there. One of my favourite parks in London. ||July 13, 2016
882rachelw||40||I love Hyde Park and have walked through it many times from Paddington Station to get to where I need to go rather than take the tube. I have visited in all weathers, from sitting and enjoying the peaceful surroundings on a sunny day to wintery walk in the snow!I have attended the Christmas Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park which to be honest wasn't really very wintery or wonder'y and certainly not for me, although the kids did enjoy this expensive tacky evening out and I would recommend the tasteful ice sculptures.But for the first time ever I recently attended BST Festival at Hyde Park to watch Take That. We arrived at around 1.30pm and enjoyed lunch from one of the many vendors but from around 4pm onwards you could barely move around the site as people were stood blocking all of the paths, this was such a shame and we chose to starve rather than fight our way through the crowds to find dinner. By the time the main act arrived on stage, I really did feel pretty suffocated by the 65,000 strong sell out crowd. The show was awesome and the atmosphere pretty amazing, although I couldn't see the stage or the big screens very well, I was still very happy to be there experiencing it. I stress you really do need to arrive super early to get a decent spot.At the end of the show as 65,000 people headed towards the exits, many of the actual park exits were closed for crowd control making the leaving process confusing and absolute carnage. I would definitely attend another concert here but I have definitely learnt from my first experience and may even upgrade tickets for a better view.||July 13, 2016
briancK3368JL||40||We had a great walk thru the park and took lots of pictures. There is a certain area where the little green birds (not sure what they are but they look like little parrots) will land on you to feed. If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city this is a great place to do it.||July 13, 2016
Marta W||50||This is a lovely place for tourists and locals to grab some fresh air and sun (when it shines). We loved seeing doggies, kiddies and oldies enjoying themselves on skates, bike and feet. Easily located restrooms and kiosks for tea and snacks made our walk very pleasant.||July 13, 2016
Alohanomers||50||I could have stayed for a lot longer, wish I did so much beauty and colors... the grounds are kept wonderfully, the scenery is awesome ||July 13, 2016
Jackie H||50||Lovely walks and plenty of places to people watch. Some interesting historic sights too...the Albert Memorial and the Serpentine gallery. Places to eat but not always the best experience. You can hire a boat too and watch the roller skaters or even the horses on Rotten Row. Search out the putting green...it is there but takes time to find.||July 13, 2016
BestieB||50||Attended Hyde Park for the British Summer Time Stevie Wonder concert, ideally located for all transport options. Beautiful open spaces within the park & wonderful facilities ||July 13, 2016
Dearmans||40||Hyde Park its self was lovely on a sunny day in July, picnic under a tree was great, sitting peacefully watching the world go by. Having been to concerts in the park before it was disappointing that the main walkways were not kept clear as we were sure they had been in the past. ||July 13, 2016
youngman52||40||Hyde park is a beautiful park that links all the west in in a green swathe of relaxation. Its easy to walk or jog in and just the sheer size makes you feel relaxed no matter what road you enter from and suddenly you feel you have escaped One downside is that if you need to go to the bathroom and are desperate you will have an issue finding what you needAlso in the summer I know from experience whilst the icecream vendors are all licenced they do rip you off which I think is a scam||July 13, 2016
Jasmine5Thomas||40||A nice quite park, well maintained, and a good place to get away from most of the hustle and bustle of London, lots of events also.||July 13, 2016
urajay||50||We also stumbled upon a small area where we can play lawn bowling here at Hyde Park (Will to Win) ! Excellent place ! Also try the italian food a few mins walk away from here : Pierino Pizza Pasta... very courteous ppl and good food ! Cheers !||July 13, 2016
480kimberleyl||30||This park contains many statues and walks that are interesting to see. It also has Kensington Palace (the residence of Wills and Kate when they are in London.) You will see many squirrels running about too.||July 13, 2016
Chris G||50||We grabbed a group of deckchairs in between the lake and Rotten Row so we could enjoy the rather expensive picnic we had just purchased in the large world famous department store a short way away and spent a great afternoon watching the horse riders and reluctantly feeding the geese who wouldnt leave us alone!! ||July 13, 2016
ZEEVS70||30||This park is huge!!Don's try to walk from speakers corner to Diana's monument because your legs will kill you.Better visit in two seperate days or take a bus in between.The park is nice with ducks and birds and very peacfull.||July 13, 2016
Namita S||40||This park is lovely for a walk, with squirrels running around the area & beautiful trees all around. The park is quite large & has a modest water body with about three dozen birds squawking & chirping. There is a small cafe next to this lake as well.||July 13, 2016
Smithythefish||50||Great park with occasional events on such as concerts which we recently attended. Fabulous open air venue surrounded by stunning views on London. Very relaxing and nice to kick back and chill.||July 13, 2016
Jane H||40||Wow this park is big. My brother and I walked there to see Mumford and Sons play at the British Summer Time music event. We would have liked to have seen more of the park but the music was our main reason for visiting. From what I saw this park is vast and beautiful. I will definitely revisit next time I go down to London as the tiny bits I saw were well worth a second, third, fourth visit.....||July 12, 2016
OzoroczyDia||50||Huge park with flowers birds squirrels boats lakes outside activities programs concerts icecream and many more. Who needs more? Even if you are alone or with friends or family or with your love this is a perfect place to visit. Walk with your dog or have a picnic go out and have fun at a really big and beautiful park in the middle of London. Don't forget to take your camera and football with you. The Oxford Street is next to the park so you can go there for a shopping in the halftime of your football game. Don't miss to walk down to the Exhibition Road for a dinner (easy to find VEGAN food). ||July 12, 2016
ChristiHamilton||50||Our hotel was right across the street from Hyde Park so many mornings we grabbed a coffee or tea and took a long walk. Some of my family went running...which they said was awesome, but I'm here to tell you that walking was just perfect. The park is gorgeous with crazy beautiful flowers and ancient, huge trees. We walked the park from Knightsbridge to Kensington Palace, and back. There is a place to swim, ride horses, walking trails, and plenty of bike paths. If I had more time I would have taken a picnic and spent hours in the park. It's beautiful. ||July 12, 2016
phils280||50||An excellent day spent in Hyde Park for the final of this years British Summer Time concerts - Stevie Wonder. A masterful performance by a true musical legend spreading his own very special message of peace and love. ||July 12, 2016
Naomi M||50||Hyde Park is gorgeous and massive, but the best part of it is Princess Diana's memorial fountain: a lovely and fitting tribute, there are kids of all ages splashing about and having the best time. Her spirit is surely there.||July 12, 2016
mounirpdg||50||Best park in London. So relaxing just walk and enjoy the company your with. Sure in terms not a lot to see but it's a great day out. A lot of open space for privacy and a few coffee shops. Recommend. ||July 12, 2016
Jimmy-London1||50||Great park for the kids.Great park to stroll.Great park for couples.Things to do in the park -peddles boats,Santander bikes to hire,strolls.||July 12, 2016
Jackie C||40||Went to hyde park for an open aired concert, staff were pleasant, and helpful in giving directions. Plenty of food/drink bars and toilets either end of where the stages were. It was ashame when the acts finished no other music was playing in the back ground. Olly murs and jamie lawson were amazing, shame i cant say the same about take that, infact whilst they were on for awhile i was at the silent disco, which until saturday i didnt know what it was about had a great time dancing about with headphones on looking like i had lost my marbles !!! All in all we had a good day very well organised||July 11, 2016
Fleider||50||Huge park with lots of attractions. Extremely well maintained and secure. Mandatory in any London visit. Don't miss it!||July 11, 2016
Hels72bels||40||Spent the whole day here, facilities were excellent and organisation was superb. Great choice for food and drinks. Music was fantastic- the only downside was the music wasn't loud enough...we had no idea what the artists was saying and could only sing along because we could hear others singing along- shame really because everything else was fantastic ||July 11, 2016
beachwalker2016||10||For my sister's special birthday treat I spent £500 on two tickets to see Carole King sing her wonderful album Tapestry from the Diamond View section of Barclaycard Summer Time 2016 in Hyde Park. It was billed as the best view of the stage. Imagine our horror when she came on only to sit down at her piano at the back of the stage which completely obscured her from the view of all of us who were occupying this alleged hallowed bit of turf in Hyde Park. Those who had paid less than half the price of our tickets got the full view of Carole, seated, singing her heart out. The set was short and the number of times she left the piano stool were even shorter. Think hard before you part with your money for this type of gig. When I complained I was basically told it was 'tough' and that the artist decides where to sit. So don't read the promotional rubbish about what you will get for your money. I agree with another reviewer that the food and drink were hugely over-priced and particularly poor. The weekend cost me well over £1,000 with travel and hotel. It was from my savings. I wish it was still in my bank, that I had stayed at home, played the album and taken my sister on holiday instead. Be warned.||July 11, 2016
Reinhold S||40||To visit the hydepark is a location you need to go, a lot of flowers, birds, well cleaned, there're enough restaurants where you have drinks and small snacks||July 11, 2016
Eunice H||50||Fantastic venue and fantastic park to walk around. It's very well kept and delightful to see so many activities going on , horse riding , roller blading, runners, joggers, footballing and beautiful gardens||July 11, 2016
funwales||40||A slow start to the show,tickets stated 1pm start,but nothing happened until 6.30 pm everyone was there to see a Take that which didn't come on until around 8pmBut when it did start it was awesome.Didn't rate the facility's at Hyde park either queued around 35mins for the woman's toilets,didn't bother queuing for food it would have taken 1hr||July 11, 2016
Sue S||50||Lovely park, away from the hustle and bustle, enjoyed a peaceful picnic lunch here many times, green and serene.||July 11, 2016
hyperballad0||50||I am reviewing BST @ Hyde Park and not Hyde Park itself. I have rated the park 'Excellent' but the BST summer gig series would get an 'Average'. They cram far too many people into the area and the lines at bars, food places etc spill over into the crowd which makes it near impossible to walk from one place to another. The 'Premium View' pass is a joke as again it's sold to too many people and we ended up watching Stevie Wonder on the TV screen which we could have done with a standard ticket.Stop trying to make as much money as you can Barclaycard and think about the satisfaction of the people attending these events.||July 11, 2016
john1002_11||50||First time to Hyde park to go to the BST take that festival, park is so clean and great amenities. Lots to do and a boating lake, you will not be disappointed.||July 11, 2016
thehoust||50||Absolutely amazing! Artists were great, Stevie Wonder is a true living legend! Setup of bars, food stalls, toilets were great and done with lots of imagination! Security and management of the event was great and friendly - A truly magical experience ||July 11, 2016
Lucy R||40||We went specifically for the Take That BST concert which was amazing, that was in the south east corner of Hyde Park. We spent some time visiting the west end of the park, which is massive! Kensington Palace was beautiful with immaculate gardens, lovely places to play or sit and admire the view. Take a wander to the Royal Albert Hall or Harrods which are nearby. If you're in London take some time to check this beautiful open space out!||July 11, 2016
Lini999||40||I had a day in London with loose ends and visited Hyde Park. Unfortunately there was an event there so could not venture very far in the park. It was nice to walk around. It is also within public transport.||July 11, 2016
Susan A||50||Very clean and tidy. Quiet even when people walking or jogging. Plenty of space. Special cycling routes so no fear of getting run into. Good signage.||July 11, 2016
EmmyB76||50||Fantastic day at Hyde park the venue and our premium tickets were great. I would not although ever recommend getting a package from EVENT TRAVEL rip off merchants. Face value of our tickets were far cheaper than we realised and the total we paid for what we got was a joke. The hotel Ambassador was disgusting and was not worth anywhere near the price we paid, totally put a downer on the whole trip. Went for a package to get a bit of luxury but really didn't deliver!! Don't make the same mistake.||July 11, 2016
Jenny E||40||This is such an amazing park to walk through from the boat lake to the gardens to the wide open spaces. It's a stunning place in the sun and very relaxing. I have cycled through and in most places it's great to be able to get around but there are a number of lanes you can start down and find you can't navigate where you want to go because cycling is not allowed. Definitely go here and relax especially in the sunshine.||July 11, 2016
David W||40||We came to Hyde Park to see Take That on Saturday. On the way there, we called in to Kensington Palace. We were informed when we arrived that there were certain areas that were inaccessible for wheelchairs, which we were fine with. With the help of the staff of Kensington Palace, we managed to visit most of it. We also called at a pub restaurant by The Serpentine on the way, where we could charge our scooter and power wheelchair. We had a very enjoyable day.||July 11, 2016
410sheenab||40||The show was fantastic. Take That superb as always, Olly Murs showed why he's now a star.Not enough toilets, too far away. Ran out of wine!!! ||July 10, 2016
Tarro2001||40||Having looked forward to this for quite some time, the show itself was amazing - all the acts put on a fantastic performance - especially Take That as usual. However I think the organisation of the event itself was appalling. We arrived at Hyde Park and asked a member of staff where the queue was for south entrance priority. We were shown and dutifully joined the end of the queue, only for the same girl and another member of staff tell us we were in the wrong place and needed to go further up and pointed us in the "right" direction. We went and were met at the gate where we were directed to go to be by two very confused members of staff who informed us we needed to go to the back of the queue we had just come from or find where the priority queue ended and general admission begun. We walked back the length of the queue and everyone seemed to be priority so we went to the back again and ended up further back than we were when we started - naturally no one was accepting responsibility for this despite speaking to several members of staff! We stayed in the queue and we got in and found a place on the first bit of grass not far from the barriers that sperated us from the VIP section. We sat down at approximately 1240. As the afternoon went on we were enjoying the sunshine and the music and people were sitting on the grass beyond the path that was just behind us. However as the day got later and the bigger acts like Ella Eyre and Olly Murs were coming on people were standing on the path (at least 3/4 people deep)making it difficult to get from one place to another or even get to the toilets! The poor people who had been sitting on the grass behind them since 1pm now couldn't see a damn thing because people who had come later were just standing everywhere. In my opinion once the first section of grass had been filled there should have been some barriers put up or some kind of control as to where people were standing - the path should have been kept clear as this was a blatant health and safety issue. We saw a poor girl having a panic attack and no one around her was willing to move or give her some space despite her crying and pleading and the staff were no where to be seen, and it took at least 20 mins to get from where we were at post 6 to the toilet (probably a minutes walk at most!) I also myself witnessed a man pushing a lady in a wheelchair trying desperately to get through on the path but to no avail, and again no staff anywhere to help them so I did it myself and upon asking people politely to mind out of the way getting a lot of evil looks until they realised there was a wheelchair behind me. Once Olly Murs had come on the section in which we were standing had at least trebled in the amount of people and we found this very unfair as we had paid extra and been sat in the same spot and been trampled on all day only for people to come in and push their way to the front. The staff were very few and far between and although their is nothing that can be done for people pushing in, the queuing was ridiculous and the sheer number of people blocking the path through the park was absolutely obsurd and definitely should have been kept clear. I would have thought this has been brought up before as so many events have been held at HP - maybe this is some thing to bare in mind for future events as it was despicable and unsafe!||July 10, 2016
sradesmet||40||Nice place to relax, go for a walk, a swim. Beautiful chilled out place with a great playground for children ||July 10, 2016
891paulines||50||Great venue for a concert 65000 people however we paid for priority tickets which allowed us entry 1 hr before general admission. Got a lovely spot as did numerous other priority ticket holders, like true British you always leave a small space between your picnic blanket and the next persons, keep with me and you will see what Im getting at!Everything going well until the bands start to play and the people behind with general admission tickets see that space and there Im now staring at a backside or being trodden on by someone trying to get closer to the front pretending that they have lost someone or are looking for someone. In the end you have no choice but to pick up your picnic blanket and stand to guard your space. Why you cant have a section for priority ticket holders like premier I dont know. Also if the footpaths were kept free more people would visit the food outlets.The concert itself was first class Take That, Olly Murs and Ella Eyre The staff are very helpful and try and help but as the night wears on you end up going with the flow.I will get Premier or VIP ticket next time.||July 10, 2016
Z1906UUamandap||50||Something for everyone here, joggers, families and lovers of beautiful scenery. The Italian garden is incredibly beautiful. Peaceful with lots of good, small cafes. Well worth a visit. ||July 10, 2016
Michelle M||50||I could have spent a day there, it is very big and very beautiful - we saw the British summertime show with Take That which was amazing and I'd love to go back.||July 10, 2016
MiniBarlow||40||The park is very large, so there will always be somewhere you can find to sit and get some peace an quiet. There are lots of paths to follow if you want to go for a run, cycle or rollerblade.||July 10, 2016
ejcunninghame||40||Myself and my daughter went to bst for take that. Stage was amazing. Atmosphere great. Good venue for gigs. Only downside was we felt stage was too low. Although we were about halfway in the crowd we were unable to see the bands on the stage and had to watch it on the big screen. Would have benefited from a higher stage.||July 10, 2016
julie m||50||Needs more seating , more gluten free from outside caterers as we not allowed to take food, well organised, ||July 10, 2016
Heartfruit||50||There is a lot to see in Hyde Park. We spent two hours doing a circuit of the pond. The Italian Gardens were lovely even in the rain. My daughter was delighted by the Peter Pan statue. I enjoyed watching the swans. My husband got a big kick out of Speakers Corner. Best time to go to speakers corner is Sundays after 11.||July 10, 2016
Bharati U||50||We were there on week end .Enjoyed the garden's beauty in all way .beautiful landscape.,beautiful people strolling around, runners,picnickers and what not! spent some time at the speaker's corner. In all it's the must place of London not to be missed...!||July 10, 2016
dmitra99||40||A vast open space...really vast....merging onto Kensington Gardens on the west. Relax here, walk here, jog here, cycle here. Or just romanticize with a leisurely stroll. Be sure to click a map of the park on your smartphone to identify your exit...use GPS...it's easy to get lost. Connects to many tube stations on all four sides of this rectangular piece of heaven.||July 10, 2016
Susan0811||50||Lovely park to sit in and enjoy the sunshine. Lots to see and explore. We walked most of the park and there is bikes you can hire.||July 10, 2016
Melinda B||50||Can I just say how beautiful this park is. It has a beautiful flower garden at the east end and as you progress further into the park you come upon a beautiful lake with lakeside cafes. I went to the Princess Diana memorial and it is wonderful. It is a fountain where children are playing and enjoying the water. I even put my feet in it and it was really a happy place. Further down is a statue of Peter Pan that needs to be seen by the eye, no description can capture the monument. At the end of my walk was an Italian Garden with numerous fountains and flowers with people eating ice cream and spending time together. It is a must see in London.||July 10, 2016
952tamaram||40||Love it.It is lovely place for walk, by yourself or in company.For joggers is must.Lake in the midle is nice, so who has a time just go for it||July 10, 2016
UKRealtor||50||Hyde park is like entering a different planet of fun happiness peace and quiet yet there is so much activity all around you it is amazing In the centre of London you feel safe and secure with no signs of crime except maybe the odd dog chasing a ball into the lake.Everyone is friendly and lots to do and see||July 10, 2016
Toyah1||50||Been in here quite a few times and never got bored of it! The park is so nice with a buzz in the atmosphere every time! Take That were playing last night so heard them while walking round! Found Peter Pan statue and Princess Diana's memorial fountain and ended up having a beer at The Lido! Beautiful park highly recommended :) ||July 10, 2016
sambZ7801IB||40||We want for a 7k stroll and saw a lot of nature in the middle of London. Good to have a place like the to relax. Concerts in the park is always nice. Try it out! ||July 10, 2016
Vern L||50||Pleasant surrounding. Ducks, geese, swans and othe water birds (with their young a t certain times oft heyday) to see in the Serpentine and the odd squirrel on the grass. Stop anywhere sit and take in the quiet that exists in the heart of London. What happened the locals walking their dogs whilst others ride horses and bicycles. It's a good place to relax ||July 10, 2016
Jayne P||50||We would definitely recommend going to any festivals in the park, everything ran very smoothly, all the facilities were brilliant from catering to lavatories, made enjoying the music more enjoyable. Looking forward to going again.||July 10, 2016
kpiddy||50||The Hyde Park is one of eight Royal Parks in London open for the public to visit. On a previous visit we visited the enchanting Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain and Serpentine Lake. The weather was very unpleasant on the day of our recent visit, cold, windy and at times light rain, we were making our way through the park after a visit to the V&A museum to visit the Australian War Memorial just outside the gates of the park. The day had be planned to have a picnic lunch in the park that was before the weather turned fowl. It was disappointing that the park has the minimal amount of seating and difficult to locate. We found a few bench chairs down by the Serpentine Lake out in the open, there did not appear to be any seating with shelter from the elements in this section of the park that we walked, let's hope that there is somewhere else in the park.||July 9, 2016
Pavel54||50||Brits are proud of it. Yes, it's the way you should have a public park. You can walk on the grass with your dog and spend on it entire day.||July 9, 2016
Nicole S||50||I greatly recommend walking around Hyde Park...rainy or not, there are plenty of things to do and see. Don't miss it. ||July 9, 2016
atmananda||50||The majestic trees and finely manicured gardens are a nature lovers delight. And it's free. Great relaxing site in the midst of busy London.||July 9, 2016
Trvl_FunTX||40||Meticulously maintained garden, lawn, an pleasantly surprised apperance of animals and fowls made it a well worthy time spent. ||July 9, 2016
rachael1912||50||Fantastic, lush, activity filled park!!! Could write loads but will make it short and sweet! Amazing large river, scrummy cafés and swimming in the lake as well as pedalos and lots more! Green grass surrounds the glistening lake in the sun! Beautiful fresh and very entertaining park! Definitely visit! ||July 9, 2016
Anattol||50||We had a hotel just at the entrance to the park. Every morning in our one week trip we went to the park, and it was great. A lot of green, some fountains and ponds, nice little spots to see and play there. Great park to pass an hour or two||July 9, 2016
luis d||50||if you´re travelling with children i would recommend to focus at the north area, entering through lancaster gate, then Peter pan´s statue is very near and Diana´s playground area at the right hand side. ||July 9, 2016
mmespi42||50||Hyde Park is a place that you should visit if you visit London.It is a great way to enjoy the natural environment and is very interesting to see all the trees and grass bright and green with cold and rain and a lot of birds taking a bath in its water.It's a unique filling of peace.And also you can enjoy restaurants, monuments and in my opinion it is a place that you will always remember. Hyde Park es un lugar que si visitas Londres estas obligado a visitar.Es una maravillosa manera de disfrutar de la naturaleza y es interesante ver como los arboles, la grama y en general la vegetacion mantiene un color verde brillante a pesar del frio y la lluvia, ademas de muchas aves que se bañan en sus aguas. Se siente una total sensacion de paz Se puede tambien disfrutar de sus restaurantes y monumentos.En mi opinion es un lugar para recordar siempre||July 8, 2016
SunshineHug||30||Hyde Park is a nice activity and place to visit with family and maybe good for couples because is a huge park, however not very clean. As a solo, I did not feel safe and honestly did not stay long. Neighbourhoods around the park are wonderful and with a very English style, walk around the park and explore the city.||July 8, 2016
Aamka||40||Nice and big park, a little bit too big even. A lovely playgroud near the Knightsbridge underground station. Lots of birds and unfortunately bird droppings as well, mind your shoes!! Nice squirrels and trees and flowers. There was even a black swan, excellent!! We walked past the swimming area and that was terrible!! It was full of bird droppings and looked very bad. Would not swim there! Threre were also rats running in the cafeteria and toilet area.Maybe not a good place to be after dark...||July 8, 2016
tammyjewel628||50||great to visit - beautiful - lots of walking, but peaceful and tranquil and lots to see - Kensington Palace is beautiful ~||July 8, 2016
97jeje||40||Really good place to go in the summer when the weather is good even to just ex revise. You can ride bikes and just relax and have a picnic and walk around or ride boats. Annoying to have to pay for the toilet even had a woman there to make sure you do.||July 8, 2016
Heikki H||40||If you feel like to say your opinion... you can go there and say it out loud... nice place when happens to be sunny day. Can have something to eat and drink with you. Nice place to visit.||July 8, 2016
Ben G||40||We went after seeing the activities on the bus to have a nosey to see what what was going off. really nice place with lots of greenery to say it's in the city. Nice and peaceful on one side lots of activities to do on the other.||July 8, 2016
Kinga K||50||I love park. All park. Always I can find place to mute and relax. And always I come back to them. :) ||July 8, 2016
StudentNurse_BE||40||Hyde Park is such a big park that (even when it is crowded) there will be place with less people. It is very clean. It's lovely to stroll around and 'get lost' in nature.||July 8, 2016
Marlene S||40||Beautiful park, loved the water features and statues. My husband and Grandchildren hired bikes and did some cycling which was great fun!||July 8, 2016
Sudhindra N||50||Whether you want to run, jog, stroll, relax, sleep, enjoy nature, dine by the water or watch the pigeons, its all there at the Hyde Park. The colors are vibrant and just come alive with a bit of sunshine. Its something you should not miss on your visit to London. It's not just another park!||July 8, 2016
bradleyb27||50||Beautiful place lovely boating lake been many times. Plenty of parking spaces. Always have other attractions going on. ||July 8, 2016
Claire C||50||wonderful green space in the middle of London. you can sit on the grass and have a picnic whilst you watch the birds get on with their daily lives on the water or the ground. large enough that you can find a private spot any time of the day.||July 7, 2016
Barry S||40||Park is ideal for nice stroll when visiting London. Plenty to see and do. Cafe in park.Speakers corner well worth a visit||July 7, 2016
pammy071||50||We were staying nearby and intended just to visit the once, but we ended up by visiting it three times. There are wonderful trees, water features and lots of green open space. The wildlife is remarkably tame. The ring necked parakeets were landing on people's out-stretched arms. ||July 7, 2016
Kev O||50||A huge, centrally located must-see... amazing in the summer for relaxing or sport. Sundays have a real buzz to them! ||July 7, 2016
Bert T||40||Besides being a beautiful park, and the former hunting grounds of kings, it's a cool place to relax and visit with Londoners and perhaps, makes some new friends. Worth a stroll through for sure.||July 6, 2016
Anton C||50||We went up the city for a long weekend and took a stroll through The park which turned into a 2 hour lovely stroll . Great area for a little bit of dinner and a nice relax away from the hustle and bustle of London life ||July 6, 2016
lpMaggi713||50||Hyde Park is one of London’s eight Royal Parks. Millions of visitors visit every year. Hyde Park covers 350 acres and is home to a number of famous landmarks including the Serpentine Lake, Speakers' Corner, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain. The park also offers various recreational activities including open water swimming, boating, cycling, tennis and horse riding. You can row on the Serpentine.

rabisaha||50||It's the famous Hyde park, no reviews needed for it . It's beautiful and natural . Takes you back to history and in time z it is a must visit||July 6, 2016
FSCOLLAY||40||Walked this park which is really big, was disappointed with lady Diana's water feature though, expected more! The kids there seemed to enjoy it though & were splashing in it.. For the size of the park it really needs more public toilets. Great for those that live there as you can forget you are in a busy city, take a blanket & picnic & just enjoy..||July 6, 2016
Charles S||50||We were spoiled by visiting Hyde Park on a beautiful Sunday when the sun was shining. There must have been thousands of people in the park but we were only aware of the numbers as we entered and left. While in the park itself people dispersed to the areas the wanted to visit. All the public boats were out on the Serpentine and everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves. It was good to see that it was possible for visitors to purchase ingredients to make up a picnic without the necessity of going into a restaurant to eat.It was also good to see that along with the neatly trimmed lawn areas there were areas left to grow wild. There were some beautiful flowers to look at and these were particularly popular with the tourists from other countries. ||July 6, 2016
Terrycharleton||50||Hyde Park is huge and you can spend ages just walking around and watching the world go by. On one side is the Albert memorial which is worth a visit, or you can just sit by the lake and relax.||July 6, 2016
Michael C||40||We had priority tickets and arrived about 2p.m.After bag searches, we were basically told all we had the right to do was breathe.No chairs allowed,but we did use forbidden blankets on floor.Drinks were expensive,withat a bottle wine costing £22. The beers were rubbish,food expensive,with a hot dog costing g £8.We endured 4 hours of mediocre acts,buthe Don Henley was good and Carole King magnificent.Basically,facilities were a massive rip off and I would not visit this venue again.It is not what you make out of it,it is what they take from you in the end.Michael, Nottingham.||July 5, 2016
Mark42139||40||This is a beautiful London park, and we enjoyed our visit here! It's a great spot to people watch, have lunch...||July 5, 2016
celmk||50||I love walking in Hyde Park or running. It is so refreshing and so enjoyable. There are so many people there, but one could as well feel so alone. ||July 5, 2016
soundgesture||50||A great venue for the concerts in the park series in the summer. You might want to check exactly on the map of going to a concert, as it is a large park. Nice strolling through the park avenues, or just chilling in the meadow areas. Lots of fresh air in the lung of the city, and great to get away from the humdrum.||July 5, 2016
Rachel T||50||It's many years since I strolled in Hyde Park and, unusually, it's even better than I'd remembered. The Italian Garden looked beautiful with water lilies in bloom. The Diana Fountain was being used, as intended, for gentle paddling. There was actually a table free to enjoy a coffee looking over the Serpentine and this year's Serpentine Pavilion is a particularly interesting and elegant structure. But what struck me most pleasantly was the way spaces have been left wild with long grasses and reeds by the lake; the sound of sedge warblers more natural than that of the many parakeets.||July 5, 2016
konstantinos231||50||One of the most beautiful parks I have ever been to!! It's ideal for long walks, picnic, relaxing, playing even feed the different kind of animals.. ||July 5, 2016
emyersbrussels||40||Even on a day of changeable weather, this park was filled with people enjoying the beautifully landscaped open spaces and the well-cared-for gardens. Kensington Palace is at the west end of the park and is worth the admission fee for the self-guided tours. If you like walking in parks and relaxing in nature, you could spend an entire day here.||July 5, 2016
woskc05||50||The sun shining makes this a great place to visit, although with so much to see and do it likely really doesn't make much difference. Visit here anytime and so easy to get her using public transport if the walk here sounds too far||July 5, 2016
malcolm709||50||Concert in Hyde Park with Carole King singing the whole of 'Tapestry'. What an amazing once in a lifetime event, well organised, beautiful venue and a very moving event. The sun shone and it was just a stunning day.||July 5, 2016
805holly||50||Beautiful in any season, unless it's raining! In Autumn the colours are lovely but Hyde Park has some old-world charm any time of year. You can rent the Boris bikes and ride but it takes about 45 minutes to walk it's length on foot. Start at Marble Arch and finish at Kensington Palace. If you wish to rent a paddle boat or row boat on the lake it's expensive but can be romantic or a bit of fun. The Princess Diana Memorial fountain is good for young children on a warmer day. The park connects to St James's Park and Green Park so you can go through to Buckingham Palace as well. Good for picnics. Can be busy in peak season and on weekends in parks but it doesn't take long to get away from the crowds into a quieter part of the park. Somewhere the Londoners like to go to as well. ||July 5, 2016
Sharon S||50||Beautifully maintained gardens and lakes with fountains. Wide paved walkways throughout. Great photo ops! In one area a man was hand-feeding wild parrots. He gave us some seed and the parrots would fly down from the trees and light on your head, shoulders or arms. There are maps to help plan your walk. Restrooms near entrances.||July 5, 2016
Manu_GV||40||Beautiful place, all year long its magnificent, although the Benugo's Bar near the lake is really crappy with the large concrete terrasse it looks like a reformed Bunker. I still appreciate the rest of the park and would like to thank the staff for keeping it this way. ||July 5, 2016
KaGrima||50||Visited the park for one of the BST events.Festival was very well organized and by the next morning when I rode past on the bus you could see the place was already clean and ready for the next event.||July 5, 2016
14MikeM||50||Hyde Park is wonderful especially when the sun is shining. It is a large open space between bayswater Road to the north and Kensington to the south. The serpentine is great fro picnics or having a swim or using a pedal. We were there for a concert which was just fantastic. Highly recommended.||July 5, 2016
emmess2016||40||Attended BST festival starring Don Henley and Carole King who were both brilliant. The acts prior to this were mediocre to disappointing. However, the whole day was well organised, although drinks were very expensive, £2 for a bottle of water! There were a number of lucky people who managed to get through security with a full blown home made picnic with wine, very unfair considering we were thoroughly searched and had to give up some fruit we had brought along.||July 5, 2016
klj652015||40||We had a lovely stroll through Hyde Park to Kensington Palace and gardens. The public toilet was interesting, it was unisex and quite open. ||July 4, 2016
52julieB||40||i can see why they hold concerts here, it's a beautiful setting. Lovely huge park to wander around with lakes and wildlife a plenty. Blends nicely into Kensington gardens too. You can easily spend a whole day here.||July 4, 2016
SaraSuzy||50||Beautiful place to walk around and don't miss the Princess Diana Playground if you have children..very fun for all ages! ||July 4, 2016
Sally H||50||We went to the Barclaycard BST Hyde park festival for the first time this year. There were a few negative reviews about previous years so we went expecting a 'mixed bag'. We were not able to get the premium view tickets we wanted so decided to go for general admission anyway. We were not disappointed. Helpful staff, great fast food venues, clean and plentiful loos and abundantly staffed bars all helped add to the great music of Louise Goffin, Don Henley and the magnificent Carole King. There is an opportunity to upgrade your ticket once you get there but we decided not to and enjoyed watching with a huge and joyous crowd, the addition of big screens added to our enjoyment. So glad we did this festival.||July 4, 2016
planetawdrodze||50||I will always have the best memories with this Park. Everybody can find their "desert" here. I found mine. My magical tree of life. Just discover a little bit and hear the silence||July 4, 2016
SHERLOCKSanDiego_ca||50||Always fun to stroll through the grounds of this truly great English park. WE stopped to watch the Royal Horse Artillery ride at full gallop you a grassy knoll to present a royal gun salute to Prince Phillip on his 90 birthday. While this does not happen often the park itself is very relaxing and so close to Kensington gardens.||July 4, 2016
Juney25||30||We had lovely weather and a fantastic concert ,Carole King . The downfall was we did not see the acts on stage as too many people and had to watch the screens. Atmosphere was good though. The concert was well organised with security but it would have been nice to have a camping chair allowed as it was a long time to stand and I cannot sit on floor very well. I would like to see these concerts more organised with seating option that does not cost an arm and leg. The queuing for food was long as expected but due to the amount of people ( far too many ) the quality of food was poor from some stalls. It would have been much better to have had 30,000 people instead of the quoted 65,0000 . Just far too many . ||July 4, 2016
B622MBmikec||50||The British Summer Time festival offered Carole King in Hyde Park singing Tapestry for the first time ever. If you are in London this summer a visit is recommended. Lots of nets, many free.||July 4, 2016
Sue C||50||Great concert venue.Concert was brilliant saw Carol King and her Tapestry music in full.Plenty of food and drink venues when in park.Not allowed to take own food in only unopened bottles of water.||July 4, 2016
Solivagant1975||50||Even if you are short on time, if the weather is nice, there are several paths to walk through the park. Beautiful sculpture, wonderful placement of plants and trees. Lucky to hear Patti Smith on stage walking by the Summer Concert Series this past week.||July 4, 2016
354staceyg||40||You can truly feel that you're in the middle of the English country side right in the middle of the city.||July 4, 2016
Michelle C||40||So I went to see Florence, what a great venue. like its own little village in a corner of the park. fantastic.||July 4, 2016
Gerad B||40||We went to see the BST live concerts and as a venue this is great. Some of the arrangements are bizarre and Jobs Worth e.g. we bought our tickets from friends then tried to up-grade them on the day. we were forced to go the long way round even though there was no queue. The cost of Upgarde was a hefty £70 which we declined. We then got to the front of the cheap seats a few feet away from the premiums. ||July 4, 2016
Jim B||50||A great place for a concert in the park. Tickets not cheap but worth every penny. The event was very well organised, great staff, plenty of toilets and numerous food and drink outlets. Expensive, but normal prices for this type of event. Everything was well organised and clear directions. Great event for all ages.||July 4, 2016
Marieke v||40||Very nice to get away from the busy centre on a sunny day. Kensington Gardens are great, as is the Serpentine Gallery. Ideal for a relaxing stroll, icecream in hand, some nature and culture at one go. ||July 4, 2016
PipeCleanerWithEyes||50||I love staying in Kensington when in London, as it is close to the museum and this lovely park. There are statues, playgrounds (including a mini water park), restaurants, lakes, places to exercise dogs, a tree full of birds and squirrels that people feed nuts to, and a track that runs around the whole area. A must when in London!||July 3, 2016
Boudin882||50||Every year, Hyde Park hosts a number of concerts during successive week ends.The main act is supported by a number of other acts, and occasionally the support acts can put out a seriously good show. The VIP tickets allow you time to pace the day, relax and enjoy the numerous food and drink outlets.It also gets you a place in front of the Great Oak stage .On the day in question, the threat of torrential rain was non-existent, so plenty of warm sun.Many of the attending spectators were senior citizens, Thus, the Red Cross, and the crowd managers had to escort out a number of people who had fallen unwell.||July 3, 2016
232courtneyw||40||Came here and couldn't believe how big it was. The park has gorgeous areas to sit and have a picnic or take a paddle boat out on the lake. Definitely worth a visit! ||July 3, 2016
Hayska72||40||Just few minutes fron Harrods there is an opportunity to relax and sit down in legendary environment.||July 3, 2016
conrad169||50||Hyde Park is perfect for escaping the hustle of London for a walk, picnic or just a bit of quiet time. Only 5 minutes walk from Harrods too. Lots of squirrels and swans, great for kids. The boating lake is great where you can hire boats and pedalos. Great day out when the weather is nice.||July 3, 2016
RedDevil1504||50||Hyde Park is an absolute gem of a park. A world class location that reminds me of New York City's Central Park, only a little smaller. Beautiful gardens, walkways, trails, lakes and other seasonal attractions. Open water swimming, cycling, tennis, boating, running horseback riding are some of things available to do. A very peaceful setting. We could have spent all day relaxing and exploring it's many famous landmarks; Speakers Corner, Princess Diana Memorial, Serpentine Lake, the July 7th Memorial, Apsley Gate and so many others. We'll definitely return on our next visit to London. ||July 2, 2016
KCLStudent2015||50||Great place to walk, bike, have a picnic, or all the above. While the park can get busy at times it is so large that you can easily get away from any crowds. ||July 2, 2016
Rina H||50||soo much to do feed the ducks have a lovely walk sit , eat , play , sleep good for all . quiet place to take pics too.||July 2, 2016
Ray840||40||Really nice, big park. I was able to walk several miles without backtracking. It is rather easy for a newbie to get lost though. To get out though, all you have to do is walk in a straight line. ||July 2, 2016
great_travel_advisor||40||Hyde Park is HHHHUUGE. It's a nice place to relax after long hours of touring London. If you're visiting Buckingham Palace, it's a short walk from there.||July 2, 2016
Rhonda K||50||Our hotel was a short walking distance to Hyde park. It is a lovely park with many different pathways, and of course it leads to to Kensington Palace. Walk the street behind the Palace and look at many embassies..at the end of that street is a wee coffee shop names princess Diana. Very reasonable coffee and nibbles.. Rumour is, it was visited by Diana because of how close it is the the Palace.||July 2, 2016
Sash_1980||50||I've been to Hyde park a few times now and it's such a lovely park with loads to do and see, such as princess Diana's memorial, Kensington palace, Royal Albert Hall and Harrods very close by. The lake is very well kept and the play area for the children looks fantastic.||July 2, 2016
AnOtherExpat2016||50||An other beautiful old London park that's origins are steeped in history.My favourite walk is on the south side of the park around the Rotten Row area and then up towards the Serpentine. Whether there is a lot to do depends on your tastes but if beautiful walks are your thing than I find that you can't go wrong here and it is very, very central.||July 2, 2016
ElE109||50||its world class tourist attractions are renowned across the globe. The Greater London area is bursting with attractions for visitors of all ages. The river Thames runs through the heart of London, from Richmond in the west, through the central London borough of Westminster, to Greenwich in the east. London river cruises and river buses are a great way to see the city.||July 2, 2016
VickyBlum||50||Every step you take makes you discover something new. Animals, trees, gardens, a nice walk, take your time when strolling.||July 1, 2016
Darnel-HDI||50||Hyde Park is located in the midle of London City. Plenty of trees, flowers and grass. It is also the natural house of animals, swans, birds, squirrels and many other. The Park was very well maintained and very clear. It was worth to spend a half day walking in the park if you have enough time.||July 1, 2016
atlas_tw||50||In my view, Hyde Park along with Kensington Gardens is the best of Royal Parks. Enjoy a ride around on one of the Santander bikes, a morning/noon/evening run, a swim in the Long Water (restricted zone only), a picnic on the ever green grass rain or shine, trotting on a pony, or a choir in one of the "tree huts"..., not to mention all the seasonal events (Summer concerts, BBC Proms, Winter Wonderland...) Hyde Park has so much to offer for the eye, body and soul. It is a good 2-hour walk over a circumference of 4.5 miles; or 45 minutes of run. One always finds something new every time, whether it is a tree branching out, a new budding flower or a change of colour for the season. Enjoy this extremely well kept park and its nourishing environment.||July 1, 2016
marylou72||50||Hyde Park is so pretty with people and children walking everywhere on the lush green yard. Great place for a picnic. We were mainly at the end by Kensington Palace. Very nice and peaceful. Reminded me of Central Park in NYC.||July 1, 2016

Jamie J||40||A beautiful and large Park, well worth a walk in the evening. Some people rented a Santander bike or were jogging. A must visit through along the lake towards Kensington Palace. ||July 1, 2016
jatindamani90||40||Large variety of Roses is found here. Many sculptures are also there. The park has various recreational activities like open water swimming, boating, cycling, tennis and horse riding. Many special events also take place here. A very good place for every day walk.||July 1, 2016
Amr-in-Langley||50||Rainy day, sunny day, windy day, an hot one or a cold one - doesn't matter, a walk in the Hyde Park is perhaps the most bracing one you will take in the middle of London. Something about Hyde Park that is unique is that it 'looks' so majestic - especially, when you walk from the Knightsbridge end and walk toward the Serpentine lake and bridge. Well, all have their favourite spots, ours is the one in the from to Serpentine lake and watch the ubiquitous tourists, swans and ducks, and over head in the far distant skies, the every present airliners making a bee line to Heathrow. Pure bliss.One can buy snacks from a number of good groceries around and hold a nice, memorable and absolutely beauty of a day out.||June 30, 2016
Marion V||40||Was there on an unusually warm/hot spring day... EVERYONE was out enjoying themselves. Fun but more crowded than I like for a park (think NYC Central Park). ||June 30, 2016
Kerri Z||50||My husband and I found this park completely by accident. We were just wandering around after seeing Buckingham Palace, and found ourselves here. I am so glad that we did. It is simply beautiful. We strolled through the park for a couple of hours, and didn't even get to see the whole thing! There are plenty of lovely spots to sit on relax- on a bench by the river, or in the shade under a tree. There are also very spacious areas to play sports or something of that nature. If you visit, be sure to find the Princess Diana memorial Garden- its the best place in the whole park. When we go back to London, we are definitely planning to go back here.||June 30, 2016
Lloyd J||40||Treated to a surprise weekend in London by my partner for my birthday. After a brief shopping trip we took a stroll through Hyde Park. We didn't realise that there was a Winter Wonderland event on. It was late November and the weather was a little colder than usual so we made our way around the food stalls to try and warm ourselves up. There was plenty to keep you entertained from the usual fairground attractions to the more popular adult alcohol tents that had a moving carousel bar. After a lap of the Winter Wonderland we headed out towards the far end of the Park before turning. Around and heading for the London Eye. The atmosphere was great, despite it being in London close to Christmas. It wasn't too crowded, there was plenty to keep you occupied. Very enjoyable, if a little chilly. ||June 30, 2016
PattieRS||50||Wish we'd had longer than an hour to spend in Hyde Park. We spent most of that time strolling down the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Walk. What a lovely place! The flowers were in full bloom, and it was a sight to behold. I love that the people living in the bustling city of London have such a wonderful green space to escape to. Enjoyed seeing the people walking their doggies. If you are a gardener or just love flowers, take a walk through here for a visual feast.||June 30, 2016
flyingrobin91||50||The park is the perfect place for a walk with your parter or friends. You can really smell some good fresh air.I like the whole area. A perfect day is made of a visit at one of the museums nearby, sonething to eat at one of the resturants close there and then a good walk in the park!||June 30, 2016
jclaire50||50||This is right next to my hotel Royal Garden here in London and is a wonderful park to sit and watch the world go by or have a wonderful stroll||June 30, 2016
ClaireB18||50||I love Hyde Park, there are so many paths that you can use to walk around it and as you do, you find hidden gems around the place. It's a beautiful space to walk around or to take a seat and reflect.||June 30, 2016
MikeK86||50||A beautiful walk and place to relax in central London. We walked through it several times over the course of our stay. Many memorials to various military organizations. The small restaurant at the east end of the park was nice. It over looked the Serpentine man made lake and the staff was very friendly.||June 30, 2016
gaysie2013||40||Hyde park is a beautiful refuge in LondonWe were lucky enough to get a very warm day to enjoy the parkThere was lots of people also enjoying the parkThe Calvary exercising there horses added to the pleasure ||June 30, 2016
Sherry P||50||We found ourselves wandering through Hyde Park with a friend who currently lives in London. Without his suggestion we never would have gone here. We are incredibly grateful we did. We had no idea how extensive the park is. We only explored a small portion ( our feet were killing us after two days of being tourists) but it was so peaceful. It is similar to Central Park in NYC but less congested. If you want a break from history and culture ( or shopping and the hustle and bustle of a vibrant urban center) come to Hyde Park. You may find the bucolic serenity just what you needed.||June 29, 2016
Ellen H||50||Hyde Park is large, but offers a bit of nature in the city - locals walking dogs, well behaved and leashed; fountains, monuments, a pleasant walk to Kensington Palace and Royal Albert Hall. ||June 29, 2016
JoshB999||50||Very charming park that is great for the whole family. Make sure to visit on a day that isn't too rainy... ||June 29, 2016

Stephanie D||40||We stayed in a hotel close to this park and walked here to have picnic & visit the zoo. It was a super nice park, a lot of people, a lot of bikes but a little confusing to get around. Great spot for pictures. ||June 29, 2016
vt132015||50||Hyde Park is an amazingly beautiful park. It is very big, there's so much you can do. We even got some bycicles to ride them through the park. The scenery is very beautiful. ||June 29, 2016
aliciaw1997||40||Myself and my partner went to Hyde Park for a relaxing picnic before we entered the busier parts of London and really enjoyed ourselves. There is the opportunity to hire deck-chairs and relax, go horse-riding and there is plenty to eat and drink. There are also lots of statues, lots of them memorials, which are great to get pictures with, as well as lots of little well-kept gardens.My only niggles would have to be the lack of toilets and the minimal maps around the place. We were planning to visit all of the statues but somehow ended up in Kensington gardens instead, so would've enjoyed a trail of some kind too. Perhaps that'd interest the kids as well too! A relaxing time overall though :) ||June 29, 2016
John Christophe... B||50||I could spend an entire day just wandering and people-watching in this beautiful park. Was lucky to spend the day in nice sunny weather (how often does that happen in London?)||June 28, 2016
Pamela G||50||Or jump on a bicycle or hire a boat. A great place for a picnic. A wonderful way to see Londoners enjoying themselves and tourists wearing out their legs. The ancient trees are a reinvigorating antidote to museums or shopping. ||June 28, 2016
MaryM9918||50||The views in Hyde Park are breathtaking, from birds to the water. There is a lot of room to walk and benches to sit down. You cannot visit London without stopping at Hyde Park.||June 28, 2016
moniquec874||50||To run, to rent a bike, to have a walk, to sit down and enjoy it - Hyde Park is an incredible place to spend the days. Beautiful, well preserved, as if it was photoshoped. ||June 28, 2016

tjhogan93||40||As far as parks go its great! There's lots of nice nature and animals to look at. The parks often got a lot of people there with ice cream vans and is lovely for a picnic with great vibes. However I do think there are better things to do in London than visit the parks. But for a park its great||June 28, 2016
dil345||40||We came here to take a walk in late June so were surprised to find out that most of the park is blocked off by tall walls. They are setting up for a big summer music festival in early July so there really was not much to see or walk through. I'm sure it is a nice place though.||June 28, 2016
amanda40671||40||We walked through Hyde Park on our way to Hyde Park Corner & were amazed by the size of it. Despite being busy due to the lovely weather there was still plenty of space to just wander. It was lovely to see so many people enjoying themselves.The gardens are well stocked & were a delight to walk through & smell the flowers. We also enjoyed seeing people feed the squirrels & pigeons.||June 28, 2016
RJRJMR||50||A great way to spend a day or a few hours. A relaxing place to stroll or people watch.The gardens are lovely and you might get a glimpse of The Royals !!||June 28, 2016
Caroline G||50||Spent a very pleasant afternoon here beautiful walks well kept and the people seem to respect its historical feelings! Great Cafe lovely to daydream in looking over the lake||June 28, 2016
michelle d||50||Hyde Park is so vast it's hard to believe you are still in the heart of London. great to strll around on a sunny day.||June 28, 2016
Rosemary P||50||There can be nothing wrong with spend a day walking about in Hyde Park...feeding the pigeons, looking out for the various types of birds, checking out the swans and ducks. The walk in spring is refreshing, best on a sunny day of course, but the sheer enormity of this delightful spot right in the heart of London is to say the least, exhilarating.||June 28, 2016
fahadvw||50||A great place for walking, relaxing, enjoying a cup of coffee. I recommend going to the Cafe and enjoy the view and lake.||June 28, 2016
karen n||50||We were lucky to get amazing weather while we were here and the park was buzzing with families and tourists .. my main love of this place is that I was able to sit and feed / watch / play with squirrils .. I was so excited. But I also loved strolling through the park with hubby ... we were in no hurry and able to enjoy the sunshine and to just sit and enjoy our surroundings||June 27, 2016
HEGAZI||50||HydePark is lovely either day or night time it always amazing, go there hire a boat with friends definitely or your partner and make a shot||June 27, 2016
Marcus A||40||I went at sunny day so everything was pretty. A lot of animals turn the lake a place to seat and spend some time just observing. Peaceful.||June 27, 2016
FlashJordan1||40||As much as the park is beautiful (lots of wildlife and 3 man made lakes) it's also pretty big. Being a shortcut from our hotel to the museums we spent a lot of time walking though it....The only issue we had was the large amount of bikes who would be on the pedestrian only paths... Bit of a pain to move out of the way of someone on a bike when they shouldn't be there!But ignoring that, there's a lot to see in the park, such as the palace and the Queen Victoria statute along with the many performances, protests and (if you're lucky) people giving out free wine!||June 27, 2016
Ghadeer N||50||Gardens in London are part of the urban structure. I enjoyed a walk through the Hyde park that hosted loads of tourists. Wonderful seen overlooking the water can be also enjoyed while having a drink. ||June 27, 2016
ionsis||50||Loved the greenery. The cafe right beside the water is great. it was such a nice evening, sitting and watching the boats, the ducks, the people and enjoying the good weather.||June 27, 2016
navamed||50||Required to reach the Park. If this experience pleasant weather. We spent a whole day in the Park between the ducks and squirrels on the lawns of a magical place.||June 27, 2016
Niki C||50||This is without a doubt, my favorite part of London. I could spend hours walking through this park, sitting down watching the ducks, finding the Peter Pan statue. I love being able to leave the craziness and find peace in this park. It's great for everyone. When my kids were little, we would go feed the ducks every morning when we were here. This trip they played soccer in the park. I wish we stayed as close this time as we did last time to the park. This is worth finding and taking your time to walk through.||June 27, 2016
703sharih||50||Loved walking through this park, especially coming across Kensington Palace where the young royals reside. It's beautiful, well maintained and peaceful. Lots of people utilize the park, and you can tell it brings joy to everyone.||June 27, 2016
313globetrotter||30||Another icon for the tourists in the yesteryears. The park is still attractive and well maintained. The SPEAKERS CORNER seems to loose it's shine and attract less audiences. One would expect more activities with the BREXIT issue!!! Good relaxing place for a nice walk BUT not on a RAINING DAY !!!||June 27, 2016
ilovetheopenroad||50||This huge park in the middle of London is a lovely escape from the busy city streets. Kensington Palace is at one end of it and there is also a lake, I think you can hire boats here but not sure. Definitely worth visiting||June 27, 2016
Glenn M||50||A good nice place to visit on a hot summers day. be it walking down the canal or walking through the parks to just having a nap in the park to sun bathing. Its always busy and has loads of visitors everyday.||June 27, 2016
LE0A16||50||A massive and beautiful green space in the heart of London. It was a great place to go for a run. Was only there for about an hour to get some exercise in before the day, but seemed huge and a much needed reprieve from the coldness of urban life.||June 26, 2016
wearenotstupid||50||This is a fantastic parkThe swans were fantastic to seeThe people really love this park and keep it very clean||June 26, 2016

Stewart M||50||If the weather is good, you are close and need to break away from the bustle of the city a stroll through any part of Hyde park would be ideal, with lots of areas, wildlife, water features, sculptures, statues there is plenty for a romantic stroll. Definatley worth seeking out the Diana memorials, Peter Pan statue and some of the gallery's that are dotted around.||June 26, 2016
Jen S||50||Lovely, green, and well kept. Excellent on a sunny day in London. I would recommend the boating late.||June 26, 2016

palmpirate||50||Hyde Park is huge and there is always something going on apart from enjoying the park itself. There is a lovely stroll through an 'English country Garden' section near the Wellington Arch end as you go towards The Serpentine. We made a stop for lunch there, sheltered from a light drizzle that set in. Plenty mature trees meant the canopy formed a tunnel across the path and we had a pleasant walk back following Rotten Row.||June 25, 2016
Michelle S||50||London has amazing parks. This one did not disappoint! Huge park with something for everyone. Roses were in bloom when we were there and so lovely. Swans, geese, pigeons are so tame they walk right up to you. Bike paths aren't clearly marked so I didn't rent bikes for my kids, scared we'd run someone over. All in all another gem in the city. Great place to decompress after a day of being a tourist!||June 25, 2016
Delia C||50||Quite a big park and amazing views. He's gardens are full of roses,a lovely relaxing place where you can hide from all the noise and rush that London has .||June 25, 2016

food-snobber||40||London's biggest park offers visitors a chance to get "lost" and experience a wilderness that is seldom found in big cities.||June 24, 2016
chrisswifte||40||Loved our time at the park, we hired some bikes and explored, thought you could do more bike paths, a lot of areas are not for cycling but we covered the park and enjoyed Kensington Palace and the Lady Di Memorial, awesome park.||June 24, 2016
zephanjavh||50||Such a beautiful park! We rented bikes one day, but were surprised to find that many of the paths are inaccessible to bikes. Pedestrians are the priority in this park. The Lido restaurant was very good, and it was lovely to sit by the lake and enjoy a casual lunch.||June 24, 2016
Mazmannan||50||Hyde Park is a large open park in London. It covers around 350 acres. It was opened to the general public nearly 400 years ago. You can take a boat on the Serpentine lake or go swimming. There are ducks and swans.On a sunny day, many people come out to picnic in the park. The park is famous for the Speakers Corner where many people have made their speeches. As a tribute to the late Diana, Princess of Wales - there is a memorial fountain.On the eastern side of the Serpentine is the Serpentine Bar & Kitchen. It serves a range of hot meals and snacks, salads and sandwiches. There are also some tempting cakes in the bakery and drinks in the bar.On the southern side of the Serpentine near the Diana memorial fountain is the Lido Cafe Bar which is a nice place to have a rest on the outdoor seating. The facilities include toilets too.If you have time, you should visit the Rose Garden which is in the south east corner of the park, near Hyde Park Corner. The Garden opened in 1994 and is a popular place to visit especially during the early part of summer when it is a good time to see the roses. The Rose Garden has a rather grandiose pergola.Many cyclists and joggers can be seen in the park too.||June 24, 2016
CierraBrooklyn||50||A beautiful and relaxing opportunity to walk through a tranquil garden. Beautiful fountains, Kensington as well as the Princess Diana Memorial. A bit rainy and cold but the walk was wonderful.||June 23, 2016
hop1985||50||Get their early before the crowds get too crazy. The exhibit is so well organized and designed and takes you through an enormous about of materials and information in a very dynamic way. One of the best tourist spots - I highly recommend it.||June 23, 2016
Bob S||50||Swans, Ducks, Geese and so much more here to gaze at as long as you wish. However the local government frowns upon feeding the animals.||June 23, 2016
KenmareLisa||50||A very nice way to spend your day or just for a walk through. There is everything you'll need for a day of fun in this park, from rest rooms, to food and drink, a pond to feed the ducks and lawn chairs to rent (1.60 per hour). You can visit The Serpentine sculpture, Princess Diana's Fountain or listen to music on the weekends. A great family day out. and oh yes, its completely FREE!||June 23, 2016
PaulT913||30||They need a few sheep to keep the grass under control. A lot of walking through this place but the paths are very smooth and flat.||June 23, 2016
anandsrivastava||50||Glorious weather, the park was at its best. I suppose paradise would be like this. Lovely trees,great rolling open spaces. Nice eating places too.The only complaint- not enough wash rooms.England should learn from USA about this. A.K. Srivastava||June 23, 2016
karachimom||50||One visit is simply not enough to enjoy this park and all that it has to offer.

C T||40||We were able to walk to this park from our hotel, which was a nice benefit as the traffic around here can be very congested. We visited on a overcast day, yet still very pretty and great to people watch. I understand this may be the largest park in London. This park was next to Kensington Gardens and Palace.||June 22, 2016
smcnulty82||50||Beautiful park, went peddle boating on the lake. Can't wait to go back and explore more of the park. Couldn't get over the size of the park ||June 22, 2016

Bernadettegriffith||50||We stayed across the road from the Park and there was beautiful sunshine so a walk in the park was perfect. What a beautiful park - so much to see - from varied wildlife to some amazing art work/studies too. Well worth a visit should you have time.||June 22, 2016
samantha p||50||Hyde park is a fabulous green space and nature in abundance....

Ducks and swans and deck chairs!!!bliss....||June 22, 2016
VM94||50||You step through one of the gates into the park and you can breath again. You aren't being pushed along in a tide of humanity. There are some statues and fountains to keep it interesting, wide paths to follow, squirrels and birds and well behaved dogs to watch also ducks and swans in the ponds. Grass and trees are plentiful and splashes of colour with the flower gardens.Visit for a long time or just take a breather it is worth it.||June 22, 2016
Gaurav S||50||This park is huge and gives you a feel of close to nature in the mid of the city. The oark has got everything. Huge gardens, trees, walk ways, cafes, lake. You can do boating at the lake. cycling in the park, sun bathing||June 22, 2016
Vegetarian4ever||50||Green grass for miles, swans on the lake, Squirrels running along the paths, sit on a bench and relax, watch people feed the birds on the lake, stretch your legs. go see the fountain or just take it easy. Good escape from the busy city!||June 21, 2016
PJ L||40||We walked around in the park for about 2 hours and went to the Princess Diana memorial fountain. The park was easy to access from Paddington Station. I would recommend this destination if ever in London and you need a bit of a break.||June 21, 2016

RichaRaiBhatia||40||The lake view was the best part, apart from the lush green open huge park of green grass. We enjoyed little drizzles when there.||June 21, 2016
Sarah D||50||Hyde Park is an amazing getaway from the hustle and bustle of London. While it is quite lively on nice afternoons with plenty of people, it is still very serene and calming. Paddle and row boat rentals are available on the Serpentine and bike rental stations are located all along the edges of the park. We really enjoyed renting a paddle boat and then grabbing some drinks to relax with on the grass. The rental bikes are also a great way to get up to Kensington Palace to see it and the gardens. We rented them right outside the Hyde Park Corner tube station one morning and biked along the designated path up to Kensington, where we returned them. I would definitely recommend spending at least part of a nice day strolling around the park.||June 21, 2016
John F||50||A lovely place to get away from the noise and bustle of London. Fifty steps into the park and you are surrounded by peace and quiet and the calming sight of English parkland.||June 21, 2016

888Thedisneygirl||50||I love coming here. I would get off the train one stop early just to walk through the park. The previous time I was there a young man sat in the dusk on a bench next to a street lamp and as I passed him i saw he was sketching hands. Practicing his technique repeatedly. What a nice place it must be to live in where a park like that is just part of you daily life?||June 21, 2016
903duygua||50||Great park, perfect for a walk even in rainy whether. There are no lights, I think it may be too dark at night.||June 21, 2016
Lauren H||40||On a lovely sunny day, a walk around Hyde Park or a ride on a Boris Bike is the perfect way to spend the day! There are a couple of little food huts to grab a coffee or ice-cream, makes for a lovely day!||June 21, 2016
Gehrig S||50||After a long day of business meetings, my cares and stress peeled away as I walked through Hyde Park. By the time I reached the big pond, I was smiling as I watched the ducks||June 20, 2016
Chris D||50||Having stayed in Kensington, it is impossible not to be drawn towards the green belt area of London. One can escape the hustle and bustle of sightseeing London by simply strolling through Hyde Park and taking time out to recover. Amazingly you are really only minutes away from central London. My wife and I enjoyed walking through Hyde Park and others on our way into the city.||June 20, 2016
raghupalat||50||The Hyde Park is a beautiful place to relax. One can go rowing on the Serpentine or just relax and have a picnic. Speakers Corner is worth a visit - seeing persons put forth their thoughts on all kinds of things.||June 20, 2016
doilynm||50||Hyde Park has a charm which not other park that I have been to has. It is the largest park I've ever visited. So mesmerizing and beautiful that I just couldn't have enough. I spent a couple of hours and it would have only been a fraction of the enormous park. I'm in love with it and would definitely recommend it to all.||June 20, 2016
alexkV9270EF||50||Been here 100s of times and there is always something new to see. A very beautiful and well organised park with loads to do. Take a pedal boat in the lake, go for a walk, see the prince albert memorial etc etc||June 20, 2016
Island-Mavericks||50||We went out for a romantic ride on a paddle boat in Hyde Park. The first photo was taken at the start of our little excursion. As you can see, we are all smiles. The second photo shows us being towed back in....never underestimate high winds and strong currents. Thank goodness for the recovery boat!||June 20, 2016
DiogoMM||40||Go for a troll in the park and enjoy the beauty of it. Find the Peter Pan statue or the Diana Memorial.||June 20, 2016
Mark G||30||We visited in June 2016 and it was part of the day out. It was nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city life. Its free to get in and you can take a picnic, ride your bike, get refreshment, relax or just people watch. Speakers corner is always good to go to if you want to liven up the day where people voice their opinion on anything and everything. ||June 20, 2016
Helen H||40||Absolutely beautiful park, Serpentine lake in desperate need of a good clean near the Wine bar/bistro (not the one at the bottom of the lake) as we sat to have wine and had a view of masses of scum, reeds, feathers etc next to the bistro tables which was a little smelly and swarming with gnats.||June 20, 2016
768derekm||40||Hyde park is beautiful and large enough that you might forget you're in a major city. There are a number of birds that are always around The Serpentine. There's a cafe near the SE entrance of the park that sells food and beer/wine. Grab a glass (or two) of wine and watch the sunset over The Serpentine! ||June 20, 2016
HelMelMelbourne||40||Plenty to see in this huge park and a decent walk if you like to get out in the fresh air, or just sit on a bench and watch the passing parade||June 19, 2016
Shukitty||50||We had to kill a good four hours after our flight before the hotel would let us in. We spent the time wandering around Hyde park and still only got about s third of it covered. The sculpture installation at serpentine gallery is really cool! Lots of nice shady benches to rest in as well.||June 19, 2016
pollyoppy||40||A large park with plenty of space for walking, jogging, picnicking etc. A lovely green space to get away from the crowds.||June 19, 2016
Jullsd84||50||I stayed at the Hilton hotel overlooking this park so it was only natural for me to check it out and sure enough I wasn't disappointed. It's a really huge park leading to adjoining parks as well. There's a lot to see and appreciate about the park, and if you're looking for a quiet and serene place to just sit and relax, you can't go wrong with this park either. Except if you have all the time in the world, I wouldn't try to hike the park. There are City bike rentals right at the entrance to the park and they cost only £2 for the whole day if I remember correctly (very affordable for London, I know right?). You can ride around at your own pace with intermittent stops to enjoy the park from different points. I had fun biking around and taking pictures.||June 19, 2016
heyw0rths||50||The park is huge, be prepared to yomp, you will be rewarded, Diana memorial is nice for a splash, great for kids, nice for picnic, if you like a swim Serpentine is great. Family ticket very reasonable, not too cold, watch out for the goose do-do though, there is a lot of it about, not in the water though, thankfully, which was fresh but not too bad today. Nice play and paddle area for little kids at club and changing and toilets too.||June 19, 2016
avjcan77||50|| Hyde Park is an amazing park. The flowers were incredible. Many things were still in bloom. It is a very large park almost 6 km around. Perfect for walking, cycling. Very safe. Highly recommend.||June 19, 2016

TravellerMan72||30||I have always wanted to see Hyde Park and I did. It's very huge with artificial lake, many plants, birds and other species. As well, as restaurant. It's mostly flat and it can't be any better than in May!May is the best to visit Hyde Park, in such a nice sunny day, just relax, watch the green, people and enjoy the fresh clean air away from the city hussle.||June 19, 2016
Eyrun J||40||I had just been at Harrods and got a massive headache, so I decided to walk to Hyde Park! It was truly a escape from the noisy city! I could not believe how relaxing and quiet it was! I would definitely recommend taking a walk in the park on your trip to London, it does not feel like it's in the middle of a large city!||June 19, 2016
Sea E||50||Hyde Park offers us always a place to be relaxed. Wonderful open air experience after the busy streets of London. We can spend there hours: stopping for refreshments by the lake, enjoying the vista. Kids and dogs can run free in some parts of the park.||June 19, 2016
Jneyc||50||I was suffering a little bit from too much to drink the night before and my friend bought a couple of takeaway coffees and brought me to Hyde Park where we sat on a bench, sipped our coffee and watched the world go by for an hour. It's a brilliant spot for people watching and just generally chilling out. Afterwards, we strolled through the park, took beautiful pictures of the wildlife (so many squirrels!), the Elfin Tree, the buildings and gardens. It was the perfect way to spend a morning on a bright and dry day.||June 19, 2016
oberd2000||50||When you enter Hyde Park from Marble Arch and see the huge green area you feel free. The Serpentine (lake) is huge and beautiful and the "flower garden" extraordinary impressing.||June 19, 2016
Suewoody23||50||Stayed on New Year's Eve in a hotel opposite an entrance and could honestly say I have never really walked around Hyde park which we did on New Year's Day. The entrance was used in mr selfridge and is a lovely walk through to the lake and towards Harrods. The nature and plants are beautifully maintained and could spend several hours there as you do not feel you are in the London rush! Several species of birds who are happy to sit at your hand with squirrels running past at the same time. This park is so large and varied, walked towards the serpentine gallery which is amazing too.A must visit when you want to avoid the crowds! Also visited the winter wonderland at night which was amazing too.||June 19, 2016
Kevo1978||40||Spent an hour pedalling on the Serpentine whilst the wife put her feet up! Loads of people there enjoying the sun and taking a leisurely stroll - £24 for a hour on a pedalo is a bit steep though! Can grab and ice cream or cold beer and even take a swim in the sectioned pool area over the far side.. Nice afternoon out if your feeling a little active! ||June 19, 2016
Lawerance P||40||It is a huge park with almost everything for everyone. It is quiet and peaceful yet you can find people can engage in various activities without affecting each other.||June 18, 2016
Tomme T||50||Must visit when in London.Great place to visit to relax and enjoy some fresh air. Plenty of greens and animals to enjoy and watch. Great for adults and kids to just wander and explore.Spent around 2 hours here early in the morning and enjoyed a peaceful walk around the Serpentine before the tourist groups arrive. There are 2 cafes along the way, which were perfect for a coffee or snack break.Also recommend passing by the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain along the way for a quick visit.||June 18, 2016
BrowsingRoadside||50||A large beautiful park with many different paths to take, things to see, cafes to sit at and stare out a the beautiful scenery. ||June 18, 2016
Westyhammy||50||Hyde Park will always be so special to us as my Grandson Passed out for the Blues and Royals and did a parade for us in Hyde Park, he had never ridden a horse and after 14 weeks training did this wonderful display in Hyde Park||June 18, 2016
TheDreamLasVegas||40||Lovely park to walk and observe nature, watch locals working with their pets and a short cut to Harrod's on the other side of the park. Kensington Garden, horseback riding, paddle boats on the lake are all available. ||June 18, 2016
GreatTrue||30||A very big park and was great to see all the people, cycling, rolller skating, walking and simply being outside. The children parks were a hit with my daughter. ||June 18, 2016
Mark R||40||This park reminds me of Central Park in New York. The park is very large, and provides a great escape from the metropolis surrounding. You can come by to play football, or just relax in the grass or have a bite to eat.Although the park does not enjoy the great location or attention of St. James Park, this huge park is a great place to stop by and enjoy an afternoon.Also, you can visit the Marble Arch and a few other great memorials nearby.||June 18, 2016
Braeburn33||50||Spent a lovely day here last summer with family. Little ones loved the lake area and seeing the ducks. Perfect spot to enjoy the outdoors.||June 18, 2016
Isa C||50||I love coming here.. It's a bit of heaven on earth! Children playing, elderly people chatting, and kindness around. Just perfect||June 17, 2016
Thomas G||40||Hyde Park is home to many species of British pigeons such as the Columba Livia and Columba Palumbus. Bird watchers will be right at home here as Hyde Park is home to many statues and monuments; a popular spot for Rock Doves to deposit egesta discharge. However they are are also known to perform this intriguing avian ritual across the entire park.||June 17, 2016
Illinirog70||40||We walked the park from south to north on a warm summers day. It is a beautiful walk filled with nature.||June 17, 2016
jujubean4||40||The part we visited was mostly a lake with a walking path. Not much landscaping to speak of. There are a few free park benches, but you must rent a chair to sit.||June 17, 2016
Ezyan N||50||The place is nearby the iconic London Eye and also The Big Ben. Suitable for joggers and if you're a nature lover, this is the place for you. The scenery is just incredible. Lot of wild birds and i bump into this friendly squirrel. Amazing!||June 17, 2016
Alibu6||40||Just a few minutes from the buzz of London you are whisked away to a green haven. Plenty of paths and monuments to see. We were amazed at the number of breeds of birds, keep your eyes (and ears) open.||June 16, 2016

f9saunders||40||Hyde Park was near our hotel, and I had some time after arriving to walk the grounds on a Sunday afternoon. It was a treat to watch families playing on the grounds and viewing the formal gardens right near the shopping and hotels in this part of London. ||June 16, 2016
agrawalrsachin||50||A visit to London without numerous visits to Hyde park, is incomplete! Right from the sculpture at Marble Arch, to the serpentine lake, and the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, the verdant greenery and large trees fill your lungs with fresh air in the middle of London. Take a boat ride on the lake, with not so expensive memoir pics taken by the staff at the shop! Pony riding is also available but we didn't get a chance to do that as we were pretty late for it.Leisure, romance, activity - this place has it all. Undoubtedly one of the best urban oases i have experienced ||June 16, 2016
alexyeck||40||Centrally located, this is a good place to just sit down on the grass, relax, and watch the world go by. Speakers' Corner is just nearby so if you fancy a go at public speaking or discussion, you are most welcomed to do so||June 16, 2016
JessTanxx||50||Hyde Park is very beautiful, and is the perfect location for a nice stroll, especially during sunny weather. It's very easy to get to, being located in the heart of London and is accessible via a number of underground stations - Queensway, Lancaster Gate, Marble Arch, Hyde Park corner, and Knightsbridge - depending on what part of Hyde Park you want to visit. There are some great things to see in Hyde Park, including the speakers corner (close to Marble Arch stop), the Diana, Princess of Wales memorial, the holocaust memorial, the 7 July Memorial, and a number of interesting sculptures throughout. Hyde Park is a must-see for anyone visiting London!||June 16, 2016
briancF7218ZM||50||Walking through London's Hyde Park and onto the icon Kennington Gardens is a morning or afternoon experience you shouldn't miss. There is so much to see here and to marvel at - many moments to sit and reflect. Another great day in London.||June 15, 2016

100caroline_||50||Hyde park is absolutely huge, you can walk for ages around the park. Good for cycling or walking, in the summer months sometimes there are outside concerts, and in the winter it hosts winter wonderland and German market. Also there's a boating lake and lovely big cafe on the water, and of course the beautiful princess Diana memorial right by the serpentine. Great for picnics on a lovely sunny day or just sit by the waters edge of the memorial and paddle your feet.||June 15, 2016
AlbertSalichs||50||Hyde Park is one of the best parks and probably the best known in London, but not the biggest one. It is located in Kensington zone and the best known part of the park is the speaker’s corner, where everyone can speak about everything (it is a one of the places, where you can understand the freedom of UK).Moreover, it is a very beautiful park, where you can relax, sit down on the grass, walk during hours, see other people and the trees, or eat something. Really it is the perfect site to rest after you go to the noisy surroundings, especially Oxford street. An essential visit in London.Goodbye Papa!||June 15, 2016
Matúš P||50||Hyde park is great place for chillin walking runing or just enjoing of the nature in the middle of big city. Serves lot of paths for walking and lot of beautiful places for watching. If you would like to turn off your body you have to enter to the Hyde park.||June 15, 2016
JaniceLACA||50||We took a walk through the park and strolled through all the gardens and attractions. Had a fabulous time!||June 15, 2016
janeleung||50||Jogging inside is a very relaxing experience. The park is big enough to exercise (5KM a loop), and there are always runner beside you. I saw children having horse ridding lessons in the park and i enjoyed watching them. There are serval water drinking facilities. ||June 15, 2016
texastravelers30||50||After our tea at the Orangery, we walked across Hyde Park. The skies were typically dark and low that afternoon. The beauty of the park, the statues and the fountains reverberated through our day. For our first afternoon in London, this was an excellent transition to begin our vacation. You can rent a boat and paddle on the pond. Since it was cold, we weren't able to do that this time. Something to put on my plan for next time.||June 15, 2016
srinnantwich||50||I absolutely love Hyde park.Every time I come to London I always get a chance to have a jog around the park.Worked out from my hotel, that I can achieve a half marathon if I run this twice and include the serpentine lake.Views are stunning..||June 15, 2016
ashishd131||50||A huge property right at the heart of London. I went there with my family including two small children. One could relax by the lake and kids can play by themselves with limited oversight. You plan a picnic for a group or whatever.||June 15, 2016

cev620||50||We came to Hyde Park every morning of our trip. Rented bikes from the kiosk (minimal fee, free if you return within 30 mins) and just enjoyed the stunning surroundings. Do not miss this in your visit! Highly recommend Diana's Memorial Fountain, something about it is truly magical. Bring a picnic, relax and you'll fall in love with this place.||June 15, 2016
MrsM-330||50||Spent about an hour walking through and is a fabulous Park, plenty to see and very clean unfortunately due to time constraints it wasn't as long as i would have liked. I will be back to explore further in the future.||June 14, 2016
sabtis99||50||Very clean, well kept park. Chairs for relaxing on are available at a cost. But worth just sitting there and enjoying being there.We thoroughly loved the park. Bird and people watching. Some of the park we didn't get to. ||June 14, 2016

davkd||50||If you are visiting London and you are all 'shopped out' and feeling like a break from the hustle and bustle just enter Hyde Park and feel the stress just melt away!There is a boating lake, some beautiful scenery to take in and lots of nice areas to sit and chill.With deckchairs to hire and plenty of room for the kids to play this is a tranquil place which is also full of monuments, little secluded gardens and plenty of places to explore.||June 14, 2016
Meri V||40||If you are full of the big city and want to go relax in the park this is place to go. There is grass and you can go there and have a picnic or you can also rent a boat and go on the lake. There is a lot of different kind of birds and flowers to explore.||June 14, 2016
Annphilomenaceceliaj||50||Beautiful and relaxing park on the doorstep of a busy city. Plenty of places to have a quiet sit down and to have a coffee or something to eat.||June 14, 2016
Linda M||50||Been to London a dozen times but never had the chance to experience Hyde Park in the SUNSHINE! A beautiful, relaxing way to get away from the city without ever leaving it. Picnic or eat at the restaurant on the Long Water. ||June 14, 2016
Ben K||40||I have been to Hyde Park every time I come to London, you can find many interesting things to see and it is a great walk. I suggest starting at Hyde Park Corner or Marble Arch underground station and having a look at the map at the park entrances to decide what you want to see. When starting at Hyde Park corner you can walk along the Serpentine lake which turns into Long Water as you progress into Kensington Gardens, then walk back on the other side. This takes you past a lot of things to see, the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, Peter Pan's statue, the Italian Gardens etc. Depending on how much you want to see, this can take 2 hours or more, but is well worth it.||June 14, 2016
dgosul||50||This park is just so big, it takes ages to walk through, it's a pity it rained at the weekend as it would have looked even nicer in the sunshine, must return when it's not raining.||June 13, 2016
laurapapagheorghe||50||I have not enough words to say how beautiful and huge this park is. We went for a stroll in a park and we found ourselves in what seemed like a forest. The spaces are very wide, everything is very well kept. A tour around the lake is very relaxing. There are also many types of birds around the lake. Be sure to visit the Diana of Wales memorial, the Prince Albert Monument and enjoy the overall beautifullness of this park.||June 13, 2016
debsmillen66||40||Amazing park in the middle of the city.Peaceful and relaxing ...met at Speakers Corner, but continued into the park until we were by the Serpentine where we sat and had a picnic.Great....a must see!!||June 13, 2016

Txterrilc||50||Be sure to see - Serpentine Lake, Speaker's corner, Peter Pan Statue, Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain (beautiful), Animals in War Memorial, and so much more! Kensington Palace is in the park (over by Notting Hill). Queen Victoria is brought up here. You can learn all about his childhood and life.There are so many things to see in this park so be sure and get a map so you don't miss anything!||June 13, 2016
Techno-TTT||50||Spent a whole morning strolling through Hyde Park after arriving the night before at Paddington Station. You could be in the countryside the park is so beautiful. Well kept, cosmopolitan, with plenty to interest all. Kensington palace, Italian fountains, joggers, cyclists, horses, sculptures, wild life.||June 13, 2016
AdamsK24||50||We just came back from London and we loved Hyde Park. We stayed in Paddington so it was only a short walk away.It was well signposted, very clean and all staff very helpful.Café in the park itself was relatively expensive for a sandwich and some crisps but I think that was to be expected.Great park also used by locals as much as visitors.||June 13, 2016
markcA6953DV||50||Had a great stroll through the beautifully kept Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens on the weekend of the Queens 90th. Had a treat of watching the RAF fly past whilst enjoying an ice cream. Always amazed the wildlife that crops up from parakeet to Herons and brazen squirrels! ||June 13, 2016
Michael M||40||As our hotel was walking distance we had nice stroll the afternoon we arrived from long flight.Parks don't change so much but guess it's another place you have to see||June 13, 2016
Maria M||50||To really appreciate everything there is to see at this beautiful park, take a whole day and walk all the way from the Marble Arch down to Kensington Palace. It will take a few hours to do the walk and back but you wont regret it. It's a magnificent park with lots to see. Pick a nice sunny day and enjoy like I did. ||June 13, 2016

sc120||50||I went running in the park while my hotel was in the Paddington area. The park was large, open and nicely manicured. Lots of birds and swans in the water areas. Nice fountains. Overall an enjoyable time. Would recommend if you need a break from the hustle of the city. ||June 12, 2016
DaPure1||50||The park was just across across the street from our hotel. As we passed it in our travels we would see people walking, jogging, and riding bicycles there. One night missed our stop from the hop on/off tour bus and decided to walk through the park and it was very nice. Plenty of open space and pathways for those driving and those walking or biking. There were also some benches to sit along the way to just sit and enjoy the scenery.||June 12, 2016
CS_Perth||50||Our daughter loved it. There are such lovely plantings and flowers, huge meadows, water, trees and quiet and space. Visit the Lido for a bite to eat or drink.||June 11, 2016
Madeleine R||50||We popped into the Hyde Park gardens on the way to the National Gallery and it was such a lovely little detour. The flowers are blooming and we had beautiful sunshine. Just so lovely to take a little break from the hustle of the city for a little while!||June 11, 2016
Helldogger||50||Hyde Park is truly a wonderful garden for Londoners. We hire bikes to travel through the Park and saw so many people enjoying its delights.||June 11, 2016
Daniela K||50||I walked the entire length of Hyde Park by accident. I checked the map and it looked manageable to reach Buckingham Palace from the area we stayed just North of Kensington Gardens. Yes, it is doable, but I do not recommend it. Hyde Park is far larger than one would expect for a park in the middle of a city, and that is partially because Hyde Park did not used to be part of the city exactly. It was on the outskirts. Now, it is surrounded by bus and Tube stops. You can take a walk, bring a stroller, bring a dog, ride a bike, shoot photography, really the park has so many lovely facets to it that there is something for everyone and I recommend visiting it to take a break from the intensity of London. It was such a peaceful area, and a really wonderful combination of carefully landscaped but somewhat rustic. We walked there most days and absolutely loved it. ||June 10, 2016
harryzach||50||It's refreshing to see so much well-maintained greenery in the heart of London, and this makes the park popular for tourists and locals alike. There's plenty to do here - boating on the Serpentine, a picnic on the grass, a stroll around the park, roller-skating, cycling with either a Santander Cycle or your own bike...the list goes on. There are also often exhibitions and events going on around the park, which it would be worth checking.||June 10, 2016
Raffdura||50||Hyde Park is beautiful and huge. The Italian garden/fountain is my favorite area, but walk the whole thing!||June 10, 2016
GinaTucker||50||Genuinely a great place to spend an afternoon. Plenty of space to walk and explore, you can rent bikes too. There are also small boats to paddle around in the pond, perfect for couples. There is a cafe that offers really tasty treats and beverages. Really, if you're looking for something low key to do one day, Hyde Park is great! ||June 10, 2016
choccylady||50||Lovely to wander through up to the Italian fountains, all the wildlife especially the little squirrels are quite tame, plenty places to have a coffee or use the loos, we spent a lovely day here||June 10, 2016
Elaine T||50||Lovely relaxing park. The sun was shining so a walk through the park was great, lots of different birds on the water. Ideal for families.||June 10, 2016
Seasonedtravellers82||40||An excellent park to stroll around on a sunny day taking in The Serpentine and Italian Gardens. A very pleasant way to spend a few hours and relax. Well worth the visit.||June 10, 2016
Kieran D||50||Hyde park is a must see as it is a tranquil part of London, you can relax and it is not overcrowded. I fully recommend that you bring your own food and drink as anywhere round there will be expensive. I will always advise people to walk from Marble Arch as you will be at the better end of the park, The only time to avoid is winter wonderland||June 10, 2016
Loment||50||If you run around Hyde and Kensington Park it's exactly 7 km! Perfect for an early morning jog in the heart of the city - truly recommended||June 10, 2016
Vicky M||50||great place for a leisurely, relaxing stroll. Watch out for the bicyclists though...some were quite rude...keep to the designated pedestrian paths and you'll be okay.||June 10, 2016

M.j. A||50||Beautiful Park in heart of the city of London. You also can say Central Park. It's better to visit in a sunny warm day. Also there is a festival at the beginning of winter called " Winter Wonderland". It's very exciting.I highly recommend this park. ||June 9, 2016
hanny303||50||We walked around Hyde Park, and it really is lovely especially on a sunny day. Amazing views for a pinic too. Lovely wildlife around, swans are beautiful. ||June 9, 2016
Greta K||30||Nothing special. Just a quite large park. Did probably have too high expectations. But it was good for bird watching :-)||June 8, 2016
Dean_Porte||50||Great Park but not the best, nonetheless the it is worth a visit with friends or a special partner or even on u r own with a great book as it's a big old park. But I would say go to Richmond Park for the best park in London.||June 8, 2016
VeryWellTraveledGuy||40||Probably a tourist thing to do, but if you want to see 200 pigeons try to attack your 11 and 12 year old, this is the place. In all seriousness, incredibly beautiful, you can see the dog and fitness culture of London in full swing. We stayed in Notting Hill so this was a near-daily hit while we were in London. ||June 8, 2016
QC-CDNtraveller||50||The park is huge and a visit to Princess Diana's memorial, simple but well designed is worth a visit. Flowers, walk path, nice spot for a picnic.||June 8, 2016
zsoke||40||Why? because it is so beautiful and is just by the metro station (Piccadilly Line on one side, Central Line on the other side). With the gardens, with the lake, fountains. You can also see skaters showing their talent off-pretty cool sometimes; you can cycle-on land and in the lake-for prices see the photos of my review. You get food, there are toilets.A mysterious-cool tree (weeping beech) where you can hide under the branches...even if I haven't seen any playground for kids, you and the family will enjoy a day here, laying on the grass, enjoying the sun.||June 8, 2016
smezzy||50||I adore Hyde park - for me it's perfect in all seasons as you can see the changes in both the flora and also the people who enjoy hide park. We've taken one of the little boats on the serpentine twice and adored it! Take food aboard and paddle around. ||June 8, 2016
irishguy1986||50||Just walked through here while on a visit to London. A very nice park and very relaxing in the sun. Great contrast to the busy areas surrounding it. Definitely worth a visit.||June 7, 2016
JellyrollsKaren||50||I spent a lovely morning exploring Hyde Park. I started down in the corner of the park closest to Buckingham Palace, and wandered through the park all the way to Kensington Palace. Some of my favorite spots in the park were: 1. The pond where people were out swimming laps even on a 50 degree morning. 2. The Princess Diana Memorial Fountain--it was truly a wonderful tribute to the People's Princess.3. The Peter Pan statue--just adorable4. The Italian Fountains--really prettyGive yourself plenty of time to see and enjoy the park.||June 7, 2016
fringetraveller987||50||To have a sit on the grass and relax in the bustle of London is a treat. I love the park. It is a bit rough around the edges but very safe.||June 7, 2016
jaszen||40||Hyde Park is lovely to sit in on a warm day. There's plenty of space to walk round and it's extremely central.||June 7, 2016
Rainbowtravelgirl||40||Sunny day to do a power nap by the green field of Hyde Park. This is my 4th time to be in London and was a joy to lay down lazily after a midday walking around. Water fountain is around. Picnicking people around. Glorious !||June 7, 2016
José R||50||Hyde Park is really huge and you can spend a entire day there if you want. The park is different from some places to another, and my favourite part is the Italian Gardens, right at the exit of the Lancaster Gate tube. However, if you want to be surrounded by people and feel a bit of energy, usually the parts of the park at the exit of Marble Arch or Hyde Park corner are usually more crowded||June 7, 2016
AMD805||40||Wow what a lovely park we spent a full day here! we walked around the serpentine lake, Italian gardens, Diana's memorial fountain, Albert's memorial and the Peter pan statue. All of which where beautiful and worth the walk on a beautiful sunny day take a picnic, read a book take games, go for a jog, watch the world go by something for everyone!||June 7, 2016
fleckhunter||50||Very pleasant park. Clean, neat, nicely kept. Makes for a relaxing walk. The fact that no bikes are allowed on the walking paths are nice. ||June 7, 2016
CarlB83||50||True leisure in the heart of the city. From longwater to the Diana memorial. Hyde Park offers something every day.||June 6, 2016
kirstymcl116||50||This park was right across the road from where I was staying, it's extremely central, very large, you will have a nice pleasant walk around it. One thing that I enjoyed and that surprised me is that the squirrels are not afraid of people..... They come right up to you looking for food!! I wouldn't recommend giving them any though unless you have nuts on hand or other items from their regular diet, never know what a McDonald's beef burger might do to their digestive systems!!! ||June 6, 2016
BarmyauntTenerife||50||We were on Santander bikes and parked them up in a stand to walk around the park, picking up another couple of bikes 90 minutes later. There's something special about feeding the waterbirds at Hyde Park, especially if you now live in a country where there aren't many of these particular feathered beasties around. We also found a friendly squirrel at the kiosk by the bridge. Well worth a visit to remember that London isn't all buildings, traffic and top speed whizzing from here to there.||June 6, 2016
854DP||40||Nice place to stroll or have a picnic, jog or walk the dog. This morning we watched the police horses doing jumps in an arena and the guards riding their huge shire horses through this beautiful green tree clad park in the heart of London.||June 6, 2016
iCatYork||50||This is a park that I keep coming back to again and again. It's wonderful for strolling round in, and there are opportunities for refreshments here and there. ||June 6, 2016
StevenWalk123||50||Excellent place on a hot sunny day to relax with a book or a speaker and friends. They have a hire boat area to take on the lake which is alot of fun.||June 6, 2016
Dimicke M||50||To start with, I am a lite bit biased when it comes to Hyde Park as it is at the end of the road I live on, so it is my local run and picnic spot. It is however absolutely beautiful with loads of things for individuals, couples and families to do. An absolute must when in London!||June 6, 2016
Cazza02||50||We walked from Wellington's house through the gardens in the late afternoon sunshine. It seemed all of London had come out to walk, jog or bike ride on this beautiful park which is so lush and green. An Oasis from the traffic. We reached the Arch at the other side to find children enjoying the large coloured bubble being blown into the park. Great atmosphere||June 6, 2016
michellest19||50||I love Hyde park. Only visited it once and fell in love with it. They have plenty to do there. They have a boating lake, we went on the pedalows but they also have rowing boats too. But pricey think we paid £12 each but it was for an hour. They have deck chairs to sit on, plenty of lovely gardens to walk threw & its right next to the underground. ||June 6, 2016
846robb||40||We walked through the park extensively and enjoyed many of the features there. The Princess Fountain was in the middle of the park, but we got lost trying to find it. Nevertheless, we saw a great deal of wildlife, beautiful surroundings and people just enjoying life. A great place for a relaxing walk.||June 6, 2016
Elizabeth S||50||This is our 3rd visit to London in a year, and I so look forward to being in Hude Park! Glorious fresh healthy trees, glades, gardens, amazing waterways, and many versions of formal gardens. I especially love the Italian gardens but there are so many!Plan two different days of walking and you will feel so refreshed. A great cure for jet lag!||June 5, 2016
Guestbdor||40||If u visits London , u must go there to enjoy the huge park. And if u have kids they will enjoy feeding the ducks and riding the pedal boat. ||June 5, 2016
Johns1776||50||We went into Hyde Park at a number of different gates. We enjoyed the gardens, Diana's fountain, the Albert Memorial, Kensington Palace, the Embassies, Serpentine lake and just aquiet place to relax from the fast paced city.||June 5, 2016
Joan P||50||Can't really believe this is in London. Its a huge park, with plenty to see. I loved the skaters and runners everywhere. Only very minor gripe is that there are almost no toilets, so pay a visit if you happen to see one||June 5, 2016
Podchhdy||30||then i found it , the diana fountian.spring was in full swing , queen's guards on horseback , (a bit disney), but fun. good for walking and jogging, like any park i suppose, nice in a light drizzle to amble about||June 4, 2016
hs155||50||Walked through this park several times over the years and always seem to see different things,it really is a lovely way to spend some time,and amazing area to find in the centre of London.Where else would you find lakeside cafés,gardens,children's play area,deck-chairs and squirrels that would eat out of your hand!||June 4, 2016
Ade1905||40||Never been? Shame make it a priority, great on a summers evening then get the last train home. Take a picnic though they know how to charge.||June 4, 2016
Gillgamishm||50||It is something different than a park you can't recognize where it is behind and where it is finish , full park with green areas and a plenty of activity to spend a nice and relaxing day||June 4, 2016
Graham R||50||Nice stroll through Hyde Park. Then off to Speakers Corner to listen to the debates of the 21st Century||June 4, 2016
AvidTraveler12||40||Hyde park Corner is slightly detached from the park itself and surrounded by a major roundabout & directly assessable via the London Underground. Don't let this put you off it is well worth a visit.We watched the horse guards parade under the arch, as well as the giant arch there are tributes & memorials to the Anzacs which are well worth seeing.||June 4, 2016
Margaret M||40||you can hire horses to ride in the park. every one walks and rides bikes in the bike , be different hire a horse.the princess Diana water memorial is in this park - very low key||June 3, 2016
angnott||50||We stayed across from Hyde park corner so Hyde park was our home base. We walked around ~3/4 of it looking at the formal gardens, the serpentine lake, monuments, memorials, and Kensington palace. It is beautiful. We walked over and had breakfast three days and lunch once during our stay at the serpentine restaurant by the lake. Beautiful views, great peppermint tea, nice pastries!||June 3, 2016
Revelandinspire||40||Living up to its name - yes! Huge park and amazing when the sun is out and people flood the grass fields.. Truly summer feel with ice cream shops around, sun chairs and picnics. Do head here with family, friends and love ones when the sun is out! It's great fun! ||June 3, 2016
ROLI A||50||This is a must visit when in London. A relaxing and refreshing place. Lido restaurant besides Serpentine has some delicious food.||June 3, 2016
TwoDividedByZero||40||You step into this huge area from London's busy streets and it instantly feels like an oasis of calm. There are several different parts, ranging from beautiful flower gardens with sculptures and cascades, to open grassed areas, and of course, the huge Serpentine lake.There are plenty of benches everywhere and it doesn't feel crowded. There are several food outlets dotted around, offering a range of food, from snacks to full meals, which you can eat overlooking the water on terraces.There are lots of pedal boats available to hire. Also a big attraction are the copious swans, ducks, Egyptian Geese, herons and many more species. We were lucky today to see many fluffy chicks too! Squirrels here are spectacularly tame and fearless and you will be able to get up close to them!On one side of the Serpentine is the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, which you may easily miss if you are looking for a traditional memorial. It's a sort of circular pathway of stone with a gentle cascade of water. It has a separate review page on here.Finally, but essentially, toilets are available next to some of the cafe areas!||June 3, 2016
Kellyloo64||50||Hired bikes to go around Hyde Park, certainly worth it. Cost £2 to hire a bike and the first half hour is free. It takes that long to go around and stop a couple of times. Keep an eye on your time if you don't want to pay another £2 for going over the free half hour. Great cheap activity, the teenagers even enjoyed.||June 3, 2016
Hannax74||50||beautiful walk through the park. Visit italian gardens on the north side, Princes Di's memorial and see a variety of birds and bunnies!||June 3, 2016
Michele L||50||A highlight of our trip to London. This is a well maintained and beautiful park. We rented bicycles to ride along the designated paths and found this to be a VERY memorable part of the trip.||June 3, 2016

whereveganseat||50||Clean, beautiful, relaxing and just generally a wonderful attraction. I've spent many a day at Hyde Park throughout my childhood and adult life. Lovely place to have a picnic or ride a bike.||June 3, 2016
627432||50||It is well worth checking the web to see what events are happening in London during your visit to the City.To mark the Queens Coronation, we saw the 41 gun salute at Hyde Park (Marble Arch). The experience was great.A royal band march through the park, playing a variety of tunes and that alone is great to see.In the distance, across the park hundreds of military on horseback come into view, bringing with them the cannons. They speedily dismount, set up the cannons, and those that are not part of the firing squad (probably not the correct terminology), depart, taking the spare horses with them. With style and precision, that only the military have, the salute takes places and the cannons are fired. Its loud! A great event to watch - no matter what the weather - in one of Londons fabulous parks.||June 3, 2016
travelight06||50||I love Hyde Park - I cycle through it most days and find it so relaxing and invigorating. There are big open areas to just enjoy the park or manicured gardens and fountains - something for everyone.||June 2, 2016
vickileb||50||The park was quiet large but it was well kept and quite beautiful! would have loved to have had a picnic there in the day time ||June 2, 2016

Claudia P||50||It is the perfect spot to relax after a long day in the city!! We stayed in the Paddington area and we use to walk through it to get to different places. It is beautiful!||June 1, 2016
Jerry H||40||A huge park with trees, flowers, play areas, a lovely lake, and miles of footpaths. Use a sunny day to walk, play, watch the boats on the lake, or tempt a squirrel with a bit of food.Forget about the noise and bustle of the city for a while.||June 1, 2016
Bryno||50||How lucky is anyone living in London that has easy access to this stunning amenity? When we were in London for four days recently I walked there every day and enjoyed every one of them, never felt threatened and in fact felt very calm and happy using the park. There are miles of paths for walkers and runners. Thankfully bicycles are banned from the park though I do believe that there are some designated bike paths there but I didn't see many of them when I was there. The park is beautifully maintained, and the water features (Italian Garden, The Diana memorial and of course the Serpentine) are exceptional. There are hundreds of acres of grass to sit on, run on, play on and enjoy. We picnicked there twice. The best picnic location in all of London. When you visit the park, there are large maps displayed at each of the gates and to be honest navigating your way around is pretty easy. However I do recommend that you have a map of your own of the park (most hotels will have one) so at least if you do feel a little lost or you need to gauge a walking distance you can do so.To give you an idea, a leisurely walk from Marlborough Gate on the south side of the park to the Albert Memorial on the north perimeter side only takes about 15 minutes.If you don't visit Hyde Park when you visit London,then you really haven't visited London. DO IT.||June 1, 2016
jayou2016||40||We were visiting London for my son's birthday which he happens to share with the Queen. We were able to walk through Hyde Park on our way to the Science Museum and witness the 21 Gun salute in honour of the Queen's 90 th birthday. It was a beautiful day so we then stopped at the cafe and enjoyed an artisan ice cream in the sunshine by the lake.We then headed down to the Diana Memorial Park- what a beautiful water feature and a place to sit and enjoy some tranquility in central London. ||June 1, 2016
Nicoleshanelle||30||Visited Hyde Park for the bank holiday, nice place to just sit and chill out with friends with a nice picnic. On entrance we saw some chairs which was better than sitting on the grass. Before you know it a man approaches us and asks for £1.60, we could of challenged him and said well where is the sign that said we had to pay but we paid it, to then see on the receipt that he only had a hour to sit on the chairs??? I will bring a blanket and pillows next time. Rip off!||June 1, 2016

YuliaS1007||50||Good place to relax, for a picnic or maybe bicycle ride. We kind of rushed trough it, so I recommend making time to come here, explore and maybe relax.||June 1, 2016
CarmLJ||50||Hyde park is lovely in the sunshine, I could laze away a whole day on the beautiful green grass - as long as noone is chanting you off it! The nice but expensive cafe in the centre is a lovely place to watch the ducks, and people watching is great fun on a weekend, we saw quite a few weird and wacky modes of transport getting around the place as it seems Londoners get out and about to test inventions! ||May 31, 2016
WHTraveler||50||The day we visited there was a hippie drum circle which was great fun to watch. The Princess Diana memorial fountain is unusual and lovely. ||May 31, 2016
eygeniar||40||So big park, with many flowers, green grass, lakes and little animals like chip monkeys, little birds and ducks! You can see also the statue of famous people all around! You can take a ride with your bike or just reed in the grass! Reminds me of the Central Park!||May 31, 2016

dsherley||50||This is a large park, with lots to see. However, beware, you'll do a lot of walking . There is a fair amount of green space between the various monuments, gardens, etc. There are bikes and paddle boats available. ||May 31, 2016
crintigger||50||We wandered across the park from Marble Arch through the gardens at SE side and really enjoyed it after all the crowded streets of London. Skip the TUBE and walk!||May 31, 2016
Ignacio T||50||After spending some time in crowded streets in "the city" area and near Buckingham Palace crowds, this was a refreshing break. The park is very well maintained and it's a great place to take a stroll, relax, take in the fresh air and enjoy the wildlife. I'd recommend walking through it from north to south and continue enjoying a quiet stroll around South Kensington.||May 31, 2016

Shom926||40||There's so much to see and do that you'll have to come again and again. Every time we come, we try to go to a different part of the park to find new things to see and do. This time we went on the puddle boats in the afternoon which was nice as it wasn't too hot. Wasn't the first time but had forgotten the prices so checked online. They need to update the website because the pricing were not current. ||May 29, 2016
FoenixP||50||It's such a rewarding moment to see sunset when walking along the river inside the park in dusk(which is close to 20:00 O'clock).All the white swans and birds either rest along the bank or quietly stay in the middle of the river. Squirrels running around grassland. Human beings enjoy their companies. Such a great harmonious place. ||May 29, 2016

George M||50||What an asset to the city of London to have this great, green space that everyone can enjoy whether you are cycling, running or out for a family stroll. So many different routes you can find something new to see each time. Great to see a park so well-maintained and being enjoyed by so many people.||May 29, 2016
Ann M||30||We arrived at the SE corner of the park and looked around a bit. Huge park with lots of things to see and do. Since it looked unkempt at the SE location, we decided to walk on to Buckingham palace. It is a great place to just chill-out.||May 29, 2016
varoadking||50||We walked from the Marriott County Hall at Westminster Bridge to Kensington Palace...about 3 miles, 2 of them within Hyde Park. The Park is beautifullly maintained. The Serpentine Lake is much larger than one might think. Mid-way thru the Park you will come across the Lady Di fountain, which is enjoyed by children playing in the water. The Park hosts a wide variety of birds, and dogs of every shape and size are free to roam and meet with passers-by. It's a relaxing stroll in a great green space, surrounded by a busy, iconic City. Well worth the visit...||May 29, 2016
TheRealMissFrost||50||Went in November me and my friend for the weekend and had booked winter wonderland had an absolutely fab time so much to do, we spent an hour ice skating they offered photographers to catch the moment which was fun, we also booked the ice bar, which was definitely worth it the cocktails were delish couldn't spend too long in there though it seriously is cold!!.. ||May 29, 2016

kellyw0man||50||After traveling through Spain, it was lovely to just wander through Hyde Park . We found you could easily go from one section of London to another and avoid waking through crowed on the streets. Amazing Sunday morning grabbed a coffee and some pastries , found ourselves a beautiful spot in the shade and relaxed.||May 28, 2016
Ogi0||50||The park is huge and it is relatively quiet. Interestingly is 'The serpentine' and rose garden.Beware of arrogant cyclists on the outskirts of the park, which do not respect pedestrians.||May 28, 2016
Photography by ... P||20||Visited here today with my 4 month old puppy for a nice walk and to also hopefully take some photos but was a complete waste of time really! Travelled all the way from east London and the park is nothing but open green space and waste land. Lots of people sunbathing or having picnics and have to walk miles to get to the lake or to anywhere that isn't just grass! I'm just glad I visited before bringing my photography group here as would've been a complete nightmare - not suitable for anyone with a disability or elderly as there is far too much walking involved. I hear they have lots of events here so at least all that waste land is suitable for something I suppose! I have visited here before around Christmas when winter wonderland was open and that was crap too. The name "Winter wonderland" makes you think fake snow, Christmas lights, Christmas market, mulled wine and beautiful atmosphere... Couldn't be further from what it is, it's basically just a glorified funfair and would never go again! ||May 28, 2016
dlark||50||Go and enjoy the real London. Rub shoulders with the locals, particularly on a nice day. Put your walking shoes on or get a hire bike. But don't get caught out the toilets are hard to find!||May 28, 2016

We love this Park and come here every time we are in London!||May 27, 2016

Scarisbrick||50||Large park crisscrossed with footpaths, bike paths and horse-friendly paths. Excellent plantings, great statuary - and a grand way to get from A-B and relax in the process. You can even swim at the Lido if you can brave the likely-to-be chilly Serpentine waters. ||May 27, 2016
cddigg0112016||40||Since it doesn't have as many trees as Kensington, it is not quiet as pretty or quiet. It is still a lovely park with lots of trails.||May 27, 2016
Drewhelle||50||Such a wonderful place to explore away from the noise of the city. Wonderful walks, gardens, lakes and wonderful wildlife. Highly recommend hiring a bike (Santander Cycles which can be found at various locations in the park/s - check the park maps or internet) and cycle the paths around Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens and finish off with a picnic and a good book under a tree. For us, a must do when in London.||May 27, 2016

Caosburn1995||50||The park is very large, but is very diverse. Lots of paths for walking, biking and even skateboarding. Lakes, flowers and many trees. You don't feel like you are in the heart of London. Beautiful way to get to Kensington Palace. ||May 26, 2016
bribar72||50||A beautiful day for a walk through Hyde Park and around the Serpentine. At times it is hard to remember that you are in London. It would be easy to spend hours walking round enjoying the park, drinking coffee and eating cake at one of the numerous cafes. ||May 26, 2016
Gabriele1989||40||My girlfriend and I, having decided to visit Buckingham Palace, decided to stop for a quick walk and a waffle at hyde park. The place is massive, very peaceful but at the same time packed with people; there are several food stalls (had an ice-cream with waffle) so that even if you grow tired of walking you can easily regain your energies to wander around. I especially loved the pond from which i took some pictures i really love. Would not call it a must-do, but if you have time enough just relax and leave the bustle of the city, without actually leaving it.||May 26, 2016
Ges R||50||Hyde park offers a variety of experiences, from feeling like on is in the depths of the country while in the heart of London, through to boating on the famous serpentine lake or watching the household cavalry practising moves on Rotten Row. it contains an art gallery as well as places to eat or just sit and watch the world go by||May 26, 2016
Alberto D||50||Always a destination to have a great walk in nature and relax at any time of the year. There are always people in the mix, people jogging, people "horseing", people eating and people laughing. A must for all travellers to London.||May 26, 2016

not_fletch||50||Park stretches from marble arch to Buckingham Palace and all the way to Kensington Palace. You could spend a whole afternoon walking the park and not see everything. It's nice to just sit back and watch the world pass by...everyone is so busy with their daily lives they don't look out and enjoy what's just outside there homes or hotel rooms. ||May 25, 2016
Hoteltrips90||40||Quiet park (I assume because it was winter) which is wonderful if you want to enjoy the outdoor scenery. ||May 25, 2016

Kerry B||50||Early morning walks and even in the cooler days seeing people swim this is and always will be a place not yo be missed. We saw horses being exercised, people just enjoying the Indisn summer days. ||May 25, 2016
MarkNob||40||Hyde Park is an oasis in the middle of a large urban sprawl. It really is massive. It has paths meandering throughout with lakes and leafy vegetation. If you want some peaceful refuge from the maddening hordes then take a walk around this park. ||May 25, 2016
Jonathan575||50||Again, as with St. James, part of the "lungs" of Central London.A magnificent, large space, which contains the famous Serpentine, with its flocks of birds and geese. London's parks are meant to be enjoyed. Don't miss them. ||May 25, 2016
148fredg||50||Hyde park is bigger than you think. Fun running biking walking-- take the kids dogs have a picnic place. Activities paddle boats. Even better Kensington Palace. The Princess Diane Memorial. A couple places to eat-- get snacks. Coffee. Across from some embassies. Beautiful birds. Lovely gardens. ||May 25, 2016
charlesblm||50||How can you beat a spring stroll in this fabulous city park, almost like a walk in the countryside. Well worth the stroll, lots of tourists there but not too crowded, the trees are so beautiful in the spring when we went.||May 25, 2016
Kennypo20||50||Whilst on a 3 day visit to London we went to Hyde park and Kensington gardens for a stroll.Not having been to this facility before we were amazed at the beautiful layout of the gardens which has within it a beautiful Italian garden layout.The lake is beautiful and has many different varieties of ducks etc.Also the princess Diana memorial is there and a lovely spot to rest and contemplate.Great for families and there are various cafes around the gardens for a coffee or tea and a light refreshments.On a sunny day you could not want for a more peaceful and relaxing place to visit.Also very easy to get to by bus.The park is very clean and the trees and flower beds are manicured.||May 25, 2016
87wendywoo||50||We walked from frantic,noisy Hyde Park Corner into a peaceful haven - what a lovely surprise it was too. A lovely little scented garden (boy and a dolphin) where you just sit and look at the beautiful flowers and some of the biggest rambling roses I have ever seen. We had a drink over looking the Serpentine with its range of water birds. We strolled on beside the lake with its pretty views and seats perfect for just enjoying. Lots of people hired bikes to ride around the park - it is pretty big and a good way to enjoy a sunny day.We also saw horses from the local riding stables being ridden along special tracks. Such a lovely way to spend a couple of hours and rest your aching feet||May 25, 2016
Sara S||50||One of our favorite parks in London. We visited the park a couple times. It's a great place to walk around and take photos as well as just relax for an afternoon with a good book.||May 25, 2016
Jan L||50||We enjoyed a stroll through Hyde Park on a beautiful Sunday in May. It is especially nice to walk along the Long Water and see the beautiful white swans. Add on the Italian Gardens and Kensington Palace. A nice way to spend the day!||May 25, 2016
Diet_critic||50||Highly recommend to relax in a sunny day in the weekend and to enjoy your spare time with friends. You can also hire a boat for £10 per person for half an hour in the Serpentine Lake.||May 25, 2016
bennis91||40||Was amazed by how clean this park was. Hire a bike for a couple of pounds and let the wind blow through your hair as you ride through this majestic piece of land. Situated between Kensington Palace and Buckingham palace its the perfect destination for a day trip.||May 24, 2016
maryjos727||50||For a change of pace and to let the children run around, one afternoon, we walked over to Hyde Park, from our daughter's hotel in Mayfair. Lots of people on a beautiful sunny day! Some were on benches, or on the grass, others rented lawn chairs and were sunning themselves. Many families with strollers and baby carriages passed by. There were ducks of all sorts and plenty of action as they flew and landed. A couple of shops were sprinkled in, supplying sundries and souvenirs. We found the Boathouse and planned to rent a Paddleboat (but we didn't). The restaurant we passed has a large deck and it was crowded with young people enjoying the lake view along with lunch. We saw Speakers' Corner, but no soapbox for me to climb to vent my political spleen, but there were picnic tables and a food stand. The one thing that made me nervous was the activity. The bikers and skaters and runners came up on us suddenly, and with children I was unnerved. Had I been familiar with the road markings and the rules, I would have been more relaxed, I'm sure. But as a Grandmom, I was afraid of an accident, due to my slow reaction time, or swaying walk. Eventually, we moved to the grass and that solved it.It was a very beautiful scene and an oasis in the City.Great planning, a City of London!!||May 24, 2016
mamakath61||50||We walked through the park several time as it was close to our hotel and it is a well laid out park. Kensington Palace sits in the park and has beautiful gardens. It's worth a visit.||May 24, 2016
ssannamariaaa||40||This was a very peaceful park where sitting on a bench watching birds and fountains makes your day - especially if you've been walking a lot. Not a special park really, compared to some other ones, but a very nice place to calm down and have a little picnic. ||May 24, 2016
marina g||40||Hyde Park is a true oasis. My daughter and I walked the entire park and loved watching the dogs run around and the domesticated birds feeding from people's hands. We rented bikes for 2 pounds per day which gave our feet reprieve. However, we were yelled at by two Londoners because we rode our bikes on walking paths without knowing it. There is a hefty fine if the park keepers catch you. You would think that with all of the paths available, bikes would be welcomed over then entire park, but that is not the case. We had to take the bikes onto the really busy streets, or we had to walk the bikes half way around the park which was disappointing. The park is a must, however, because there are gorgeous monuments and Kensington Palace is there, too. We went to the park so many times because of the beauty.||May 24, 2016
RemonSamuel||40||This park is one of the largest parks in London. it is in Central London. It is a very nice place to walk through specially if the weather is fine.||May 24, 2016
545medva||40||This is the green lunge of London. Most probably you cannot discover the whole park it is so big. You can have a nice picnic on the grass. Hyde Park Corner is still a place, where you watch different speeches.||May 24, 2016
Nativeblue S||40||what a park and what beautiful tress all around, greenery..., one can play and cycle all over, loveley people of all nation sit in the grass and do their business||May 24, 2016
Karla C||40||Hide park..dominates the most beautiful area of London. It is a must see.. the nature, the freshness and feeling of being in the countryside inspite of being in the centre of one of the busiest cities in the world. Unforgettable open concerts.. too! Just a beauty!! Love it!!||May 23, 2016
Bordersbloke||40||We enjoyed a nice afternoon in the park where we went on the boating lake and played that great London passtime of "try to hear a local accent".||May 23, 2016
vcross1234||50||Highly recommend visiting EVERY London park. Each is different and more beautiful than the next. London knows how to do parks. It's a great break from the hustle of the city||May 23, 2016
GloballeaderLisa||50||Sooooo much to see and do here! Whether it is walking through the 4000 trees or paddle boating on the lake, visiting the Diana memorial feature or such, you won't want to miss this!||May 23, 2016
lukec44||50||Nice place to go for a walk in the sunshine and grab an ice cream. Will be going back next time I visit London.||May 23, 2016
grandmachris8870||50||It was good to relax with refreshments from the kiosk by the Serpentine where the Princess Diana Memorial fountain can be seen on a hectic weekend in London.||May 23, 2016
890RichardF||30||Whilst it would have been nice to walk through the Park itself - from the Royal Albert Hall back to Lancaster Gate - I can understand why it's shut at night; however, along Carriage Drive, it is extremely dark while work is being done on the street lighting. It's more like walking along a country lane at the moment (and equally uneven).It would have been nice if the park could have been opened during these works to get away from the dark road.||May 23, 2016
MBrandsson||50||I love nature... Any city I travel to, be it because of work or with my partner I take my time to visit the local parks or garden ... The Hyde park is my standard "must go" London places. A One hour walk makes you feel reborn. Fantastic||May 23, 2016
Nomadman411978||50||London has some of the largest parks of any capital city. Despite being in the middle of London you can forget you're there and if you're a first time visitor you might get lost. Plenty to see and a walk around the perimeter will take several hours. Marvellous displays of flowers with abundant birds and wildlife.||May 23, 2016
Tina N||30||Just a park for you to walk through...I thought there would be much for you to do, especially since I had a fascination with this park since I was kid reading from my cousin's ESL textbook. I guess if you needed a break from the urban atmosphere of Central London, here's the place to go. ||May 22, 2016
kimr256||50||We were lucky enough to enjoy spring flowers in London. they are not to be missed. Enjoyed all the walking paths. a quiet space in busy London||May 22, 2016
int-k||40||a lovely big park with pockets of seclusion in the centre of a stunning city! A few things to do but best to just walk around without a plan and explore. ||May 22, 2016
Patricia D||50||Beautiful open spaces, clean, tranquil, lots of variety, a very pleasant oasis of peace in a bustling city||May 22, 2016
BR4DY_nz||50||We arrived thinking we'd be here half an hour, we ended up spending all afternoon here. So much to see, so many nice walks. The diana playground north west corner is a must-do if you've got little ones. Was hard pulling her away to walk south to Kensington Gardens & then onto Harrods.||May 22, 2016
Freakanika||50||Walk to the Albert memorial and then find the 'squirrel trail' where squirrels will be super friendly to you.||May 22, 2016

Aya K||50||this is one of the biggest and famous parks in the world. with fairy Christmas market in winter, and colorful views in summer must-visit place in the heart of London ||May 21, 2016
Sadieodie||50||Hyde Park feels like a step back in time. The park has beautiful flowers and shrubs. There is a large lake with at least 100 beautiful white swans floating on it. It's like being in a fairy tale. People were leisurely walking around, picnicking, and relaxing. Our Hilton Hotel was close to one entrance of the park. At the other end was Kensington Palace. Hyde Park is definitely worth walking through. The Rollong Stones even thought so. ||May 21, 2016
memsogan||40||If you have the chance to be in London in a sunny weekend, hyde park will be full. However head there in the morning for a jog or stroll and your experience will be awesome.||May 21, 2016
Sand_staffordshire||50||Lovely to walk in the park or to watch all the activities that go on there.

Lovely to sit in the park and just enjoy...||May 21, 2016
Alessandra C||50||We loved to walk in the park even if it was rainy. We entered from Kensigton and walked till Marble Arch where you can find the Speaker's corner. There are lakes and birds spots (we met nice green parrots!), not to mention the crazy squirrels we met along the path.Great place, maybe you need two days or more to enjoy it all. ||May 21, 2016

Gordon B||50||I love to spend time unwinding in Hyde Park. A great place to run, stroll, ride a bike, or juts sit in the sun or feed the ducks at one of the ponds. escape from the bustle of the city, get recharged spiritually.||May 20, 2016

Johntour||50||The biggest park in Central London, Hyde Park is the best place to hang out for picnics and ball games.Situated near Oxford Street, Park Lane and Knightsbridge, Park Lane provides all-round happiness and is the perfect place to reflect and get away from life. Some people think you need to get out of London for a quiet spot, but Hyde Park will more than provide tranquil happiness if you walk far enough in, particularly around the Serpentine lake where boats and a restaurant can be seen and where you can have food whilst watching the local wildlife.During the Summer, around July, the park is used for a series of concerts, called HYDE PARK CALLING. 2016's schedule includes Carole King performing her classic album TAPESTRY in her first concert since the 1980s and Stevie Wonder performing his classic album SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE. The week before these concerts, the arena created for them opens up free, where there are free outdoor screenings of classic films like GHOSTBUSTERS, TOP GUN and DIRTY DANCING, watched with headphones. Early arrival is recommended to bag a good spot, whilst watching the film with lager in plastic cups.Previous years have seen the likes of The Rolling Stones perform a free concert in 1969, Blur making a comeback concert, Cliff Richard performing as part of the Route of Kings concerts in 1999 and Shania Twain. Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney had their set cut short performing TWIST AND SHOUT due to noise restrictions after complaints from local residents. It was also the venue for LIVE 8 in 2005, where Madonna performed RAY OF LIGHT and the little girl who was starving in the LIVE AID companion video to the song DRIVE by The Cars, made a triumphant appearance to inspire generations that it is possible to rise above any bad situation.At Christmas, between November and January, part of the park is closed to make way for Winter Wonderland, a purpose built Christmas-themed village where fairground rides and European food and drink delicacies can be tasted whilst a soundtrack of classic Christmas UK hits booms out over the loudspeakers around the area. The centrepoint of the event is the Bavarian Village Hall, where European cover bands serenade and stimulate the audience with classic hits to a diet of German Sausage and Beer.When there isn't anything on, simply find a spot in good weather and enjoy.||May 20, 2016

thscang||50||Great place for a walk anytime of the day. Beautiful landscape. A photographer's choice for portraits. Highly recommend for exercise buffs too. ||May 19, 2016
Gerald P||50||Well worth a visit as it has some hidden gems if you are up for a walk of perhaps 4 miles; the Henry Moore sculpture by the lake, the Italian gardens, the Lido, rose gardens, round pond, Peter Pan statue, children's playground, round pond and just the space and trees. ||May 18, 2016
Dewi R||50||I used to go jogging there once in a while. The best time to go jogging is of course summer, but you can have more layer of clothes during fall and spring. It was super huge park. There are some small sections of particular flowers. The lake along with the swans and the ducks is just too pretty to be left out. Besides, if you are lucky, you can bump into some royal guards and the horses marching in the park!||May 18, 2016
Bill X||50||You should visit it when it is sunny! Take some nuts with you and try to feed the squirrels. They are really friendly!||May 18, 2016

KanwarTavy||40||Fantastic for an early morning run or walk- good for a sunny day outing- great lawns, ample spaces, great for reading a book and passing an afternoon||May 18, 2016
Rex-N-Rolls||40||This is the park that all city parks are trying to recreate. Looking at the park from a map will not do it justice. You need to go here and forget the city. Not sure how they manage to have a slice of the country right in the middle in the city.||May 18, 2016
kiwibaby||50||I managed to luck with one of the best days so far in spring. And it was Friday so very few people. The flowers are wonderful. 350 acres of green in the city. A must visit. Diana fountain also a must ||May 18, 2016

s f||50||take a walking circuit of the Serpentine for great views. or hire a boat ! Walk through to Knightsbridge avoiding the traffic.||May 18, 2016
TheCoconutC||50||The park is huge and has numerous different parts which are worth a visit eg, Kensington Palace, The serpentine, Princess Diana memorial, The Italian Gardens etc. My recommendation is to start at Kensington Palace, walk through Bayswater to the Italian Gardens and get Barclay Bikes from there to the memorial and The serpentine. Choose a sunny day so you can rent a boat and paddle around on the serpentine. Then get afternoon tea at the Lido restaurant.||May 18, 2016
Tupac96||50||Hyde park is massive and even when it's busy there are plenty of areas that you can relax and watch the world go by without being too overcrowded. It's immaculately kept and very clean .

Debra H||50||My husband and I spent several days in London and walking through Hyde Park on our way back and forth to various places was truly one of the best things we did!!!!! This park is magnificent, clean, and peaceful!!! There are maps everywhere clearly marking where you are and directing you to the next spot. Don't miss spending a portion of your time here!!!!||May 17, 2016
Redlizzard||50||There are bicycle rental areas which we did not try since we wanted to walk it. It was very clean and people were enjoying walks and lounging in the grassy areas. We walked through this park twice during our 4 day stay since it was a way to get to the other side to where we wanted to eat.||May 17, 2016
Dongnan||50||it is with Kensington Park attached. you can see the palace right side. by enjoying fresh air , you can see swan in the lake and fresh meadow all over the park.||May 17, 2016

Sarah K||30||Again, most locals don't hangout here. But it's still a beautiful park to see and I highly recommend it.||May 16, 2016
Joseph S||50||This park is the largest in London and has many things to do with its wide open spaces, paddle boats, ponds/small lakes, Italian gardens, horse riding, jogging, many monuments and lots of fun people. A nice contrast to the hustle/ bustle in the city.||May 16, 2016
Nicola D||50||I love taking a walk in Hyde Park and it doesn't matter if the sun is shining or not. Once you get a few steps in the noise of the traffic, and believe me it is noisy around the park, fades away and you can enjoy the wide open grassy or find a tree to sit under in. On sunny days take sunscreen. You will get burned!On cold days I like to wander down to the Serpentine and enjoy a hot chocolate while watching the ducks or reading a book or you could just sit back and enjoy the tranquillity. If you go at the right time of day you might even meet one or more of the horse-guards exercising their horses. ||May 16, 2016
wallstromsimon||50||One of my absolute favorite places in London and a must visit for travelers. The parks offer a lot different activities from ice cream to running. I highly recommend a walk through the park to escape to big city life.||May 16, 2016

PurpliciousPlum||50||One of the go to places for me to relax as it is just a 5-minutes walk from my place of work. Be it sunbathing, relaxing your toes feeling the spring green walking bare feet or just watching everyone else be mesmerized with its beauty - the place has something for all.The Hyde Park is also home to the Winter Wonderland (Christmas Market) which brings life to the park during the cold winter.||May 15, 2016
FDKamal||40||I hear it is better on Sundays, esp for students keen on Free Speech. But as we had kids who like to see birds more than flights of imagination, it was a wonderful walk.||May 15, 2016
Audrey L||50||My husband and I spent an hour riding rented bikes (2 pounds/1/2 hour) our first morning in London and it was by far one of the top highlights of the trip. Tranquil, filled with birds (SWANS!) and happy people. I descrie London as New York's Grandpa and Hyde Park is where he takes his lunch break. Weather was gorgeous; not too hot, not too cold.||May 15, 2016
mk256||50||There are play areas, gardens, a lake, horseback riding, bike and running trails, and a palace all in this very large park that is well used and loved by locals. A recommended spot to get some fresh air and take in the greenery!||May 15, 2016

Abbotsbury92||30||I lived immediately west of Hyde Park / Kensington Palace Gardens in Holland Park for several years in my 20s. I used to walk through the two royal parks regularly. They're expansive but never moved me and generally left me cold. The city encroaches on three sides with no buffer. Not to mention the utterly abysmal Hyde Park Corner, a cacophony of pedestrian-unfriendly concrete and superfluous monuments. I defy you to attempt to navigate across Hyde Park Corner to Green Park (a gem in itself) without developing a general distaste for this intersection.I contrast this with Regent's Park, which is my favourite of the royal parks. There, John Nash's wonderful terraces on three sides and the off-center nature of the gardens at the southeast corner of the park make for subtle vistas broken by trees and natural barriers. A much more human scale. And, abutting Regent's Park, in contrast to the sterility of Mayfair and Knightsbridge, and the grit of Bayswater and Notting Hill Gate surrounding Hyde Park, one enjoys the gentility of St. John's Wood, Primrose Hill and Marylebone.After 20 years away I began travelling to London regularly on business a year ago. I've revisited Hyde Park several times and it still doesn't move me. Instead, if I have time for a large park, it's Regent's and Primrose Hill. And for a small park to call your own, check out Holland Park, which is a lovely gem.I realize that my opinion is heresy to tourists, and perhaps even Londoners, who feel that they must visit Hyde Park and enjoy it. By all means go. It has its charms, particularly late on an autumn or early spring afternoon under a brooding sky. But then go to Regent's and note the substantial difference, variety, and humanness it embodies. I believe you may end up agreeing with me and spending your time accordingly.||May 14, 2016

LydiaCarlisle||50||The Serpentine, Diana's memorial and much more are all in this park. A huge area with plenty of wide paths, grass. Watch out for cyclists and runners. With plenty of small places to have a snack. Close to lots of other attractions and underground/bus services||May 14, 2016
Mehmet A||50||I usually walk through hyde park when the weather is good, unfortunately that is not often, out of the parks in the world, i do believe hyde park is one of the best.||May 14, 2016
delaroma||50||If you, bike, run, walk, enjoy being outdoors this is a great place to visit. Well maintained, beautiful scenery all around but especially by the lakes. Birds galore that frequent and call the lakes home. Several playgrounds for children. Sports fields all over||May 14, 2016
Brian K||50||Just walk, people watch, relax and read, stroll forever and come upon interesting fun sites, walk across the quiet pond to get to shopping galore. It's central and out of the way, simultaneously.||May 14, 2016
kbull777||50||Iv been visiting London quite a lot recently and while it has an abundance of activities and fascinating places to see, its nice to have somewhere you can go to remove yourself from the noise and decompress for a while. Great for a relaxing walk, cycling or even a bit of yoga. Definitely recommend a visit.||May 14, 2016
stigMAnd||30||Visited this park in May 2016 in lovely hot sunny weather. Was plenty of people about, but you could still feel alone and for yourself if you wanted. Well worth a walk through. ||May 13, 2016
jwonker||40||We have been there a few times but the best time to enjoy is on the summer day. There is a very nice Archillies statue which we really like and would recommend everyone to visit. It is hube but also the area neat pond is very nice||May 13, 2016
LynseyLoo09||50||It was my first time here in December 2015. It's a lovely park, seemed very clean and well maintained.||May 13, 2016

A9051OAstephenw||50||It is simply lovely to stroll around the parkI am staying in Bayswater and have a gorgeous view of the park. The sun has been out all week and I have spent many joyful hours relaxing in the park. We leaves in south Ken for 5 years and I forget how much I love this amazing park||May 13, 2016
Andres1||50||After many visits to London over the years, recently walked through Hyde Park for the first time on a Sunny and warm Sunday morning. This is a beautiful and very popular park which is a nice break from the hustle and bustle of central London. With a nice cafe/restaurant at the lakeside, Hyde Park is a great place to chill. Don't forget this is a free attraction, which would be ideal for tourists on a budget. We will certainly return again, and would recommend to others!||May 13, 2016
RedPebble||50||Beautiful sunny days, surprised everyone...lots of walking, close to Buckingham Palace, take the Around London Bus tour,||May 12, 2016
lisatH3164GF||50||Was here a couple years with my boy friend. Lovely place and relaxing. The gardens were nice and the squrls was fun to watch playing around. The birds can eat right off your hand. Defently will go back. ||May 12, 2016
Shoshravid||50||Gorgeous park, Beautiful flowers and trees and of course the ducks, gees, and other wild life. The Diana memorial fountain is so simple and nice, the same way Princess lived her life.||May 12, 2016
debbiekovalsky||40||We really enjoyed visiting Hyde Park and kept finding ourselves on the 'outer edges' of it during our visit. The only reason we gave it 4 stars is because we were limited to where we could ride our bikes. London is progressing to becoming more bike friendly on the streets (the slow traffic is blamed on the bike lanes), but come on, why can't I ride a bike on all the bike paths in a park??? It kept us from getting to the inside locations. At least they could have bike racks so we could lock up and then walk through the park. Just a thought.||May 12, 2016
Dr_Liaqat||50||This is a haven in busy London. Beautiful walks, lovely lake. I don't think I would tire of this park. The Diana memorial fountain is a disappointment but go to the park and the adjoining Kensington Gardens for picnics and you will be satisfied.||May 11, 2016
sharlet2||50||Went for a walk in Hyde Park on Sunday morning. I'm not sure what time it opens, but I was there at 8 a.m. The place is vast and beautiful. Plenty of walking paths, and fun to see the different sights scattered around the park. A good break from the hustle and bustle of the city. I was hoping to find a food kiosk to buy a sweet roll and some coffee, or a snack of some type as I walked around, but no luck. Maybe I was too early, or maybe I was just in the wrong part of the park, though I covered a lot of territory. Hyde Park runs into Kensington Gardens. Do walk over to the Albert Memorial if you get a chance. I was surprised by how grand it is. Not necessarily beautiful, but makes obvious the love Queen Victoria had for her husband.||May 11, 2016
Raecastlehow||50||Impressive park, with a lot of activities going on. In the centre of London but you would not realise . Access to other places to visit are very easy, close to our hotel, which also made it attractive||May 11, 2016
ali657||50||We stayed close by to Hyde park and so enjoyed an early morning walk after breakfast. There is so much going on, i really didn't know where to start ! We enjoyed a walk around the Serpentine, so many beautiful swans and other wildlife to enjoy. The beautiful landscape areas and small river running through is very colourful in the Spring and lots of people feeding the squirrels by hand.There are horses being exercised around the park too which is great to see. So many interesting and beautiful areas, we had 3 walks around the park and still more to see.||May 11, 2016
Wendy P||50||Make the most of this park on a fine day. There is much to see. Basically it is free space in the middle of a hectic, bustling city and it lends itself to all sorts of seasonal events. The restored Italian gardens are exquisite.||May 11, 2016
Lams1||40||London is a noisy place, and going into the parks gives your stay a needed time of time away from the noise. Big park with a lot of space to enjoy.||May 11, 2016
Nidhi D||50||Must visit when you are in London.. Large landscapes with beautiful lakes inside is just too good to miss||May 11, 2016
Jo G||50||This park is large and lovely. Get a tourist bike for £2 per bike for 24 hours. Cycling is safe and there are many trees to rest under if you need to. The park has plenty of services too. Nearby Kensington Gardens is also good for cycling. ||May 10, 2016
MinjeChang||50||It has a beautiful huge lake with some swans in it. It was so adorable. I recommend to check this place out!전 개인적으로 정말 좋았던 곳입니다 호수가 정말 아름답고 백조랑 다른 새들이 많이 있어요 걷다보면 아 이게 영국이구나 싶습니다 추천합니다||May 10, 2016
Bikash S||50||It's a very big park located in Central London .Lots of things to do and good for walking .You will enjoy this place for fresh air .||May 10, 2016
benjamin a||50||A wonderful way to escape the hustle and bustle of central London. However, you are still walking distance to many shopping districts major museums. Lots of time to explore the park through a system of roads and paths that are ideal for biking or just leisurely walking the grass on foot. Beautiful green plants, trees and bushes. Worth a visit! ||May 10, 2016
beau_monde29||50||Hyde Park was actually a forest filled with animals during the times of King Henry. It later turned into a park ,which is now a little above 6000 acres... Really vast.This park is so full of life. People here are full-on in action mode. Either they are playing a sport like football or something else, or there are people jogging away to glory or cycling.You watch them n feel so exhilarated n happy. Families come out here for picnics. Friends are pulling each others' legs and laughing away on a joke unheard . It's like a fairy tale. Closely located to the posh area of Kensington and Knightsbridge, it is located very much central in London. The closest station is the Hyde Park station , of course. Do not miss this wonderful place to get your energy levels back in work mode.||May 10, 2016
abrakadabra2015||40||OK - this is a park. Grass, trees, and (some) flower arrangements. Come here for a walk, as a break from the city stress. Toilet facilites will cost you 20p, but are clean and well kept.||May 10, 2016
Hege J||50||Went pedalboating on the big lake and visited the Diana Park Memoral witch was great. Lovely Castle and big nice park With lots of birds and trees and flowers.||May 10, 2016
Tina S||50||Such a beautiful place to go for a walk, relax and have a coffee. My absolute favorite place in London.||May 10, 2016
zeina328||50||Huge area to rest and have some energetic sports like cycling. Had much of relaxation in the sun with the great smell of grass. If planning to go, take your snack and coffee to enjoy your day out in the sun. ||May 10, 2016
jules55-19||50||Absolutely stunningly beautiful park. The gardens are gorgeous tons of birds, statues, toilets that are clean. I truly enjoyed the park||May 10, 2016
thoughtfulpebble||50||On the one hand, it's just a park. On the other hand, it's really big, and right in the middle of London, great for taking a break from the big city.||May 9, 2016
juleshhh||50||I love Hyde Park, it's a great place to escape the madness of central London & the shopping districts. Only a stone's throw to the major museums and Harrods. You can spend hours exploring the park, there's a system of roads and paths that are ideal on bicycle or you can stroll through the grass on foot. Beautiful greenery and a hint of the English countryside right in the heart of chaotic London (no comparison to actually visiting the countryside). Well worth a visit!||May 9, 2016
hutokship1||50||The land cap of Hyde Park is excellent . The way it's maintained is commendable . The variety of birds, squirrels and the ducks are worth watching. One can spend hours just walking or sitting and breath in all pure air.||May 9, 2016
Tlovetotravel321||40||Nice place to go for running or sunbathing on the grass or just watching the many kinds of birds in the lake.||May 9, 2016
Teawithshan||50||Being from Scotland my poor wee body wasn't ready for the 25 degree weather today so I had to stop for a bit and chill in the shade of the massive trees at Hyde Park.First things first.. its freaking huge! It's full of people doing what they do best. There were people on roller skates doing intricate routines, cyclists slow and fast cutting up the roads, pedal boats for those unlike me who can actually swim! A woman teaching another hula hoop routines. It's a fantastic place to people watch, if thats your kinda thing.||May 9, 2016
PauliinaLunde||50||Perfect for a hot day and you want to take a break. Stroll around or have a pic nic. Not too fixed= feels like nature and not to much of a park. ||May 9, 2016
alicia b||50||With all of London's marvels, I'm always drawn to Hyde Park. There is such a mix of beauty and peace as well as history...Rotten Row and the stellar monuments. The Wellington Arch, the Memorial to Bomber Command, the Memorial to the War Horses, to name only three. Then there's the graceful Serpentine with its swans. If you arrive at Hyde Park Corner about 10AM, you will be in position to see the Queen's Household Cavalry exiting 1 London, Wellington's home, on their daily way to Buckingham Palace.||May 9, 2016
Hungry_Bert||40||A good sized park for all sorts of activities. There were plenty of people walking dogs, running, playing games and exercising.My partner and I spent an afternoon lounging on a blanket in the sunshine drinking cider :)||May 9, 2016
180samk||40||I like Hyde Park a lot... I don't love it. I think it's really a stunning park but if you've been to the rest of the European capitals like Paris, Rome, Madrid, Vienna you may be a bit let down by Hyde Park. It's gorgeous but it's a lot less ornamental. It's a park more in the traditional sense that its an outdoor space in the middle of a big busy city.Its a great place for running!||May 9, 2016
Andranik G||50||Only very reach City can have such a huge parks in the centre. Go to destress in the splendid spring||May 9, 2016
Lucy K||50||Lovely to relax in all afternoon. Can hire bikes nearby. Be aware that the queue for boats is heaving at the weekends when there is nice weather. Also a massive queue for the toilets and an ice cream!||May 9, 2016
JDuong27||40||Definitely a place to visit on a perfect spring weather day. Pros: Lots of areas and routes for you to take and enjoy the scenery. There are picnic grounds and chairs for hire - good for gatherings. You can even hire bikes (no helmet required). We enjoyed our couple's walk after lunch through the green parklands while admiring the live environment filled with tourist and locals. Cons: None really. ||May 8, 2016
goldylonglocks||50||It's so big and peaceful takes a while to walk round it all and has exits to all the high streets around London. I like swans so I was in my element taking photos. There are also some nice sculptures too.There are art events at different times of the year and also music events . Pays to check on line when they are.If you are blessed with sunshine it's a great day out for a picnic.||May 8, 2016
Melody B||50||Huge park inside the city, great walking areas, its easy to walk around and not feel like you are in the middle of a huge metropolitan city. Highly recommend this.||May 8, 2016
SD1189||40||We spent our last afternoon in London in Hyde Park. First we rented chairs and sat in the sunny warm weather for a couple hours reading. Then we walked to the lake and rented a row boat. The park is very clean with lots of walking paths. A very lovely afternoon.||May 8, 2016
profjoypc||40||Hyde Park is well worth strolling in in all seasons but was especially beautiful on our recent visit in late April when the sun was shining and the trees and flowers were at their springtime best. One can truly escape the traffic bustle and noise of the London streets here and enjoy peace and beautiful views over the Serpentine Lake. It is possible to take a boat ride on the lake and there are ample paths for walking and jogging. If you want a rest, deck chairs are available for hire for a small fee. There is a lovely bar and kitchen overlooking the water which serves casual snacks and more elaborate meals. The park is within easy walking distance of many of the main tourist attractions of London and we recommend it should be explored. Well known events and festivals are held here, for example the London Proms.||May 8, 2016
sureshkc||40||Largest park of london.Loads of people during weekends especially if its sunny.Worth visiting if the weather is favorable.Winter world was fun when we visited last winter.Can cycle around and skate.Just close to buckingham palace, another must go place in london.||May 7, 2016
michaeljacques3||40||I went to London's Hyde Park To Watch a outdoor festival... But couldn't help taking a walk around these well kept grounds... You forget that you are in The Capital City Of London...||May 7, 2016
Venture518336||40||I've been to Hyde Park during a particularly beautiful day. The weather was warm and we could really enjoy our walk through the park. I adored the fact that you can rent little boat and explore the lake inside the park. The place is really well equipped and the only dark spot I could think about is the poor condition of the Italian Fountains that looked dirty (especially the water).||May 7, 2016
salben101||50||Hyde park and it's neighbour Kensington Palace gardens are an oasis in the middle of a busy city. Walk, ride or run around the many paths alongside other tourists and locals. I would recommend getting accomodation close to these parks as you can get a daily walk/jog in then not feel so bad visiting London's many amazing restaurants!||May 6, 2016
Joao S||50||A beautiful park and a place to enjoy life. I recommend to walk a lot and try to rent a bike. Its a good place for jogging, too.||May 6, 2016
Monieblue||50||Perfect weather for a brisk walk in the park.. Met friends and had a leisurely catch up and nice wonder about. Rally nice cafe serving teas drunks and food.. Loads of interesting birds everywhere.. Hand fed a few friendly parrots as well ||May 6, 2016
chelsea5455||50||Lovely place to walk through - grass was litter free and spotless. A good place for runners and cycling. Be a lovely place to relax on a warm day||May 6, 2016
MichaelG848||50||We visited Hyde Park in late April and were very lucky to have had great weather. There is a beautiful Italian Garden at one end with lots of fountains etc. Going further into the park from that end , we fed some parakeets who were not at all shy and take food from you hands. We had sesame seeds and the loved them. I had 6 sitting on me at one stage. Further on is the Princess Diana memorial. I am not a royalist but this is a beautiful memorial that is extremely peaceful , a great place for meditation. Further on we got on the pedalo boat. They cost £14 for two of us. Good fun but hard work. There was loads of other wildlife such as squirrels and loads of birds. Overall a great experience for all ages. ||May 6, 2016
LucaMT||50||There are few city parks in the world as beautiful as Hyde Park.I could certainly mention Richmond Park in London and Central Park in NY (just to name 2).But really ,,, this one is a must !||May 6, 2016
Michael T||50||Time spent walking through Hyde Park, particularly early in the morning, is well worth it and a great way to unwind and forget about things. When its quiet you could be anywhere but only a few minutes walk and you can be in Knightsbridge, or Mayfair. Hyde Park is a huge green space, one of the "lungs of London" and home to the Diana Memorial Fountain, Kensington Gardens and Palace, and the Serpentine boating lake.To put it into perspective for U.S tourists, it is about 3/4 the size of Central Park in New York but surprisingly larger than the Principality of Monaco!||May 6, 2016
michelemcgregor||50||Great place to walk and escape the hustle and bustle of the city traffic. Many places to stop and sit. Well maintained.||May 6, 2016
Kevin H||50||Hyde park is one of the world famous park situated in heart of London .I almost visit this park every time I am at London .It's huge , it's nice and it's open .Good to stroll around and enjoy the freshness of park has to offer .||May 5, 2016
fth2013||50||Reale nice park to relax after 'having done' the science museum. Nice but expensive area of London, where people come to play rugby or just to relax. Great to be away from the travic and noice of the city. ||May 5, 2016
George B||50||Get a map for the park before you go because it's easy to got lost. It feels like the Central Park of London. Absolutely gorgeous and expansive. Like, massive. Lots of runners, families walking, and dogs playing. Several ponds are inside and also massive with lots of bird varieties hanging out in them. They have little sun chairs throughout the park where you can simply rest and sit for a bit - what a fabulous gift! That's what these royal parks are all about, being a gift to the people. There are gardens on the east end of the park with some fountains scattered about. We walked from the east end to the west (to Kensington Palace) and it took about an hour. Beautiful every step of the way!||May 5, 2016
Rahul M||50||Visited Hyde Park number of times including during the Winter Wonderland. You can have a good time with family and friends walking in the park, cycling, or having a picninc. ||May 4, 2016
dickmaleny||50||So history fans will know what Tyburn is. I went there to particularly find it and it wasn't that simple. Go to Hyde Park Corner where the Marble Arch is and look down at the pavers. You will find some that mark Tyburn. From there, if you like a walk, wander through and you will find it joins Kensington Gardens so you can visit Kate and Wills. Lovely arvo out.||May 4, 2016
Daniel M||50||I have always wanted to go to London. For many years I watched youtube pages, heard stories about London and read books about it. I am going to give probably a very different review to the reviews over here. One of the images of Hyde Park that I always had in my mind was all the famous and successful people who wrote about it and said how amazing it was. Richard Branson, David Beckham, Jordan Belfort just to name a few. It was a Saturday afternoon and the skies were clear. As i sat down on the bench and tried to let my mind conceive the fact that a dream of mine had come true. I felt extremely overwhelmed and almost in a state of "trance". It was like heaven people of different races, cultures and religions. Different languages and accents were heard and the lush beauty of Hyde Park.It was beyond words and perhaps I had a glimpse of what beauty people see in it and why people who are successful in there on different ways have a big connection to Hyde Park. Its good for the mind and soul. Hyde park is vital when in London||May 4, 2016
Angela3030||50||We have been to Hyde Park several times and visited all the different parts of it, all of which are great, especially the Italian Garden and the Peter Pan statue. On this occasion however, we walked by the southern end of the Serpentine which was lovely in a different way. It is larger and more like a conventional park. We saw a wide range of wildfowl. The cafe is fine, although a bit overpriced which is not surprising as it has no competition. It is useful to stop by for a drink or an ice cream though, or to have a pizza at the restaurant part. It is possible to hire boats too to explore the lake. ||May 3, 2016
eveiechickenylewin||50||This park was just what we needed after a long trip around a museum. Loads of wide open green space and on a nice day very relaxing. Will definitely go again when in London to do more exploring around this park and hopefully take a picnic. Perfect for families with young children.||May 3, 2016
Shelleywelly45||50||Walked through the park on May Day bank holiday Sunday! Beautiful weather and really enjoyed it, you can hire a bike from one end to the other as long as it's under 30 mins it's free. For 24 hrs hire it £2. What an excellent idea.Park is beautiful and well trimmed and neat and the lady Diana memorial waterfall is just heavenly. It was full of paddling children which was so nice to see. ||May 3, 2016
Kristine M||50||Hyde Park is very spacious, but has something for everyone. My husband and daughter rented bikes and rode around the perimeter of the Park. We had a perfect flat right off Kensington High Street, so this park was less then 10 minutes away. There were lovely walking trails and many people had small dogs running (making me wish I had my havanese, Jasper to walk), plus young children were out playing. Kensington Palace also had beautiful gardens with lovely tulips just blooming. I took the Kensington Palace Museum Visit which was one of my favorite. It felt really intimate and so interesting to see the dresses that Princess Diana wore. Seeing Queen Victoria's room and her grand room and bedroom with all her letters and items felt like being at a friend's home. I walked to Hyde Park several different days, just to walk or sit and read or view the gardens. If you are staying in this area, you will appreciate Hyde Park for sure. Loved this Park!!!!!||May 3, 2016
CoreyV21||50||We were walking in here to see the Diana memorial which is a circle with a water pool going around it. It was cold when we were there but I'm sure it's nice when the weather is warmer. There were a lot of cool ducks and birds including the swans which are all property of the queen. A cool place to escape from the city.||May 3, 2016
chienyut2016||40||A must go attraction in London, a good place to jog, play soccer, cycling or just relax with your friends!||May 3, 2016

ShellFos||50||Whether I am travelling solo and need to thrive off my morning run or travelling with baby and need open space Hyde park is my preferred park to find a hotel near by. ||May 3, 2016
lydia912446||40||A lovely large park, with hidden features. I love the italian gardens, Kensington Park Gardens and the serpentine all make for a lovely days walk with the family. ||May 3, 2016
quellomayo||50||I was here on a misty morning after a night in an uncomfortable and noisy hostel and it recharged my batteries for the day ahead. There was someone actually bathing in the water. The birds glided by effortlessly and everything was peaceful enough to make me feel good. I was on my own but I knwo my family would enjoy a walk here so the next time we're in Lurndun we'll go back for sure.||May 2, 2016
Oszk_Zanger153||50||As with all parks I have seen in Europe, the grounds were not only immaculately attended but they were also litter-free. I have only taken one star off for this park because the memorial to Princess Diana is truly small and sad considering that in addition to her well-documented humanitarian efforts, the woman was once Her Royal Highness, Princess of Wales. This British park is overwhelmingly large with Pride and Prejudiceish-type sprawling lawns with primarily swans, fountains and pedal boats to break up the monotony. I have walked through this park twice, once in the rain and one during clear weather. It is beyond serene and the laws in England are such that not only were cars not allowed to drive through the park but even bicyclists were largely precluded from disturbing any pedestrian foot traffic.||May 2, 2016
PhilR265||50||This huge park is great on a warm sunny day and allows you to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. There are benches for sitting and watching the world go by, or you can hire a deckchair. Plenty of ice cream vans around to complete the experience. It's only a short walk to the centre of London so it's easy to get to ||May 2, 2016
VMLTWT||50||Another park where you can relax and have some activity as well. Amazing !!! We keep coming back there. ||May 2, 2016
rayp775||40||Having ventured to Hyde Park Corner to visit Apsley House we then meandered into the park on a beautiful sunny Sunday. Given the weather the park was busy with families, skaters and cyclists but it was still on oasis from the bustle of the City. We walked around the Serpentine where the boats were in big demand and enjoyed a leisurely stroll in the Spring sunshine. Great place to enjoy some downtime and relax.||May 2, 2016
shekhahs||50||Its so huge , so Take a bicycle to see it all and take a short stops to enjoy be carful thou its hard to control the bicycle while there is so many bicycle drivers ||May 1, 2016
Elena M||50||Being the bank holiday weekend there was a big crowd in the park, skating, having pic-nics and generally taking in the sun. The lawn was nicely mowed and the place was extremely clean. We didn't see many squirrels, like other times, they may had been scared off by the number of people around. Be sure to visit the lake side cafe or even hire a boat to stream around in the lake. ||May 1, 2016
WorldIsYourOyster3||50||You can walk around the park for hours with its beautiful scenery and statues. Also home to the Serpentine lake which you can hire a pedelo for and the Princess Diana memorial fountain. Also right next door to Kensington Gardens.A stunning Royal park free for all visitors! FYI there is a cafe but expensive so you are better off bringing in your own food.||May 1, 2016

F9328EMthomasw||40||A fun park in London and if you are coming here on vacation its a must - Enjoy a picnic or a bottle of wine in amazing grass - its so large its not hard to find a spot to watch the world go by!You can also hire a boat although expect to pay £12 each for half an hour!! -||May 1, 2016
SarkLover||50||We had a couple of walks in this lovely park during our recent stay in London. We were there early in the morning both times, before it became too busy.The trees are all starting to come into leaf, and with the added bonus of sunshine, it made our walks very pleasant.We never tire of visiting, whatever time of year.A lovely open space in London||May 1, 2016
SunshineL89||50||Huge park to walk around, and enjoy when the weather is sunny and dry. Lots of families out playing football with little tots, and feeding the birds. All in all lovely||May 1, 2016
400hilaryf||50||You won't be disappointed. It is such a beautiful setting, even in the rain is a magical place. Lots of joggers and bikers though you can't ride your bike in the majority of it. So pack your sneakers and take a stroll. ||April 30, 2016
bogdanp270||40||I have a little tradition to go for a morning jog in every city I visit , and London was no exception, so I chose Hyde park as the destination for this. It's very big, there are a lot of alleyways so if you fancy a nice run it's a good recommendation, as it doesn't tend to feel crowded because of its huge size.||April 30, 2016
Bim_13||50||Beautiful park in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the city. It's the first time I've visited Hyde Park, I had sunshine, I had an ice cream, I had the beautiful serpentine lake to walk next to. Plenty to see and nice to visit as sometimes being in the middle of London feels a bit crazy especially to a tourist, so escaping to some green space for an hour or two to just relax is a lovely experience!||April 30, 2016
AbbeeIAF||50||The place is a great attraction to walk around to enjoy the park as well as the birds and other animals in thew water||April 30, 2016
IsabelH357||50||Lovely park- we fed the birds which was really fun although a little daunting as there was so many of them and they where all pretty hungry. Fun visit for all the family. ||April 30, 2016
kemalsenturkler||50||London's most famous park is most beautiful park of London. After a busy day, you could walk, bike or sit down and relax in this park.||April 30, 2016
Corgipipin||50||I live in London and I go to Hyde park every second weekend and I never get bored, it's a brilliant place to go with children. There is a range of activities from boatin, one of my favourites, the playgrounds, just the grass. There is Diana's memorial fountain which is great fun for children, though do bring a towel. The Peter Pan playground is not as good as it used to be due to the long que and I would not recommend going to it. There's even two art galleries in hydepark so there is something for everybody as well as historic features.||April 29, 2016
Teri M||50||This is a beautiful place to wander through whatever the seasons offer you! The gardens, Serpentine lake, swans, offers something for everyone.||April 29, 2016
franrom81||50||This is something like a London'd lung, I dont know how big is this park, but it's huge, you can find a lot of animals if you go in a good day, a nice walk between nature in the center of London. I love this place with a little bit of Sun!||April 29, 2016
ddalmas||50||Our first day upon landing from the red eye was to stay awake as long as possible. We decided to walk through Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens and both were just lovely. The parks are big but easy to get from one end to another with little stops in cafes throughout the park. Mother Nature ensured we stayed awake treating us to sun, then sprinkles, sun again, large sleet, then sun, then snow! We had it all but still a very lovely day walking through the parks. The Sunken Garden was lovely with tulips, the Diana Memorial fountain was peaceful and unique in its water tumbles. The Serpentine waters were filled with beautiful swans. The rose garden, while not in bloom, was still lovely. Worth a visit especially when trying to stay awake!||April 29, 2016
FoodLover0012||50||It's Hyde Park - just beautiful - what else can I say! Well kept, nice people, lovely area. A woman even stopped to give us directions which was very helpful. ||April 29, 2016
I9497SVelizabethw||50||My hotel was a block away from this park and walked along the paths at several times of day. It is beautiful and worth exploring all the paths and areas. I highly recommend that you take the time to walk here.||April 29, 2016
petersW7573NM||50||Park is huge green area.Many activities are on fields.Sport or walk or relax are available till midnight.Famous speek corner is there,big statue of Albert is near to opposite Royal Albert Hall.Garden is good looking london garden art.||April 29, 2016
613teunh||40||Our hotel was next to the park so we had the liberty to visit it a few times. The park seems endless and if your hotel is near, please walk towards the city via the park -if the weather allows it-. A perfect place for everybody who loves walking or running.||April 28, 2016
Gillian R||40||Beautiful, big park with tons of space and closer to a quieter part of London. Go to people watch, puppy watch, and enjoy a nice long walk.||April 28, 2016
Mann_Kaschewitz125||50||It's such a lovely area and worth taking the time to just wander and relax and enjoy! Along with my wife we decided to visit Hyde Park during our walk from Museums to the Buckingham Palace. Beautiful plants (trees, flowers) and some birds add some positive atmosphere to this place, even though there are many tourists there. One of our favorite things to do when visiting London is to stroll through the park system, and Hyde Park never disappoints.||April 28, 2016
valtina26||40||i had a wonderful walk through this park with a man playing music and people watching them enjoying their day. we stopped and got some ice cream. a perfect touch to a wonderful 75* day||April 28, 2016
Toril N||40||The Hyde Park is a fantastic park. So clean, silent and grenen, - and that in the middle of a big city like London! ||April 28, 2016
Kasia_Kasia1||50||We went there just after New Year. The place was literally transformed into a Christmas village. It was beautiful. The weather was great, place was not crowded. One of my favorite places in London.||April 28, 2016
monkey210||40||Visited the Princess Diana memorial and park. Great views of the Royal Albert hall and memorial. Have a walk around the area if you are a monopoly fan like my kids.||April 28, 2016
spiderpig60||50||I stayed nearby before the London Marathon and looked for places to run before the race. Hyde Park proved to be an excellent choice, a verdant spot of peace and quiet amid the rush of a large city.||April 27, 2016
Jackie C||50||Stunning and so much to see in this park. Some crazy cool statues, Princess Diana memorial, Kensington Palace and the grounds themselves all beautiful could spend the day just exploring here :) ||April 27, 2016
Henggang C||40||It's a nice park and quite big. There is one lake in the park, and you can find many geese, ducks and swans there.||April 27, 2016
Diane B||50||Because we are from Austria we wanted to see "Winter Wonderland" in Hyde Park. The Ice Rink was sponsered by our village "Mayrhofen" <it made us feel very proud or our small community at home. The function of the park reminded us of the Munich Beer festival.||April 27, 2016
dreamer2369||50||A beautiful picturesque park perfect for all ages. Well kept. Stunning views. Amazing monuments and statues. Every part of it had something to look at. Well signposted too. Saw lots of birds and squirrels - fascinating to watch. Such a lovely peaceful area amidst a very busy city. Great for the every day stroller to a marathon runner. Definitely worth a visit.||April 27, 2016
sharpar2015||50||Unbelievable to be in such an iconic park. I walked the length of it twice on either side. It was magical being there, highly recommend the visit! ||April 27, 2016
Hesbells||50||Beautiful stop in central London, even on a chilly day. Lots to walk around and see and enjoy. Pedallo boats are extortionate - a shame because it would have been nice. It was reflected in the number hired though as there was only one out on the lake. The serpentine restaurant is well worth a visit too.||April 27, 2016
Michal K||40||Along with my wife we decided to visit Hyde Park during our walk from Museums to the Buckingham Palace. The park is very green with a stream (river?) cutting it, some cafes, places when one can hire a boat and some benches. During our stay in the park it was windy and trying to rest for a while we walked for about 30 minutes to find any spare bench (there are many benches in the park, but still the number of them is far too small as it should be). Beautiful plants (trees, flowers) and some birds add some positive atmosphere to this place, even though there are many tourists there.||April 27, 2016
teraob||50||My daughter is 11 and still loves playgrounds. We balance out a touring day with at least 1 visit to a playground. We found one in Hyde Park that was lovely! It was also a beautiful sunny April day and we thoroughly took advantage of the sun!This is an enormous park! We rented the bikes at one end, rode to the middle, dropped them off and walked back. This is a good idea if you want to see a lot but not walk so much, and it is free for 30 minutes!. We visited the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain which was beautiful as well as peaceful.||April 27, 2016
LMSINF||50||One of our favorite things to do when visiting London is to stroll through the park system, and Hyde Park never disappoints. We've been there in the summer and loved how green and beautiful everything was, and all the people enjoying what the park had to offer, and we attended the Christmas festival there which was fantastic. It's such a lovely area and worth taking the time to just wander and relax and enjoy!||April 27, 2016
michaelmR9532AB||50||Large. Beautiful. Water. Trees. Amazing sculptures. And speaker's corner, where people debate any topic they want to debate, without supervision is engaging. I was watching a very heated debate, which can only take place in a free country... and all of a sudden, I realized my wife had jumped into the arguments.||April 26, 2016
tuna13||50||No matter how bad the weather is you should go for a walk in Hyde Park. If it is not raining take your book with you, sit on a bench and enjoy reading it with people strolling with their kids and/ or dogs. It is so meditative to be there even for a short break.||April 26, 2016
Sue T||50||After five days of no sun we were excited to take advantage of the suns appearance. Headed out to Hyde Park, hired a Boris bike and off we went. I was too scared to ride in London traffic but this was a lovely way to spend a morning. A beautiful park on a crisp but sunny day||April 26, 2016
daveb916||40||Sat on a bench yesterday and fed the pigeons, crows and squirrels. So nice to come off the stinky London streets and breathe some fresh air. Perfect until a very rude young lady put her foot up on the bench and proceeded to pull off her stinky shoe while we were eating lunch. Some people, especially from big cities have no manners. Also watch for people riding bikes who don't slow down at intersections.||April 26, 2016

Kelly G||50||We love to visit Hyde Park when we are in London. Huge open space with lots to see & do. Great for a walk or picnic. There is a lovely cafe down by the serpentine. We hired a boat once & that was good fun!||April 25, 2016
JAbello937||30||It didn't seem special and the weather was dreary. I'm sure many would argue its appeal with me. I went around Hyde Park, Buckingham and the river area and enjoyed the vibe and culture of the people, but not impressed with the structures and sights. Side note. I find a little humor in that their money portrays the richest welfare recipients. ||April 25, 2016
Judy W||50||Decent walk from the Hilton Hotel. Large area, well landscaped. Felt safe to visit and walk. Park relaxing and opportunity for exercise. Diana memorial good. Accessible to underground.||April 25, 2016
CTYankee108||30||Sorry that I did not get to walk through the park, but passed by it several times. The monuments alone would make for a good day's walk through it.||April 25, 2016
ABjt33||50||The weather was beautiful, we enjoyed a couple of hours walking around hyde and kensignton parks! Go see the Memorial to Diana and enjoy a bit of "suntanning" in front of the Lake!||April 25, 2016
stewater||50||Hyde Park is another unusual feature of London. Where else can you feed hundreds of rare birds, paddle yourself around a pretty lakeside, touch some elegant flowers when they are in full bloom, visit the great Christmas fair and exotic rides show in December, listen to unusual comments at Speakers Corner, maybe see your favorite Rock Star Performing in the summer, watch Olympic athletic events, see the oldest sculpture of Peter Pan, and much more as the list goes on and on...||April 25, 2016
PatTheOneAndOnly||50||i came here with my kids and i loved it very much its such a lovely place to go and just sit down to relax and just take all your stress of your shoulders. my kids loved it swell as they was free to do what they want WHEN they wanted thou... how ever it doesnt cost a thing . beautiful ||April 25, 2016

Saidhbh||40||Lovely large park with options to rent a bike and cycle through, or hop in a paddle boat and paddle by the swans building their nests. There is also a riding school that have paths for horses through the park!||April 25, 2016
Doma27||50||This a BIG park and it's best enjoyed by bike since there are extensive cycle ways that allow you to experience it from end to end. Check out TfL's website and type in Santander cycles for further detials about bike hire.||April 25, 2016
digebara||50||Hyde park is bang in the middle of a busy and buzzing area. There is lots to see and appreciate. Hire one of the Santander bicycles to cycle around or take a paddle boat out. There is so much to do.I have previously organized days out with picnics and games to enjoy a cheap day out bonding with friends and family. When you need be it more drinks or food, the walk to purchase more is only a few minutes walk away. If you are lucky to live or work nearby, you could go for a daily jog around the park. It's great fun. Speakers corner is a place to visit especially at the weekends. ||April 24, 2016
Shanna B||50||This park is absolutely amazing. It is so huge. I started my walk around the park at the Albert Memorial and walked around the east side of the park to the bridge and crossed over it and then walked down the side of the river. It was a very sunny and nice day when I went and was a perfect day. This is an exceptional place for photographers to go to just take in the landscape and take pictures of the birds and all the flowers that are planted in the Princess of Wales portion of the park. This park on the east side drops right down close to Buckingham Palace and is an excellent all day adventure to explore. ||April 24, 2016
fizz-mc||40||We visited Hyde Park on the Queen's birthday to watch the cannon salute for her. It was a beautiful park, lots of paths and greenery right in the middle of the city. ||April 24, 2016
DhirajRSD||50||One of the best things I like about London is the parks; London has ample of green space for its citizens. This is best park in London must visit with a lake in it make it best of its kind. Hire a cycle and roam around the park the best way to view it.||April 24, 2016
TrotFox||50||I was so impressed with Hyde Park, from the walking trails, to the cafe, to the beautiful birds and wildlife, to the manicured gardens. I loved sitting with a cup of tea by the water and people watching and seeing the horses ride by. A very nice place to recharge from sightseeing.||April 24, 2016
vas79vas||50||What can you say about Hyde Park? Huge, clean, lovely and you cant get enough out of it. Withs its lakes, waterfalls, animals, people walking around, plenty of places for coffee and just relax under the sun if you are lucky to have some in london. Amazing experience||April 24, 2016

Headsterb||50||We visited on an overcast day but it didn't deter from the activities and beauty as we made our way the Kensington Palace. There were plenty of people enjoying the facilities on a week day. Heaps of coffee shops, water activities and children parks.||April 23, 2016
Sandygranny||40||Hyde Park is London's largest open space and covers 350 acres. It has been a destination for sightseers since 1635. One of the park's highlights is the Serpentine, an 18th century man-made lake popular for boating and swimming. Hyde Park is also where you'll find Speakers' Corner, a traditional forum for free speech (and heckling). We had a great time walking around the park and having a rest before going to visit other attractions. We wanted to see the Diana Memorial fountain and were glad we did. Also, the swans, ducks and squirrels were a joy to see.||April 23, 2016
gardner2016||40||There were a few alterations going on in Hyde Park apparently we were told a cycle track was being installed.We strolled through the park which was gorgeous the sun was setting over the serpentine and it was very romantic.

Shyor||50||This park is good for you if you like to walk a lot to explore the nature. The plants, flowers, gardens are so beautiful, you would not feel like leaving the place. Please don't forget to carry water with you as its quite a long walk, although there are bench and seats for pedestrians. My friends enjoyed the friendly birds and butterflies that easily come and seat on your neck; while I enjoyed the green leaves, massive roots and holes in the old trees. Kids were enjoying with the birds too. I would like to go Hyde Park again as I couldn't manage seeing all the plants in one afternoon.||April 22, 2016
hfulghum||50||English parks are some of my favorite in the world. Other than the ones that are true gardens, they have this feel of the countryside. Rolling greens, a lovely copse here and there (I actually got to use the word copse in a review - Huzzah!).Hyde Park presents wonder opportunities to relax - sit on the grass, take a stroll, feed the ducks/geese/swans/etc., have a coffee at the end of the Serpentine, or wander over to the Orangery for a proper high tea.A lovely place. Enjoy!||April 22, 2016

Close to Hyde Park Corner is Aspley House which was the former Duke of Wellingtons home. Owned by English Heritage, well worth a visit, check for times of,opening though. Dorchester Hotel again not far and highly recommend their English afternoon teas.||April 21, 2016

Sunil C||50||Huge park in the heart of the city. Unbelievable. Birds are so friendly and used to of human beings that they come and snatch the food you are about to feed them. So be careful. I visited this place in December, it was really cold. Grab Americano from a cafe and just walk down the part.||April 21, 2016

MiraTripz||50||A very big green area with the lake in the middle, it's very well looked after.

Eric Kristian S||40||What an amazing and big park this is in the heart of London. We entered and went by Kensington Palace and walk by the pond and all the way up to Hyde Park Corner, and experienced all the ducks and the geese. Then you see parrots and squirrels and quiet people walking with their dogs. The walk through Hyde Park was very nice as a family activity in this busy city. It offers relaxation for the mind with nice flowers, plants and animal to look at. Recommendable. ||April 17, 2016
petednuttall||40||Thought we'd get from Marble Arch to Kensington walking through Hyde Park. Lots to see. Particularly impressed by the Diana Memorial Fountain and the Albert Memorial.||April 17, 2016
Danrzr||50||This is London's biggest park. You could spend hours walking around all the parts in here. There's a variety of large open spaces and flow gardens. A good route is from Hyde Park Corner to the North West corner and on to Notting Hill.||April 17, 2016
Sebastian R||40||Only good if there is good weather but when that happens its overcrowded so it is good to see a couple of times but would not go there often.||April 17, 2016

Knowleskay||40||This is a huge green space in the heart of London. We didn't get to see all of it as we were both shattered carrying two tired boys. Lovely place to escape the bustle of the city.||April 16, 2016
yummy472||40||I found Hyde park pretty average and you'll wonder why I say that because it really is beautifully maintained.Ok, it is a beautiful park and brilliant layout but I felt like everywhere I looked people were admiring but afraid to touch and a park to me is to take the family or friend to lay about, run about or simply just enjoy.It has a grand entrance and botanical beauty so gardeners will sure to love it but a park should be more or it should be called a preserved Botanical Garden.Maybe because it is a Royal Park everyone appeared to be afraid to let loose like you might in your own local parks. I don't know if there were rules and that's why everyone seemed stiff necked but I wish I saw more kids running around playing chase, dogs caring sticks and people playing frisbee.I've created a list of things I have found myself short of and having to pay expenses eg prices for because I travelled unprepared.I hope this helps.........1.

aleviii||50||Hyde Park with its beautiful lake, the Scahler Art Gallery and the Zaha Hadid cafe are musts when visiting London. In the Park, almost across from the Hilton Hotel, is the Princess Diana Rose Garden which is a joy to behold. There are two cafe's on the lake in the hotel. The one nearest the Rose Garden is far superior to the other one which is very ordinary. You can bike on the bike paths in the park or just walk around. Don't miss this beautifully kept treasure.||April 16, 2016
Kenshare||50||A great place to take a break if you are visiting London. If the weather is fine perfect, if not take an umbrella. One of the nicer city parks in the world||April 16, 2016

yogiAylesbury||50||Very pleasant walk fresh air away from the bustle of the city in the summer there is more to do by the lake very relaxing if you like to go for a ride there is dedicated cycle lanes and you can see the horse guards leaving barracks to go to horse gourds duties ||April 15, 2016
cg2792||50||The park is soooo picturesque on a sunny day. Sadly not so much if it's raining. Really easy to get to and a perfect place for a picnic!||April 15, 2016

Davide G||50||I am in London frequently for business, I would suggest to anyone that want to relax a little bit a walk in this park.||April 13, 2016
rwillu||50||We always enjoy walking in Hyde Park when in London. In March the grass i green, there are lots of flowers in bloom and most times, in our experience, the sun is out which makes it even more enjoyable.||April 13, 2016
sirx||50||Beautiful park to go for a stroll especially if the weather is nice. You can rent bikes and cycle around the park or just sit in one of the benches and look at the squirrels or the ducks on the lake. There are a few small coffee shops and the park is ideal for picnics.||April 12, 2016
Renato C||40||Honestly it is a very nice park, but it isn't really nothign quite breathtaking.It's a perfect place to sit and relax after strolling around town, but don't expect too much of it.||April 12, 2016
Ashtangi88||50||My family and I spent a nice day walking through the park enjoying nature. Had a picnic while watching the birds. Great day!||April 12, 2016
685tajs||40||Hyde park is huge. Its nicely laid out so you have separate paths for cyclists and those that like to walk. Nice to get away from the busy center of London and unwind plus it makes more of a scenic route to get from one station to another compared to the underground||April 11, 2016
Aditi N||50||A great place for some alone time! One can spend hours at a stretch walking around the park. The Italian garden and the Serpentine lake is a beautiful example of British architecture. Feeding the birds is quite an activity but be careful, they do have a tendency to flock towards the food ||April 11, 2016
connie l||50||This park is huge! There have been so many famous concerts there that it was a life-time dream of mine to go there. You can rent bikes and ride around:)||April 11, 2016
Candy2015||40||Clean and beautiful. Had a hilarious game of hide and seek which was much enjoyed by my children especially. The park is so big but very beautiful. I promise you, there's nothing like eating ice cream in the cold in the park. Not ideal weather conditions, here in London but enjoyable nonetheless. Boating is my childhood memory and peddling on blue boats surrounded by birds is very nostalgic for me and no matter how many times I do it, it never fails to make me happy. Visiting Hyde Park is a lovely day out for the family even if it is a little foggy.||April 11, 2016
meredithsp||50||Hyde Park is a great place to explore in London. It's lovely to just walk around, but you can also get one of the Santander bikes and cycle through. The gardens and lakes are especially pretty when the sun is out. Be sure to visit the Peter Pan statue and the Princess Diana walk!||April 11, 2016
Andrea B||50||we stayed near Hyde park and made the most of the beautiful park, there was so much to enjoy, it felt like a place no matter what the weather was like you could enjoy yourself, look forward to bringing our son later in the year||April 11, 2016
nilgunoneren||50||I love feeding all animals. If you wait long enough you can feed pigeons from your hand. Do not forget to take lots of nuts and bread for birds and squirrels. Be careful of the dogs they love bread as well. ||April 11, 2016
788keithe||50||I came here with my girlfriend for a walk. The weather was nice, it was busy and very surprised how well looked after it was. We even saw parakeets flying around which we were shocked at. We even saw a lady feeding a squirrel which was nice. Will definitely be coming back here and would recommend bringing a nice picnic and going on the peddle boats in the lake.||April 11, 2016
Rororo97||40||Its a huge nice park and would love to spend more time there relaxing if I had the time as a touristWas very tempted to cycle as its too huge to walk.Saw many dogs running freely and I love the huge pond near Kensington palace.||April 10, 2016
777shinyz||30||I walked almost every inch of this place. The lake was beautiful but the lawn was a bit boring, probably because it was in March. However, I learnt a hard lesson that you needed cash/coin to pay for the public bathroom. I walked almost every inch because I wanted to go to bathroom, and I did not carry cash with me....:( Finally, I paid for food that I did not want in order to go to the bathroom at a restaurant.||April 10, 2016
AngelaStill14||50||Hyde park is absolutely beautiful. The landscaped gardens and lake with numerous swans, geese, and ducks is the perfect setting for an evening walk. ||April 10, 2016

JayneBrem||50||Beautifully maintained grounds that will appeal to anyone. There are cycle track, riding trails and plenty of space to walk, run or play frisbee. Very tranquil alongside the serpentine. I specifically visited the Diana Memorial Fountain. Very pleasant morning wandering around. Completely different to when I attended a pop concert there. ||April 9, 2016

theweeb||50||A run around the 3 royal parks is one of the best in the world. From ducks and flowers to palaces and war memorials, there are stunning world famous sights and experiences to constantly distract you from your ever increasing heart rate and lack of puff. Makes you glad to be alive!||April 8, 2016
Joanna G||50||I love Hyde Park. It's my daily escape from the city. You can walk by a lake, go to Italian Gardens with fancy fountains or walk quieter paths around trees. If you love photography it's the perfect place. Squirrels, ducks, swans, flowers... Many types of plants, trees and birds. I love it and it's a must when visiting London.||April 8, 2016
KaranPais||40||It is a sprawling place right in the heart of London. It has something for literally everyone. Running /walking/jogging /cycling tracks.Play areas for children. Benches to sit and relax.Gallery, ponds, photographic opportunities, gardens. Can spend from a few minutes upto a few hours, depending on how much time you have.||April 8, 2016

Shelley B||50||Lovely park, well kept, and full of history and wildlife. There is also plenty to do within. The Princess Diana of wales memorial fountain is here, of which you can paddle your feet in. There is coffee/tea/eats vans there too, which offer a range of different items. ||April 8, 2016
tanveerraval||40||This is one massive park and spreads across vast land. It is a nice picnic place in the summers and I am sure it will have its own charm in the winters as well though I have not witnessed it in the winters. ||April 8, 2016
suzanneg379||50||It was a lovely, sunny day for a walk. The waffles & ice cream were a hit, as well as Princess Di's memorial. Great place for a family outing or relaxing sit to eat lunch by the water. It would make for a great date too, in paddle boats :)||April 7, 2016
nouraha289||50||Looking for a place to walk? To enjoy some peace and Mother Nature? Or maybe you want to work out, have a nice meal and maybe an ice cream?Hyde park has it all! It's a very beautiful place, there's also statues from the past and nice fountains :)||April 7, 2016

Claudia M||50||This a place to slowdown in London. There people bike (in designated areas), walk and let children play. At one end of the park is Kensington Palace. There's also the Diana memorial there.||April 7, 2016
ARimar418||50||Beautiful park with a lot of options: kids' playgrounds, large green areas to do sport or just sit and relax. The lakes are nice but the Serpentine could get crowed on the weekend.||April 6, 2016
Deanna M||50||A really lovely place to have a walk. Lots of beautiful gardens and the Serpentine is full of ducks and swans. Just a peaceful place to pass an hour or two.||April 6, 2016

geleisen||30||If you want to see a park similar to Hyde Park, but with few enough people that you can actually use it as a park, go to Victoria Park near Mile End. Designed by the same person, Victoria Park has what Hyde Park has, but more and more space, because far fewer people.||April 6, 2016
lisasV7424XK||50||Great park to hang out in or bike in! The park is very clean with many things to do. Lots of wildlife and many picture worthy sights. A great place to enjoy the fresh weather!||April 6, 2016

214jpl||50||I was able to get my family into a walk through Hyde Park. I started at the Kensington Palace and crossed the Hyde Park.Try to guess your kids reaction when they spot a squirrel... great, great, great. Try to carry some peanuts and they will catch them from your hands!So big, so beautiful. ||April 5, 2016
Sarah A||50||Another place I have been to but not really appreciated. It was a great place to stop for lunch and take a walk through as we started our day in London. There is Peter pan's statue and lots of water with fountains scattered about. It leads to Princess Diana's memorial which our toddler enjoyed putting his hands in. There are beautiful flowers around and lots of places to sit and enjoy the park. There appears to be a boating lake as well but we didn't go on it.||April 5, 2016
BanffDreaming||40||This is a really beautiful park in the center of London with lots of things to see and do, including boating, visiting a gallery, having a picnic and enjoying nature.In the summer it is a lovely place to lounge in the sun and in autumn the trees are beautiful. Hyde Park is conveniently located and many areas of interest are easily accessible including the Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Palace and Oxford Street.Not to be missed if you're visiting London.||April 5, 2016
TheUrbanJoy||50||If you are in London, definitely you have to go in Hyde Park.We stayed in Paddington and we walked to Hyde Park every day, despite the fact it was December and it was cold. In that period, in Hyde Park was opened the most beautiful Christmas Market - WinterWonderland. Here we drank mulled wine and ate at burgers on one of the mini restaurants inside the Christmas Market.||April 5, 2016
AlastairCl||50||we ended up crossing hyde park to reach our hotel and it was great respite from the hustle and bustle and cars. nice just to wander||April 5, 2016
marioMersea||40||I went for a walk with my girlfriend and we totally enjoyed it. The park is clean and let's you do a bunch of outdoor activities. The perfect time to go in my own opinion is after 5pm, when the sun stops being so hot (if London is not under its common cloudy climate). ||April 4, 2016
Chandra V||50||Huge park lots to do lots to see. Well maintained.Camera is a must Beautiful fountains and swans swimming in lakes .||April 4, 2016

cprieto73||50||We spent one afternoon at this park and it was amazingly good. We relaxed just enjoying the nature around us. A must if you are in the city.||April 4, 2016
MHSV_MG||50||If you are on a budget, the Hyde Park can offer you hours of fun, watching birds, squirrels and, why not, people, while you wander around its vast grounds. The park is beautiful, and in some locations you will find it difficult to believe you are in London. I would also recommend venturing out of the Park in a few areas, like Knightsbridge, Park Lane, BaysWater and Kensington, to also experience the different flavours of the various areas that border it.||April 4, 2016
Nancy J||50||Hyde park is a place your want to go for long walks and spend time with your loved ones. peaceful and quite||April 4, 2016
J_Prizzle||50||It's almost surreal walking through Hyde park on a warm London afternoon. The animals are un phased by passers by and some are even bold enough to approach you! It feels friendly and safe and undoubtedly English. I felt privileged just to have walked through this fairytale like setting and would urge anybody in the area to do the same every chance they get!Beautiful.||April 4, 2016
mamounj2017||50||its the place where you can leave the city and enjoy the Nature , and yet you are still in the City . ||April 4, 2016
Ben S||30||It's a shame when something changes, but not for the better.Hyde Park is lovely, and is a 10-minute walk away, so it's handy and fun for my boy to scooter around.But, beware! They now charge for the toilets. Ok, so it's only 20p, but that's not the point. They've just installed brand new toilets with brand new payment gates.Since adopting Contactless with gusto, I now don't carry a wallet that takes change. Why bother, I thought.So, a nine year old desperate for the loo and no change. Just a £20 note.The guy behind me just had a £10 note.So what do we do?Fortunately, a lady was there - rather grumpy, but that's to be expected these days - and she let us through, with much tuttering.Message to the public sector. I get that you have to charge for things, but keep up with the way the world is going and offer convenient forms of payment.||April 4, 2016
YuTakimoto||50||My friend took me to this place for a stroll. It became one of my favorite places which I wanna really visit again ! There is a pond, nice cafe and Diana memorial fountain and so on. It is worth visiting not only for tourist but also families and londoners I think.I bet it will be nicer to visit in spring and summer.||April 3, 2016
LeSkiHC||50||It's a great park. I would take your time and pick up some food from outside and have a picnic I'd walk from about Queensway to Hyde Park Corner lots to see and fresh air ||April 3, 2016
Nezarrr||50||That is nice place to relax with your family ,, i go on sunday is really beautiful , there is also a restaurant very close to the river||April 3, 2016
Damien L||50||A wonderful day out at this park. A very large space away from the hustle and bustle of the city, this place has lots to do. Eateries, bike hire stations, deck chair hire, but the best of all is just people watching. On our visit a group of in-line skaters were showing their tricks and practising their moves. Great entertainment.We went to the boathouse on the Serpentine and hired a pedal boat for one hour. Surprisingly relaxing and a great way to take in the peace and quiet for a while.||April 3, 2016
kyrigllb||50||If you plan right and the day is sunny this park will be full of life from all. Cafe is nice by the pond and nice for anyone if on date or families to tourist and joggers ||April 3, 2016
Georginaoleary4||50||Having spent the 5 previous days racing around London seeing 'everything' we decided it was time to relax and just have a walk.We started with hot dogs and cup of tea for the beginning of the walk. Then we hired the pedalboats and the kids had a brilliant time pedaling us around the lake (we did start in the pedals but they wanted a go!). The kids loved being in charge and steering us around the lake.We snacked on waffles and nutella before heading to Princess Diana's fountain and then onto the playground. There was plenty to do in the playground and we stayed for over an hour.We had a great afternoon but found that the food was a little on the pricey side.||April 3, 2016
Tabby L||50||Great for walking, horse riding, playing tennis, running, or hanging out with family and friends. Very popular with picnics during the summer, so go early to get a good spot. ||April 3, 2016
pmcarlo||50||The most famous park of the city is so vast that after several visits I surely have yet to discover lots of hidden corners and attractions. I would just say to go with the flow and wander, it's perfect to spend a whole arvo on a good day.||April 3, 2016

Ulysses336||50||Hyde Park is the most important and most Central Park of London;it is in the heart of the city and a very favorite place to take long walks and to relax ; it is mostly known for the free speakers who have their special place here where up on a kind of small podium they can express their cpviews,opinions and can speak freely about whatever they want ||April 2, 2016

sonjas895||50||Hyde Park is a nice and lovely park within the city, but it's a different world. It's great to calm down and escape the city stress on a sunny day. You can also rent a boat or pedalo and paddle along the lake in the park. A nice place to enjoy oneself with an icecream.||April 2, 2016
adamekzdena||40||Hyde park is nice and calming place in a centre of noisy London. Some places were not maintained perfectly, therefore only 4 stars. And we saw there also some homeless and drunk people.||April 2, 2016
Noodlebee||50||Being that we were a family with children we often walked in the park to give the kids a break to run around and let off steam. Hyde park was not only beautiful to look at but very soothing and restful feeling. It was a nice place to relax and unwind for awhile.||April 2, 2016

Notlaw008||30||I imagine living in London you see very little green areas, how ever it's just a big park in the middle of a city. Depending on what corner you're on it can be pretty rough. Don't see what all the fuss is about.||April 2, 2016
G1681VUjohno||40||Beautiful walks through the park surrounded by stately buildings, with lots to see at the various points of the park. Great serenity away from the bustle of the city||April 2, 2016

Nimbus9||50||We were staying in a flat very close to Hyde Park and picked this location as it was very close to the park and the kids loved going here every day to just run around and play. There are 2 playgrounds at either end of the park. Additionally, we rented bicycles and rode around the park almost every day||April 1, 2016
Jake229||50||I stayed in a hostel right across from the park and was astonished how big the park was! It is a huge park with a great layout of walking/cycling trails. nearby there were several supermarkets where I packed a lunch and took a break from all of the cities hustle and bustle and had a quiet/great lunch in the park. Also there are several ponds that have an array of wildlife, so don't forget to bring the camera along! ||April 1, 2016

Xanis_Tam||50||Hyde Park is one of the capital's Royal Parks. It is a fabulous place for you to spend an afternoon especially under good weather. I did not plan to visit the Park at the beginning until I noticed it randomly right beside Marble Arch Underground. I spent about three hours in the Park together with Kensington Gardens nearby. It was definitely a relaxing place for both visitors and locals. Remember not to plan a rush schedule if you are visiting Hyde Park! :) ||March 31, 2016
Lisette M||40||The park offers nice scenery for a walk. We visited during the winter and the food stands around the park offered relief from the cold with hot coco and coffee. ||March 31, 2016

Christine L||50||This park was stunning, the amount of squirrels even was so facinating, I've never seen so many in one area. The grass was cut the walks were brilliant and it was all very stunning. ||March 30, 2016
Brittany P||50||Hyde Park is gorgeous. Always worth a visit. The birds are impressive. I spotted a blue heron while I was there. I enjoyed a quick stop at the Serpentine Bar & Kitchen overlooking the Serpentine. The park is worth a stroll.||March 30, 2016
Sarahanne08||50||My husband and I have walked in Hyde Park on a number of occasions, but on Easter Monday we did the full tour spending two and half hours strolling round the park and into Kensington Gardens. We passed many stunning sections of the park and gardens, but the ones that left an impact were the 7th July Monument, which is very powerful because of its simplicity. The circular black and white floor mosaic commemorating The Reformers' Tree which was a focal point of the protests in 1866 to give all adult men the right to vote. The Isis Sculpture, with the poignant messages engraved around its base. The whole area is so community orientated for all ages alike. We had a wonderful time and will continue to make it a regular visiting place when we are in London. ||March 30, 2016
franimallxxx||40||This is named after hyde n seek a game invented by Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde where one would go hunting the other in the Royal park.||March 30, 2016
Amin A||50||Certainly one of London's well known landmarks. This park in the centre of London city is so large that often you can see greenery as far as you can see. A blessing when you're visiting such a large city. It's beauty lies in its natural appearance throughout most of the park. There are many developed areas of course. ||March 30, 2016
Together4eternity||30||Nice park but the toilets at the Queens gate by the little cafe was disgusting,certainly needs a good clean and bleached dwn everywhere especially wen u pay to use||March 29, 2016
restlesstravelr||40||Our hotel was close to Hyde park so we had the pleasure of visiting it a few times. You can find the Serpentine Gallery there as well as a number of statues and fountains. There is plenty of wildlife and we fed the parakeets/small parrots right from our hands. a must to do.||March 29, 2016
abarnett617||40||Always a delight visiting Hyde Park, one of the most beautiful spots in London. Great for friends and / or families.||March 29, 2016
147jesso||40||I went when it was a by gloomy but there's a lot to walk around with some good views as shown in my picture. There's paddle boats which looks fun and loads a friendly local wildlife, a few of the squirrels are known to eat from you hand :) ||March 29, 2016
rensos||30||I walked this park almost diagonally but would not recommend it, especially in winter. It is flat, unimaginative and lacks character.||March 29, 2016
Karoliina L||50||The park was very well taking care of. Nice details in the park, like the memorial fountain to princess of Wales. Could spend the whole day in the park just wandering around. And even though there were lots of people, there was peaceful||March 29, 2016
topschef||40||Fun park to walk through on the way to Buckingham Palace. Lots of ducks and geese in the ponds, flowers, grass, etc. Recommend spending a 1/2 hour walking through the park on your way to see the Buckingham Palace.||March 29, 2016
EveningEater||50||Such a vast open space, lovely to wander and enjoy the air. The Spring flowers, daffs particularly were looking really lovely. Plenty of dogs getting exercise. Only down side was that there were few seats. ||March 29, 2016
Ed R||50||Picked up some Boris Bikes near Trafalgar Square (well worth a go by the way), went up the Mall, up Constitution Hill, accross Hyde Park Corner to the park itself. So long as you are sensible on the bike, and use available cycling lanes etc the roads are lovely and wide making family cycling safer than you might imagine.Hyde park itself is as you would expect - the same as all urban parks - tranquility amidst the hustle and bustle. Both are a great way of spending a couple of hours out-doors and enjoying the atmosphere and scenery of the great city of LondonYou can take the longer South/North Carriage Drive lap around the outside of the park - vehicles permitted but again is pretty calm. Or, there are shared pathways inside the park. Please though, respect the no-cycling lanes - they are there for a reason, and even have a no-bikes-allowed picture for those less familiar with English||March 29, 2016
Epernay||50||I love this park, winter, spring summer or autumn it is a place I love to run around when in London. It has lovely views, walks, memorials, cafes, boats and is filled with people of many cultures and backgrounds. Its just a nice place to be with friends, family or just on your own.||March 29, 2016
Nadi F||50||Love to walk through the park and just relax. Take a deep breath and it seems busy oxford street is very far away. In summer they always have folding chairs there that are perfect to relax and enjoy the sun. ||March 28, 2016
FaridaGK||50||very relaxing and peaceful day to spent. one of the London landmarks and beautifully organized, as see in all movies, good for kids, don't forget to feed the birds. ||March 28, 2016
singaporefinn1967||40||This is a huge space, a great place to spend a day, there is a fantastic kids playground with pirate ship and much more in Kensington gardens by the j m Barrie tree. The Diana fountain is a bit of a let down but all in all a lovely place ||March 28, 2016
Carlos-Zepeda-A||50||Definitely worth the walk when it is sunny, and exclusively sunny. The park does not look that good under the clouds. Thankfully, I didn't have any rain when I went there. Be prepared because this park is big.||March 28, 2016
Paige P||50||Rented bikes and a paddle boat at Hyde Park and it was very easy. It made for one of my favorite memories in London!||March 28, 2016
Jennifer M||50||Was staying at Lancaster gate for a week and Hyde Park is just 5 mins away Ideal for a walk or jogging in the early morning Very quiet and peaceful even to stay on a bench reading a book when the weather is good .||March 28, 2016
Corey H||40||The natural beauty and wildlife make for perfect scenery to enjoy an early evening walk in the retreating sunlight. Only drawback would be the pungent smell of marijuana in certain places.||March 28, 2016
PSiemens||50||Though the weather did not quite support my interest in walking Hyde and Kensington Parks it was still great. To feel the multi cultural energy in London is still exciting for me even after 15 visits. ||March 27, 2016

Dawn L||50||I’ve dreamed of visiting Hyde Park and the Peter Pan statue since I was a child, and it is amazing and magical. The park is delightful for walking, biking, picnicking, anything. It is giant, though, and I wish I could have explored every inch. Loved it!||March 26, 2016
katmandu84||40||Relaxing despite it being popular with tourists and Londoners alike due to it's size. The cafe next to the pond is great to grab a couple of scones, some pizza and a Pimms in the Summer. ||March 26, 2016
440kamalv||50||This is a huge park, almost 350 acres of well maintained land. The view is worth catching an eye. There is no entry fee and one can visit this place almost throughout the day. The Hyde park is a must visit if love large fields and want to enjoy long walks. ||March 26, 2016
SandraWPetrin||50||While at Hyde Park, the horses for the changing of the guard passed us. We see the children's park in Princess Diana's honor. (We were not allowed to enter, because we were not accompanied by a child) we saw the little lake with the swans. The many pathways to walk, hike, jog, or bike. You even pass by Kensington palace. Beautiful! ||March 26, 2016
Paula T||40||A very nice stroll to enjoy the calmness within the city. You can also have a bite in one of the restaurants inside while overlooking some nature.A must do in London, especially if you are lucky to have a sunny day!||March 25, 2016
BluebellSwan||30||Our hotel was right across the street so when walking to Oxford Street we decided to walk through hyde park. It was very sunny and warm even if it's still only March. Beautiful,clean and quiet. Loved it!||March 25, 2016
aokuno18||50||Hyde park is a great park for strolls, picnic, jogging or just relaxing. The morning at the park is very quiet and peaceful. I love to get a to-go pastries or breakfast foods and a cup of coffee and eat at the park.The park is even pretty on a misty or overcast days. I won't recommend it on a heavy rain day though!||March 25, 2016

penicheiropx||50||This is an excellent place to walk with friends and family. It's very calm, there are no cyclists (it's prohibited) and as a bonus, you can even watch some squirrels!I'd love to be able to walk in this park every Sunday...||March 25, 2016
Hisho99||50||it is always nice to stroll in Hyde Park watching the greenery and the duck, birds particuraly on a sunny day ||March 25, 2016

Rachel R||50||As London is quite bustlin with buildings, I have definitely started to see the value in green spaces and places where I can relax and breathe. This place is beautiful, especially on a sunny day. There's a lake with a waterfront cafe that has pretty good food and the lake is filled with gorgeous swans, ducks, and other fowl. We rented a paddle boat to cruise around the lake (not too pricey when split amongst four), which was a delight and offered more angles of the pretty scenery.||March 24, 2016
janbso||40||When I was young and was in Hyde Park, we loved to go to the corner and listen to all the speakers. Why was this ending?Always when I am in London I walk in the park. So fantastic with so much green in a big city||March 24, 2016
Ronc048||50||Stroll through while travelling from Buckingham up to Hard Rock Café. Some wildlife in the area. Be out before dark.||March 24, 2016

percyvakil||40||Hyde Park is a vast, green patch in the heart of London. It's a great place for a walk. Other than the greenery itself they have a lake/pond and a few statues and memorials that are worth seeing.This is probably one of London's largest parks.||March 24, 2016
Gaffri J||40||Last year in October i went to London and had a little spare time in the morning and went running. The park is a perfect place for running. If you run along the edges of the park and a bit into Kensington Park, you can easily get a 10k run. The circular lake is good for interval running. It's also s great place with kids. We went there when our oldest daughter was approx 1 years old and she had fun. I can highly recommend going there in spring time, with cherry blossom and various shrubs flowering. Look for the small parrots /parakeets roaming in canopies of the park. There are also several refreshment points in the park along with a few cafe's, such as The Lido cafe. I could imagine the vibe of the place in swinging 60's with weirdos, mods, fashion freaks, beatniks, live music, hippies and acid heads running wild in the park.. ☺||March 24, 2016
cprobson||50||Really good location to everything if you're planning a day of sightseeing. This place on a sunny day is amazing. Take your time and bring a picnic and you'll be happy!||March 24, 2016
Kate E||50||We were lucky with the weather you really can get away from the fast pace and have a good warm beautiful lake and the princess Diana are with the never ending stream was beautiful feeding the ducks are great plenty of things to see and we walked to Kensington Gardens which is worth a visit.||March 24, 2016
770johnnyg||40||It's worth a walk around the Serpentine, although I wouldn't recommend the café for food. The Lido used to be great for swimming, however they went under new management last year and some of the staff have got quite rude and arrogant.The Park itself is in a great location is town, I love the fact that there is a path for horses to use, cyclist, a place for footballers. A park for all right in the heart of town!||March 24, 2016
Matthew A||50||Unfortunately, in my country there aren't many parks or such beautiful animals roaming around so freely. This was an amazing experience. The park is always clean and very well looked after! Hats off to the workers who help keep this destination such a beautiful and rubbish-free area! The animals were wonderful and seems that they are well looked after. Lovely feeling of having a squirrel come up to you and take food from your hands, especially having never seen one before in my life. The swans were majestic. You can go up close to any animal and take a photo or even touch them gently if you'd like. Amazing experience. We also had a picnic in the park as one of the day was a bright shining sunny day and it was terrific! We had so much fun! Running around on the grass and playing ball. Many people on their bicycles who keep on their tracks. Lovely!Also worth mentioning is that in the period I went, there was part of the park converted into Winter Wonderland! Another amazing experience which I will leave a review for!||March 24, 2016
Agnesa B||50||Hyde park is a great place to walk with your family. It is a great place to have a picnic and see the nature in the park. The park is full of animals like squirrels, birds and deer. overall, I think that this is a great place to go with your family when there is nice weather.||March 23, 2016
EmmaGrehanxo||50||Of course summer is best but Hyde park is great for walking running or cycling through. I rented the paddle boat which was great fun.

rebeccab313||50||I've been here for some many reasons! You have to try horse riding around here, lots of companies offer a hour experience walking round Hyde park. The water looks beautiful at dawn. and when you want lunch you'll find you're right next to Oxford street.. what more do you want?||March 22, 2016
MrConvivium||50||This is a wonderful park in which to spend the day. Rent a bike and use the excellent bike paths to view the entire park, then head to Kensington Palace, the Serpentine, bring a picnic lunch and enjoy the sights||March 22, 2016

224stephanr||50||In the city there is a nice oasis, a type of getaway and this is Hyde park / Kensington park. Just a beautiful stroll through the park to revitalize the lungs and take in the trees and vast open space from within the city is very nice and unique.||March 21, 2016

Tyanne H||50||Hyde Park is for Londoners like Central Park. It is huge and full of character. There is a gallery in the middle, a lake, horses, lots to do.||March 20, 2016
Reagan10||50||We visited London in March, and stayed just across from Hyde Park. We strolled through the park on many occasions. It is not very crowded during the week. You can rent bikes for a couple pounds for the day and ride all through the park, or just leisurely stroll along the paths. The serpentine pond had numerous water fowl, including the magnificent swans. Many flower gardens. Lots of bulbs blooming in March, but a bit early for all the rose bushes.||March 20, 2016
Koalar06||50||The park is beautifull and allows the contact with nature. Perfect for outdoors activities like sports or a simple picnic||March 20, 2016
sawdustinmyshoes||40||Good anytime, on frosty mornings Hyde Park is magical, in the summer its glorious, but in the Winter when Winter Wonderland is there its at its best. Avoid weekend visits when it gets very crowded though.||March 20, 2016

Marian F||50||Needs to be a dry day but this park is beautiful. Wildlife and flowers as Spring is near. Be back in summer.||March 19, 2016
katherinel781||50||One thing London does well is include nature in the walls of the city. From the river to the parks you always feel natures presence. So take time to walk through Hyde park and sit in the sun, if there is any. And watch the birds play and children chase after them. It's about an hours distance to cross so be prepared for that. But it was a nice break from the cement. :)||March 19, 2016
BUCHU||50||Take in the fresh air and walk up to the Serpentine a Cafe. Once there, pick up your favourite coffee or tea, and enjoy on the patio overlooking the lake. The geese and other birds will delight you. On your way out, pass by Speakers' Corner to listen to free speech on a wide range of topics.||March 18, 2016
Ashley E||50||A great way to escape the hustle and bustle of it all, we packed a lunch and took to the park, walked around until we found a great spot to set down. The garden is well kept and provides for an enjoyable day out.||March 18, 2016
Jazxii||50||This park is my favourite sport to relax, meditate, reflect, have a breath of fresh air.My wife loves it, and our children love it even more. We enjoy the greenery, play football, frisby and feed ducks and squirrels.We enjoy a hot drink with a sandwich by the serpentine lake.The seasonal Winter Wonderland is even more glamorous and fun.We never can get bored of this beautiful park.Thanks,||March 18, 2016
Gary T||40||I biked around this park on rented bicycles with my daughter and some other families. Renting a bike is inexpensive ( 2 pounds) and easy. It is really a fun way to see one of the nicest parks I've ever seen. ||March 18, 2016
Amber R||50||I love going for a stroll through Hyde Park! There are so many routes you can take with each one taking you on a different journey! Don't forgot to walk over to the lake to see all the different birds and people using the paddle boats! This is great for all ages and for first dates, anniversaries through to relaxing by your self!||March 18, 2016
Paulcaulfield||50||This park could be anywhere in the country but no its bang in the middle of London and what a beautiful park it is once away from the edges of the park you almost forgot where you are, The Diana memorial is lovely as is the serpentine and the endless paths through the park.||March 17, 2016
Jasmine K||50||It took 45 minutes of walking through this park in hopes to find The Peter Pan Statue! It only took us that long because 1) the park is quite large 2) we were constantly distracted by the beautiful surroundings. Once our destination was reached, I just cried silently to myself in awe. This statue represented so many childhood memories of Peter Pan and my wish to soar with him to Neverland. It was a beautiful moment and such a breathtaking park.||March 17, 2016
Keith D||50||Wonderful place, and in such a wide expanse of land. There are some interesting statues near the serpentine , also the history of the bridge is equally so. On a Sunday, speakers corner is worth a visit to hear people voice their concerns on various topics.||March 17, 2016

Travelingwisely||50||We went for a wander through Hyde Park on a Sunday morning and for a while felt as if we were on a deserted moor, with a low fog hanging over everything, not another soul in sight, and only the sounds of birds around us. Then the fog lifted and we began running into people out jogging, walking their dogs, and even riding horses, and we spent a pleasant half hour by the lake watching and feeding the ducks and swans. After that we wandered over to Speakers' Corner, where there was a small crowd. But we weren't impressed by the haranguing tone of the speaker, and we left quickly. Still, the first two peaceful hours were a thoroughly enjoyable restorative experience!||March 15, 2016
akhalifi||30||great place for walk and relax, you will see most of people do excerice there.chouldnt stay more as I had to see all London and only I had 2days, the origenaly tour busses station in front of the park.||March 15, 2016
Salahnaqi||50||The hyde park is a fun relaxing for all sitting on a bench or on the grass or walking around is a relaxing time , boats for the lake ride " summer " is best otherwise is cooold in winter, a great restaurant for breakfast or brunch or dinner , and loot to do just look at the map on the entrances.||March 15, 2016
Linda Y||50||A beautiful public park that you want to go everyday and you won't be bored. There're a wide spectrum of different arrangements and sceneries and it is just huge. Some parts of it are so elegant and so well maintained like a private garden, while other parts of it are well fit for multitude-activities. To me, this should be the model for all parks!||March 14, 2016
Krista W||40||I decided the day was so nice that I'd walk through Hyde Park/ Kensington Gardens, after visiting the Victoria & Albert Museum, back to Paddington Station. Even in March I found the walk easy and beautiful and I walked it three times. My trip was a 30 minute walk from Cromwell Road, where the museum is, to Sussex Gardens where I was staying.I'm sure that when the flowers come up it will even more beautiful. Here are a few photos from my walk.||March 14, 2016
Ben T||50||The Swans are beautiful. The park was clean and spotless and nice walk around. I even stopped and talked to locals about dogs and things to do. The people were more then willing to talk.||March 14, 2016
HaDa2000||50||Go there on Sunday, and you will see people at the Speakers Corner freely expressing themselves. The park is of good size, so prepare to walk. If not, bring a blanket and just soak in the sun or breeze. ||March 14, 2016
Laura T||40||We stayed super close to this park and I wish the weather was warmer for us to picnic. We went to Kensington first and the walked out the back towards Hyde park. The park was open and huge. It is nice to see dogs off their leashes. I wish we were allowed to at home. Even the dogs have more manners here.||March 14, 2016
rockdoc000||50||Great to see the buttercups out in full spectacular. The local bobbies were kind enough to pose for a photo with the Aussies on tour ||March 14, 2016
sunrisen||50||Like most parks I discover something different each time I visit. It is especially appealing in the morning before the crowds arrive. In good weather take a picnic and find a quiet spot under a tree. Stroll across from Bayswater side to Knightsbridge......wonderful to escape the ghastly London traffic by doing so. Have never taken a boat on The Serpentine, funny how you miss these things as a true Londoner.||March 13, 2016

Makelainen||40||The park have a lot to offer and vary varied grounds. Flowers, water and recreative areas blend nicely together and you can expand the experience by including Kensington Gardens and get even more activities to do. Bring your children as well. But at night you should be careful ||March 12, 2016
C W||50||So nice to have a great park in the middle of the city. We walked from Marble Arch to Kensington Palace on a chilly March day. My only complaint is that it is easy to find yourself on the wrong path as they are not really all that well marked. But that is part of the fun of being in the park, to wander and enjoy the bucolic setting in the middle of a bustling city.||March 12, 2016
Katrina L||40||There is really something for everybody here.Walk around and enjoy the beauty and peace...Or hire a bike and enjoy the fun of it all....Don't forget speaker corner on Sunday mornings.Also artists display there art on the outside of the park- Bayswater road side on Sunday's too.||March 12, 2016

sanojj2016||50||The biggest park in London. Boating was something that the kids enjoyed. So easy to reach. A must visit.||March 11, 2016
ohthatkimberley||50||Beloved by locals year-round (it hosts Winter Wonderland around Christmas), this park comes even more alive in the summer with events such as the James Bond Car Exhibition, festivals (The Proms, Party in the Park, etc.),picnic celebrations, and all locals flocking here to sunbathe when there's good weather. I've grown up going here, so have made many memories here. Don't miss the opportunity to come here if you can, even if it's just for a hot chocolate by the river or a stroll. Great for rollerblades and bicycles!||March 11, 2016
simerb2015||50||Visited Hyde Park on a Sunny Sunday. Beautiful Park with stunning blooming flowers, benches across the lake which has several swans. Boating available as well. Also, has some barbecue restaurants and a small cafe. DO visit when in Central London.||March 10, 2016
karanstaples||40||walked through hyde park to get to Diana's memorial garden. what a delightful tranquil park it is ans so close to busy oxford street||March 10, 2016
Melissa R||50||Talking a walk through this park was an incredibly surreal part of my trip to London! It was a brisk, chilly day, but the birds were chirping and the sun was shining, and there were dogs playing. It was a very peaceful visit. I walked through the entire park with the goal to see Kensington Palace, which I did see apparently, I just didn't realize it so didn't even get any pictures. It's definitely not as palatial as expected! ||March 10, 2016
752fadya||40||Don't think there is much to add here besides what others have said already. We had a long morning walk here, in relatively chilly March morning. The park is absolutely gorgeous, with sprawling green spaces and actually almost disconnects you from the city around you. The Italian Gardens is a must see area here. The Albert memorial was stunning as well. The Kensington Palace is part of the park as well, but we did not get to visit it this time around. I would recommend||March 10, 2016
SannaK||40||A really nice park for walking around, or going for a run in the evening. It could use more lighting in the evenings, though!||March 10, 2016
Bryanmarbella||50||A gorgeous walk around the Serpentine. Surising good food by the bridge, especially the wood fired pizza and the outdoor BBQ burgers...||March 10, 2016
verenasc||50||Beautiful park with nice lakes and very nice flowers. You can already see and admire a lot of flowers and blossoming trees. Perfect place to relax or go running. Especially in the morning. There are plenty of people running so completely safe for women to go their. ||March 9, 2016

Well-travelled-6713||40||I do love a nice stroll in Hyde Park. We were there during the Winter Wonderland Festival and it was a riot of rides and vendors and food and beer. Lovely. Whether in the cold or in the rain or those glorious moments when the sun comes out. Hyde Park is a great place to spend an hour or two wandering about. Lovely.||March 9, 2016

Pierre3007||40||With Hyde Park being so close to the shopping precinct of Oxford St, it is easy to visit and well worth exploring. There are lots of things happening in the park, particularly on weekends.||March 7, 2016
tesslock||50||The walks are well organised for all, although it would be helpful if the skateboarders would use the cycle lane and not the walking lane, maybe signage to make this clearer to parents! The cafes, especially the victorian boathouse type place have a busy, happy feel. Amazing to see green parrots in the trees in the middle of London.||March 7, 2016
Haveyoumetmissjones||50||I love a morning run around the serpentine. Great park to absorb the excitement and vibe of london! Beautiful park with lots to see and do!!||March 7, 2016

kueb_kueb||40||Actually i couldn't see much of the "original" hyde park because i was at Christmas time there and a big Christmas Markt was was build.Its a huge place where you can walk hours through the park. So if u need some fresh air and some time for u, away from the people on the oxfort street, u will be happy here^^||March 6, 2016
ericjohnc2016||50||So picturesque! Easy to spend several hours walking through. Lots of places to grab a coffee while enjoying the greenery. ||March 5, 2016
Helena G||30||I would definitely recommend skip Hyde Park and go to Green Park if you are around the area. Hyde Park is not such a thing, it is just very big.||March 5, 2016

louo446||50||There's not much more I can put other than the heading of this review. I love this park. It is beautiful, spacious and a break away from the hustle and bustle of London. There are lovely places to eat (although a bit pricey) and places to grab coffee. Suitable for all ages. ||March 4, 2016

NiclasF37||30||The season didn't allow us to get the as it would be If you experience it in the spring. Still, a Nice place for a stroll and a getaway from the hectic town for an hour.||March 3, 2016
Mary S||50||My husband and myself love this Park. We never get bored of looking at the gardens and the walk along the Serpentine. We always have a pit stop at the Lido cafe, great cakes and coffee. It's handy to have a few nibbles for the wildlife, the squirrels are very cheeky.||March 2, 2016
Gidons51||50||Take 2 hours to go through the endless green grasses of the park . Enjoy the fresh air and don't miss the serpentine. A beautiful walk ! ||March 1, 2016
Phill_The_Bear||50||Forgive the pun, saw Blur live in Hyde park. Beautiful well kept place, hopefully see them again here in the future.Would recommend the park just for a stroll round anyway ||March 1, 2016
Intrepid_Traveler13||40||I seem to spend a lot of my time in Hyde Park when I visit London. Walking, running, visiting the Swans, or the funny ducks who sit in the trees. I've run across some wonderful art installations, some lovely gardens, and an amazing artsy installation in Kensington Palace. Yes, there is an actual Palace in the park. There are many treasures to stumble upon. Like the cottage of the lucky groundskeeper who gets to live in the park. Can you imagine?? Or the Queen's guard doing drills on and off horses. You can have hot chocolate, or paddle around in a boat. You can run a race, or ride a bike. Or just rest on the grass. It's a nice place to spend some time.||March 1, 2016
newmex512||50||sat by fountain on a sunny day in February, felt like I was in a painting, park is massive but a must see||March 1, 2016

19Lilianam89||50||This is fab place to go have a walk on less cold day, you just feel apart from all the busy London and you can actually relax, you can find little coffee stands around and if lucky day it's sunny you can even lay down and relax. ||March 1, 2016
Silent_Serviceman||40||This made the walk to and from where I was going a lot more pleasant. I'm not a city person so this made my environment quite a bit more comfortable.||March 1, 2016
LoveSunBeachMountain||50||It has many different facets. Just like one would say Central Park is great, the same can be said about Hyde park for the same reasons. It is huge and you can spend an entire day roaming about there. In the summer it is lovely in the winter it is barren but still neat.||February 29, 2016
laupc20||40||A mandatory and pleasant walk if you go to London. I didn't see any squirrel... It is a quiet and spacious place to go with kids, with friends or alone.||February 29, 2016
Jenny W||40||A cold but dry day let us wander in the park in the day light and then enjoy the winter wonderland in the dark. Good atmosphere very family friendly||February 29, 2016
Masha_Stan||50||It's an amazing place to feel relaxed and not to worry about anything. Just be part of it. Just watch locals jogging. Just watch tourists talking pictures. Just go and see Peter Pan. A very nice place. Lots of trees, flowers, ponds ...||February 29, 2016

Alfonso A||50||This is "the Park", it is really incredible how you can be in the countryside being in the center of London. Lovely places to enjoy a meal, rest, walk||February 28, 2016
Depa38||50||A gorgeous must see park in London. It is fab in all weathers, but especially in the summer time.Can get busy at times so be careful of the time you go, especially during peak hours.But I would highly recommend this park on London||February 28, 2016
sheepygold||50||Hyde Park is a massive free attraction that is lovely on any dry day. There is a great deal to see. I suggest you walk along the Serpentine where you can hire a boat if you wish and swim at certain times of year at the Lido. You can visit the Diana memorial and there are some less visited but beautiful rose and formal gardens near Hyde Park Corner. I would suggest you bring your own food and drink as the cafes are overpriced and a bit disappointing although the cafe at the Knightsbridge end of the Serpentine has an amazing view. The toilets in the parks which are not attached to a cafe now charge for entry so carry change.||February 28, 2016
Emily D||50||This park is beautiful and if you have not seen squirrels before you will be sure to have seen plenty after a stroll through here!||February 27, 2016
Sedger33||50||For open space, a bit of rough grass land, woods and monuments this park has it all. Well worth a visit if you are in London.Always a favourite place for a stroll, a hangout or some contemplative space.||February 27, 2016
EdinburghShoegal||50||It's so lovely to have so many parks in a major city, this one being a short stroll from our hotel. We visited Kensington Palace which is set in the lovely park. Plenty of space to stroll and take in the beauty. ||February 27, 2016

AntonisV723||50||Event during the winter, this park is beautiful. When the sun is shinning, its ideal to go by the lake, take a grab at the restaurant inside and generally hang out there.||February 27, 2016
9978kelly||50||I have been to Hyde park several times it is a lovely park but very very big! i went here on a Taylor Swift concert and i was very good lots of space!||February 26, 2016
JasonJ88||30||Don't get me wrong this is a lovely park with a beautiful lake and monuments but our recent visit was marred by ongoing returfing which spiols the park's beauty.It has to be done I know just a shame it was on our visit.||February 26, 2016
Jennifer V||50||I love Hyde park! I used to come here often in my lunch break as its lovely and relaxing place to come to unwind. There are loads of friendly squirrels which are really cute and will come right up to you to feed, I used to give them small bits of an apple and there was one lady who would come on her bike with a big bag of nuts and they would run all over her!! The grounds are extremely well kept and there are often events going on. The cafe is lovely and overlooks the lake and the ice cream in the summer is delicious!||February 26, 2016
Pamela A||50||This is a beautiful park. It is a great park for children, families and singles. Dogs run everywhere. The grass is so green and the trees are outstanding. It is a very large park. Now I see why it is so famous. Must see while you're in London||February 26, 2016

cotton32||40||This park is close to the palace and is very well kept with nicely tended flower beds.

Steve C||50||We were only going to go for a quick look and ended up walking for miles! In fact we walked from one end to the other to see the Marble Arch. Once again you must visit the park if you get a chance as it is a real treat, especially if you have been holed up in the busy streets of London for a while and just need a break from it all.Steve C||February 24, 2016
VictoriaR7||50||Walking through Hyde Park in the fall takes you to a beautiful, colourful piece of heaven in the middle of busy London. Fantastic statue of Prince Albert covered in gilt at one end, with beautiful treed walking paths and ponds covering acres of park, finishing at the other end with Kensington Palace. Highly recommend for families, animal-lovers, couples and friends.||February 24, 2016
Alex M||50||The park is amazing with so much to see and do. Great for a rainy day but even better if the sun is shining. It's a really big park and we all enjoyed it||February 24, 2016

Brandon K||40||If you are a bird lover, the parks in this city house a lot of different birds to discover. Also plenty of space to walk, run, bike, or even rent a paddle boat!||February 24, 2016
Nicky S||50||A absolute delight to run through this beautiful park. The scenery is wonderful, and extremely beautiful scenery . ||February 23, 2016
Becky R||50||You can't go to London and not stumble across Hyde Park! The have wonderful fountains and memorials around the park to visit. There are maps everywhere to guide you through the park, which is amazing. Even though it is in the heart of the city, it is very peaceful to walk around. I would also recommend renting a bike to cycle through the park. They have great bike paths for you to take. ||February 23, 2016
LikePankaj||40||Be prepared to walk a lot in this park. Has boating activity in the centre of the park. Glad to see so many kids enjoying there. A lot of them learn skating, cycling etc in this park.||February 23, 2016
Vicki M||50||it's huge and beautiful to walk through. We went when it was cold but would be even better in the summer. ||February 23, 2016
Chandra Sekaran M||50||It will be very special for kids. Very big to play. Lake and Pond are awesome, can see beautiful birds. Kids will like it. ||February 23, 2016
Menachery||40||One thing you must do when in London is to visit the Hyde Park, preferably on a Sunday and hear some interesting speeches at the Speaker's Corner and even ask some questions and participate in the impromptu debates, as I did when I visited London for the first time. Henry the 8th had confiscated the huge park area from the Westminster Abbey monks and made it a deer park for hunting - no entrance for the public. That was in 1536. Hundred and one years later Charles First opened the park to the public. The Sunday Trading agitation and the Suffragette's agitation for vote for women are only two of the famous gatherings there. Marx, Lenin, and Orwell and a plethora of famous people used to speak from the Speaker's Corner to give vent to their original ideas. A well dressed man who claimed that he was from Surinam was speaking (in excellent English) against the English and the queen when I first went to the Park. I interfered to ask him some questions. He used somewhat bad but imaginative language to mock at a young English pair kissing nearby. When I objected he invited me to come and share the venue. I still think he was really an Indian. The many other attractions of Hyde park, probably along with the adjacent Kensigton Gardens the world' third or fourth largest city park.||February 23, 2016
TravellingAddict||50||I love running and this is the pefect park to do it in. Whether its late on a summers night or in pre-dawn darkness on a chilly winter morning - it is safe and offers a fabulous range of running from quick 5km to longer 10kms. ||February 23, 2016
Asp_91||50||Really nice for a relaxing walk ! Just grab a coffee and enjoy the view for hours! The animals and this view of nature will fill your soul with calmness !||February 21, 2016
ann2545||30||Looked better on films then in real life, in reality it's not much to see so not worth the trip all they way to london.||February 21, 2016
candmjax||50||Far to big to see it all in a day if you've got any other plans, but it's a great way to kill some time, especially if you've got a history book on it, we just printed pages off the internet and referred to them as we were walking.||February 20, 2016
keciaf2015||50||We went to their festival they do over Christmas in 2014We love Christmas time so it was such a great experience for us ||February 20, 2016
Mike F||40||Easy to access and we'll kept, this is great for walking the dog or just having a walk, wild life all over, lots to see and plenty of cafes etc to visit, you might even see some of the household cavalry if you are lucky.||February 20, 2016
Del C||50||so much to see as you walk around the park, a fave stop off for me and I walked through it 4 times this visit, so much wildlife and surprised at the amount of Parquets flying around. noisy little buggers too.. ||February 20, 2016
WiltonL1999||40||One of the world's most beautiful parks, akin to say Central Park in New York, everything about it is beautiful including the serpentine lake and the serpentine gallery; the only real problem is it ms inaccessibility when it is rented out - so unfair - beware not to visit then, otherwise enjoy it and its sister in northerly sibling Regents park.||February 20, 2016
K5274MMrachelp||50||Lovely park. We go with two young kids and we hire bikes and take scooters for kids so can travel the whole park. The rose garden is beautiful in summer. Views of the sunset over the serpentine are lovely. No visit to London complete without a visit to the park.||February 20, 2016
Heidi L||50||Beautiful, Historical, Busy and quiet. We saw sqirrells and swans and just about every type of bird in England.||February 19, 2016
charliem346||50||Great place to walk, nice, peaceful and romantic :) haven't seen much of the park though as it was a lot to get round and very cold. But taking a steady stroll from Paddington to knightsbridge was a great start to my day.||February 19, 2016
skyeb_11||50||You can go for a walk with the kids, a run through the park, a bike ride or dog walk and still see hundreds of years of history and feel like you are in the middle of the countryside. Stay near the park whenever you are in London, it just makes sense. There is an incredible accessible playground also near by Kensington castle. ||February 19, 2016
Lucia J||50||I love Hyde park. It is easy to access and so beautiful. Me and my 3 friends had a lovely birthday picnic there in June. It was so nice and quite there. There are a few small shops to grab a fast coffee or some sandwich. There is a lovely lake and people can hire the pedalos or rowing boats. Overall fantastic place to go to hide from the busy city .||February 19, 2016
chloe187111||50||It's à good place to have a walk, take some nuits with you, the squirels are sooooo cute and the will come on you to have some fond ;)||February 19, 2016
Brookesey||50||I love this park with such history and so many great sights as you walk around here. Especially nice in the summer. I will visit here time and time again ||February 19, 2016
Gavin T||50||The park itself is very green. However, when we were walking through this park, as well as the adjacent Kensington Gardens, it was in the middle of Storm Imogen. So, up to 60mph winds and rain had us ducking for cover often. That said...there were still hoardes of geese, swans and ducks on the water. There was a guy on one of the paths next to the water who was feeding the swans. No joke, the swans would come out of the water, let the guy pet them, and they they would take the food. We thought it was because they were familiar with him, as maybe he did this daily and had earned their trust. This was until he gave a couple passers-by, who were looking on, some bread crumbs too. The swans came over to them, took the food and let those people pet them too. As something we just happened upon, that was actually really awesome to see. Made it easy to ignore the wind and rain! The park itself is also really nice. Lots of pathways, and a lot of very green grass. Had it not been such a terrible storm, we would have probably stayed in the park a little longer. ||February 19, 2016
MrSofthreebridges||50||Full of surprises, formal parts, expansive grassland, secret gardens, horse riding, formal and informal statues.||February 19, 2016
ojonesjr||50||We did the advanced purchase of the champagne experience. The experience was amazing! you can see the entire city. The attendant took pictures as well. We were in the fast lane no waiting. ||February 19, 2016
Suzanne V||40||Spend all day in the park walking around, boating on the lake, having a picnic, lunch, dinner, coffee or just relaxing by the banks of the Serpentine. Close to Oxford Street if you decide to go shopping. Close to Buckingham Palace if you want history. Trafalgard Square is not too far either. Host to various gigs/events such as Winter Wonderland.||February 19, 2016
Paul L||40||Nice place to wander, very large but surrounded by many landmarks and tourist spots. Personally we went to Buckingham palace then went to Westminster Abbey (5 min walk from corner of HP) .. lots of places to sit also if the feet are hurting. lots of woodland animals to watch, and many dogs being taken for walks. All in all a nice relaxing place||February 19, 2016
Ian J||40||Be like me i walked from Marble Arch to Knightsbridge it as a good 30 to 45 finite walk but it so lovely walking through one of London`s great parks, again like all our great parks there is plenty of seating. As one gets close to Knightsbridge your see the serpentine stop and have a seat or a cuppa. ||February 18, 2016
KarolaRS||50||I love walking around Hyde Park. From the manicured flower beds and pruned trees of Kensington Gardens at one end to the wild and unkempt plains at the other to the Albert Memorial and Speaker's Corner. Love Hyde Park.||February 18, 2016

dalekjdgc||50||I went to London with my dad last summer and we took a walk and cycle around Hyde Park. It is a stunningly beautiful place. It is such a peaceful and relaxing place to walk. You really feel at nature and there is even some extraordinary wildlife there. You can take a nice cycle round Hyde park seeing the gorgeous lake and wonderful scenery. It is such a great place to just forget all your worries and have a nice walk. I recommend it to people who enjoy peaceful and relaxing walks in the countryside.||February 18, 2016
CaribbeanFan79||40||We cut thru the park on our way back to Kensington and our hotel. Beautiful park and area cut out in the middle of the city. ||February 18, 2016
LizzyHW||50||As soon as the sun is out most of London flocks to the park. It's a great place for a pic box and to drink and sit and people watch.The pedalos and rowing boats on the lake (serpentine) are great fun and relatively good money for the times you get Lots of interesting people meet in the park like 80s roller blazing gangs listening to music- makes you feel like something out of fame. And other weird and wonderful groups of people doing bizarre health activities (some look like they're on land skis?!?) a great place to people watch and enjoy the sun ||February 18, 2016
Louise J||40||Always good for a lovely walk in London, picnics are very enjoyable here on a nice day too! We went and got some snacks from Harrods and then sat and enjoyed them in the park then had a lovely walk. Nice to walk through the park and soak up the atmosphere and sights||February 18, 2016
skinny57||50||we were in London staying for just one night , hotel was just by Hyde park so we went for a walk to blow away the cobwebs on a cold crisp morning. It was 9 am but was hardly anyone around only morning joggers, we had a long walk around taking in all the lovely waters, all the water ornaments and features, statues and all the great information to what all the features are as well as explaining about what animals and birds you can find in this wonderful place, we watched in wonder as the swans were being hand fed by people all birds were so tame and friendly. We could hardly believe we were in the centre of London it was so unreal.We see Queens guards practising in the grounds, but i think the best experience was the wild Parakeets birds that were all flying around the park, so amazing to see these parrots in large numbers flying around with all the other wild birds, then we see a whole tree covered with them and two people feeding them monkey uts, some brave birds took straight from their hands others just swooped and took them, a truly amazing experience, cant wait to go back again in slightly warmer weather. Visit this lovely park and marvel at all the works of art even Diana s memorial water feature was good and all so well looked after.||February 17, 2016
luhen||40||Relax and enjoy a stroll with plenty to look at. Famous landmarks - stop for a coffee and take the landscape in. Lakes, statues, gardens etc will captivate you.||February 17, 2016

Jayjarrod2002||50||My daughter and I walked to here the day the tubes where on strike in July 2015. We hired a couple of bikes and rode round the whole park. It was amazing. Grabbed Lunch from boot and had a picnic lunch. We even had a squirrel join us 3 feet away. The bike rack were very hard to find and need more signage for them. It was funny watching all the businessmen riding from one end to the other with their briefcases.||February 16, 2016
lisa-1-gibbs||50||Loads of tourists everywhere nice to see horse lanes people going up and down with their horses, really lovely coffee shop with good views from the seating area outside, roller skaters with their music showing their skills and dance moves .!

BillCRochdale||50||Hyde Park as everybody knows is a must, an oasis of calm in this nest of human endevour. But what I wanted to let people know about was the appearance of three green parakeets that brightened up my morning. First time I have seen these and I visit the capitol weekly, maybe I just have not noticed them and they have been there for years||February 16, 2016
Lrp62||50||We were staying in London the night before Christmas Eve and spent the evening at Hyde Park Winter Wonderland. It was magic! There were a variety of places to eat, little Christmas markets, rides and the lights were stunning. We were very lucky with the weather as it was a clear night and we had a great time.||February 16, 2016
dawns448||40||Hyde Park is a great place to sit a chill and enjoy a coffee. Sit on one of the many benches and watch the world go by. If your lucky you may get to see the horse guarded carriages being pulled through the park, play the guessing game as to which Royal (or official) may be inside them.Walk along the paths and wonder at one of the many statues there is within the park. Stop in the rose garden, smell the roses if there in bloom.There is so much you can do within this open space, and it's free to enter and wonder through.||February 16, 2016
Darren1066||40||I was staying in a hotel that was very close and had an hour or so to kill before going to catch the train, so thought a Sunday morning walk would be a nice idea. Considering it was after 10am I was surprised at how quiet the park was. yes there were horse riders, cyclist, tourists, dog walkers and runners, but the space is so large you never feel crowded. There are many things to do in the park, from the simple things like feeding ducks, to having a ride on a pedalo. I can easily see how you can spned the day gere, but i did not have time. If I was in the area again, I would definatly return.||February 16, 2016
larsbryldtc||50||Hyde Park is a great place to relax and take some long walks. You always feel there is space around you although it is well visited. I recommend that you take you time walking through. ||February 16, 2016
556madif||50||It's a good place to drink coffee and just enjoy London scenery if you're a tourist. It is also a good place for young children to stretch their legs and enjoy being themselves as sometimes they can't be in stuffy London.||February 16, 2016
Erika L||50||We are lucky to have such a large park with a lake right in the middle of London, I have walked many times from Marble Arch to High Street Kensington via Kensington Gardens. One can get to Hyde Park Corner, where there is a Rose Garden to Marble Arch where ne is in Oxford Street within a maximal 10 minutes walk or if one goes by car one can go from Exhibition Road Kensington to Edgware Road in 5 minutes avoiding all that traffic.It is also the venue of concerts and the much loved Winter Wonderland, which I visited twice this year, One can relax read a book, watch the people go by and there are plenty seats. It is a good place to get away from the busy roads in London||February 16, 2016
sacredgypsy||40||Hyde Park is a bigger version of Central park in New York... (loads bigger)There's loads to do from walking, cycling, feeding the duck, photography, meeting friends, grabbing a bite to eat.. and oodles more. ..The park is vast and although many visit it doesn't get overrun or cramped. I loved spending my free time walking throughout the park... nice and relaxing. .. would recommend!||February 15, 2016
RamblinJudi||50||Lots to see and enjoy. Paved walking/jogging paths. Lots of folks use this park and their dogs love it!||February 15, 2016
markgI362MN||50||This was a nice Sunday morning walk. Did go to see speakers corner but due to the drizzle no one was there at 11am.We walk down to the serpentine and then on the Princess Diana memorial and then on the Albert hall. blew the cobwebs off and then it was coffee time.||February 15, 2016
Stefan Z||50||I had not so good waehtrer at my stay in London. But a walk through this park was greateful and gave me a power up. I saw quiet much animals on my walk.||February 14, 2016
neilmw1||50||I walked through the park from Kensington Gardens (get off the tube at High Street Kensington), past the palace and up at a diagonal to Marble Arch. I recommend walking through the palace gardens, some great photo opportunities if that's your thing. I walked on to Round Pond which is really nice, plenty of open areas - if you have a dog I am sure they would love it! From there I walked up to the Italian Gardens, again these were fantastic and I was lucky to get a sunny day and some good photographs. You could easily spend all day here on a warm day. Only thing to remember is that the toilets do require payment (20p at time of writing), keep some change with you!||February 14, 2016

Travelsalot05||40||An enormous park smack in the middle of London. Is everyone's backyard. Lovely for strolling, and what a fine entertanment it is to go to Hyde Park Corner and listen to/participate in one of the vigorous conversations, or debates, people conduct there. Free speech at it's best...or worse, depending on who's talking!||February 11, 2016

joanbabot||50||After one full day of walking around on a busy commercial streets in London, it is always relaxing to spend and hour or so, relaxing the views and the sounds of silence at Hyde Park, only broken by the high speed of cyclist crossing Hyde Park.||February 10, 2016
nth-sth||50||I spent every single evening I could in this park during the summer. I lived in Central London and felt away from it all here, on the fields by the lake. A picnic, wine, tunes. There's nowhere better on on a warm evening and it's a cheap date too! The events they have here are amazing too and very well organised. I've been to a few high profile concerts & Last Night of the Proms is amazing and not as stuffy as you may think.||February 10, 2016
debrasb46||40||Have been to a few musical events here.. It's a great space.. Sound is good.. Stage and views are good.. There are never enough toilets and the beer and food is always expensive, but that's the same everywhere! Hyde park is a great location for transport and fairly cheap accommodation if you want to stop locally. ||February 10, 2016
Lenka S||30||Don’t get me wrong, this is a nice enough park, but definitely not on top of the nicest parks in London. It is well known to tourist, but if you are just visiting London you are probably better off going to a different one, Regents park maybe of some other Royal parks which in my opinion are much nicer and offer more activities than Hyde park which is mostly just wast green space, good for walking but the activities are more scarce. If you venture here, you are probably better off going all the way to Kensington gardens, which is connected but in fact a separate part of the park and probably the nicest one.||February 10, 2016
Paulina K||50||They have lots of green place to do picnic and play with children. I like winter wonderland in the winter time. When we had free time we always going the.||February 9, 2016
sandyjMoraira||50||Even in early February there are lots of people about, childrens football matches, runners, dog walkers, and even a (very) few people at Speakers Corner! All in all a lovely walk in the pale winter sunshine. The park is very well kept, and gardeners must work all year round to keep it in tip-top shape. It takes a good 2 hours to walk around the whole park, so lots of time to take it all in. The Albert Memorial looks as if it has just been painted, in gold!||February 9, 2016
Ritsy B||50||A huge green park right in the middle of the hustle bustle of London.Beautiful green gardens,funtains,lakes...and not at all crowded.perfect way to start a morning.||February 9, 2016

babs089||50||On a cold sunny morning in January we walked from Kensington Palace through to Buckingham Palace, the lakes are full of birds and dogs are kept on leads when near them. It is such a wonderful open space, being well cared for, police horses were being exercised and it was a real breath of fresh air away from the city.||February 9, 2016

IanSeph||50||There are so many different parks in one, its worth spending a full day here. There's the east side with it flank along Park Avenue which in the summer is home to a variety of concerts and big stage events, and in the winter home to an ever increasing Winter Wonderland. There's the Serpentine lake with its boating, swimming, and duck feeding. Then, on the west side it become Kensington Gardens, with the Round Pond, and Kensington Palace to explore, and it's Orangery to eat cake in. What's not to like?||February 9, 2016
Baldur Tumi B||40||You can store your luggage at Victoria and jog london. I ran up and down the Thames and Hyde park. Note that the efffects staff are really particular about number of articles, stuff everything into one!||February 9, 2016
gauravonlineonline20||50||Great place to just take a walk, have discussions or just do some exercise. You are greeted with nice Italian fountains at the entrance and beautiful white swans and ducks swimming in the lake. There are cafes and restaurants inside the park so you can grab a coffee while taking a walk along the lake. Overall, a nice, calm and green place in the midst of busy London. The park is very close to the paddington station, which is a very well connected station of the london tube network.||February 9, 2016

Margaret Mary O||50||Seeing this picture takes me back to the days when I was little, walking with my father after Sun lunch. Hyde Park was originally an area for hunting, hence all the lodges situated on the perimeter. The Serpentine -situated on the southern edge - is a part of the R. Westbourne, now underground, the top end of which has been turned into the fountains. The road at the bottom of the park was formerly called Rotten Row - I don't know the reason 4 this - and it used to be a very fashionable place to take a walk for young ladies, or debutantes,as they were called, especially on a Sun AM.At the northern end of the park, you will find Speaker's Corner. This is a very popular place to go and hear the various speakers, esp on a Sun morn. Just before the entrance to Hyde Park Corner station. a small cafe is to be found. This is a very historical building as it used to be the toll house for road-users entering the city in years gone by.||February 8, 2016

traveldiaries89||50||I was in Hyde park in winter and it was stunning. The park is huge and was a nice walk for a couple of hours. There are friendly squirrels that come right up to you. The scenery is very green and tranquil. Lots of nice birds and people walking there dogs. We also walked to Kensington Palace which was really nice. ||February 7, 2016
David T||50||I divide Hyde Park into two halves, and walk one half each day. Green grass in the winter, but no leaves, and in summer everything is full. Speaker's Corner on a Sunday is always worth a visit to see which crazies have crawled out of their holes. Really a nice place to walk and see the swans and ducks in The Serpentine.||February 7, 2016
Leedsaway67||40||Enjoyed a really nice stroll to walk of my breakfast on a bright Sunday morning. The wind didn't spoil our enjoyment.||February 7, 2016
Cr569101||40||We walked from end of the park to the other. The Princess Diana memorial fountain (which is not a "fountain" by any means) is worth inspection. Families can picnic, walk their dogs, rent a boat, see the gardens. A lovely place away from the city but within the city.||February 7, 2016

You could easily spend a full day in Hyde Park if a nice day.. ||February 7, 2016

MegJrUSA||40||we love walking around, we love nature. We saw families, dogs, ducks, geese, water lol and lots of grass and trees.seriously though it was really nice to walk around and just enjoy the beauty of the park itself. there isn't per say things to do, unless you have a bike or dog to play with but for us just walking through it was way worth it.||February 6, 2016
jikoku||40||Beautiful open parklands butting up to Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace. We cut through on a windy February day and there were only a couple of dozen people in the whole park. Would make an ideal lunchtime picnic area, but not on a windy February afternoon.||February 6, 2016

katesD2701JQ||50||Although we went during the winter there was plenty to see in the park. One end Kensington Palace must be fantastic in the summer, even in winter there was some flowers out.

melodyg308||50||It is one of the greatest city parks i have ever seen. It is a large park with a large lake, a meadow and flower gardens. Actually, it is a park that has something for everyone.

jennifer_noble||50||Love to stay on the fringes of Hyde Park at all times of the year and then walk or jog the park for exercise to stay out of the hotel gym! So many things to see and a large parcel to be able to get in a great workout while enjoying the sites. Last time I was there, Prince William was jogging (with his detail).||February 2, 2016
Featherby87||50||We got engaged a short distance from here and afterwards had a lovely walk through, it was a beautiful day and will always hold special memories for us. Lovely park we have since revisited with our children and never fails to disappoint with nature and picturesque views. ||February 2, 2016
TERRAvelista||50||I used to live right near the place and walked it numerous times from east to west or north to south, so I know it inside out.I tend to avoid it when the weather is warm as it becomes a pest of negative multiculturalism - however there are some good area as you walk from Marble Arch towards Hight street Ken where you can hide and read a book undisturbed.There are great areas for riding your bike, pity that tourists do no seem to respect the lines and are more interested in shouting and behaving badly.You can also feed the squirrels near Lancaster Gate and see some cockatiels as you walk from here towards the Serpentine.On the streets nearby you can fix your time at night as some naughty foxes pass the same streets regularly - clever lasses!!!!||February 2, 2016
gaplifegirl||40||Lots of lovely walks although surrounded by dog walkers! a breath of fresh air in the city good walking routes to get around. great for children as well||February 2, 2016

TayGK||50||Surrounded on all sides by other attractions Hyde Park is a green wonderland in a rather beige bustling city!Honestly it's fantastic for a wander through at any time, in the summer grab yourself an ice cream and watch the ducks, geese and swans.

Eriveva||50||The park is a big breath of fresh air, when walking through it it gave us the sensation of being in the middle of the woods. There are lots of activities or just to sit down and take it all in. A must!||January 30, 2016

Breda2010||50||On a Sunday morning, joggers, dog walkers and families out for a stroll are all around. So many ducks, geese and swans on the lake but the most fascinating I thought were the green parrots which are now living quite happily in the park. A lovely large expanse of space right in the middle of London. Will always return here when visiting the capital.||January 29, 2016
USCKaboom||40||Lovely park that is always worth a visit. Some restaurants like Dinner by Heston Blumenthal have views of the park. On a nice day it's great to spend time strolling through the park. ||January 29, 2016
Brian B||50||On a beautiful sunny morning had brunch at the eatery alongside the Serpentine; excellent location and food at reasonable price for the very centre of London!||January 29, 2016

HellyWelly93||40||Enjoyed a sandwich here. Plenty of seating and pretty scenery to look at. Worth a visit and a walk around.||January 28, 2016
Cocciolino2015||50||The Park itself is lovely and wonderful in which just to walk around but what we really liked were the drawings and paintings hung outside on the railings on Sundays. We brought back a small,almost impressionist,painting of the Queen's Guards which,now framed,hangs in our studio and rarely passes unobserved.||January 28, 2016
the_Devilyn||50||The park is lovely in all seasons - it's always nice to walk through to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a while. My favourite part is the walk from Knightsbridge past the Albert Memorial to Kensington Palace.||January 27, 2016
Impulsivemiss||30||I spent a few hours walking here. Nothing special, only lots of trees and grass. Kings Park in Perth Western Australia is so much nicer.||January 27, 2016
naziakhaliq||50||I personally really like Hyde park, it's a quite and relaxing place recently I have started running in this park and it has a lot to explore. I feel this is the heart and the soul of London. You can easily run into Kensington Gardens.||January 27, 2016
Stan J||50||Happened by Hyde Park after visiting Harrods. Watched a woman feed squirrels from her hand and the pond had tons of birds. Take bread to feed the birds.||January 26, 2016

Philomena M||40||Passed our time here on the Sunday morning after a walk through the Park. Stalls were nice to browse through.||January 25, 2016
YTWsisters||50||I personally really like Hyde park, it's a quite and relaxing place but there are too many must-visit places in London. It may take you hours to only explore part of the park. For travellers who visit London for the first time, you can put it in your list for your next trip to London in the future. Remember to have a map with you before entering the park.||January 25, 2016
IntrepidTraveller06||50||Where would London be without Hyde Park?....well other than one park short...in my eyes it would be missing the best one...the heart and soul of London' parks.Hyde Park holds so many precious memories and is an integral part of the city. A must for all visitors and a secret pleasure for all Londoners who need a hit of green in the heart of the city.||January 25, 2016
Mike1331_13||50||The park is so large that you could spend a whole day strolling around looking at the various points of interest. These range from Marble Arch and Speakers Corner, Kensington House, the Serpintine and many formal and informal gardens, lakes and fountains. There are footpaths, cycle tracks and bridal ways crossing the park as well as food and drink outlets around the park.||January 25, 2016
Jess P||50||So easy to get to as it is central. We hired some of the bikes to ride around the park - it was so easy to do and so much fun. Lots to look at. would recommend for families, couples and friends. ||January 24, 2016

HaimDorinPrivado||40||Hyde Park, Just walk in the Center of London ! Nice park for spend all day just walking, seeing and enjoying the nature, views and even the nice weather if you have that ...||January 24, 2016
bdon257||50||We walked along the park at dusk and even then it has a beauty despite the very busy traffic on all sides, it is an oasis of calm in this huge metropolis. A lovely place to walk and relax. Apsley House and the Wellington Monument are Hyde Park attractions in their own right.||January 24, 2016
TiaSaid||40||We went at night to visit the winter wonderland - the christmas fair! the whole place was so lively and pretty but be aware SUPER COLD in December!||January 24, 2016
Andyt2120||50||Only visited London for a weekend but had two good walks through the park. Very well kept and full of wildlife. At one point I had squirrels and ring necked parakeets queuing up to be fed from my hand.Saw the Diana fountain and had a reasonably priced drink at the Lido Cafe. Great large park, well worth a visit.||January 24, 2016
jenny W||40||It was so nice to walk around hyde park and get away from the city. Once in the park you forgot all about the goings on of the busy city. Deferentially worth a look||January 24, 2016
beachlover6928||40||This park is full of birds and squirrels and trails along the waterway and the gardens is very peaceful. It is adjacent to Kensington gardens and the palace and it is nice to see all the locals with their dogs enjoying the park as well.||January 23, 2016
BubbersLongview_||50||When in London, we walked and walked... through Hyde Park. It was cold and wet and windy.. but it was fabulous for us. We collected small stones that a King might have turned over in his youth, or not. We watched the people and the birds on the lake. We asked directions and were always kindly answered. Then, we walked to the Kensington Castle for the tour of the Royal clothing. Another day in Londontown.||January 23, 2016
nmcmcm||50||Hyde Park is absolutely stunning and free to visist. I love coming here for a long walk or a picnic in the Summer. Would highly recommend a visit.||January 23, 2016

Phu C||30||We visited during Christmas when the Winter Wonderland was taking place in the park, which was the only reason to come here. Otherwise, this is merely another public space, one that isn't meticulously manicured either. If you're looking for some peace and quite, then drop by, but if you're in search for amazing flora and lush gardens, don't bother. Yes, we visited in the winter, but there weren't any signs of greenery that will blossom in the spring either. On the west end is Kensington Palace, so you'll likely have to pass through it to get there.To arrive at the park, the nearest metro (tube) station is Hyde Park Corner on the blue line. If you plan on using public transportation more than twice per day, buy an Oyster Card (not a Visitor Oyster Card) for 5 pounds, then add 6.40 pounds per day since this is the daily cap for unlimited public transit use in Zones 1-2 (these zones encompass almost all tourist sights like Big Ben, Buckingham, Kensington, London Eye, etc). The 5 pound deposit is refundable if you go to a counter at any tube station before returning home (otherwise you'll have to request a refund by mail).||January 22, 2016
Carlos M||50||A stroll through Hyde Park (and other large parks in London, which has several) is relaxing, interesting and comforting. British parks have a natural feel to them, which I appreciate. They are very well kept but do not project a manicured feel. You will enjoy them. ||January 22, 2016
Manisha G||50||This place is nice for having a long walk with the loved ones. very relaxing and very beautiful. Must visit||January 22, 2016
Angelvicky365||50||get your walking boots on (or cycling helmet!) great scenery, ideal for ramblers, has a couple cafes and gift shops dotted around. Recommend hiring a bike for the day at affordable prices and cycle around.||January 22, 2016
Catarina A||50||Working in Knightsbridge it's amazing, especially when you have such an amazing park like this one right next to you. For me it's the best place to run in entire London. From the serpentine to Diana's playground and another's places it's just an amazing place to go and freed your mind.||January 21, 2016
Emcintaggart||50||Such a gorgeous place. Although tends to get very busy in the Summer time, with lots of people having picnics on the grass. Definitely worth going for a run through and just a long walk. Sometimes seeing grass and trees in London is refreshing (literally!)||January 21, 2016
Curt H||50||Take a break from you day of travel and relax amongst the tranquil atmosphere of Hyde Park. Refresh yourself with Mother Nature and forget about father time! ||January 21, 2016
Moza84||30||Hyde Park is nice place if you want to have a walk and relax, no special activities, cafes or any thing else. I wouldn't recommended for people who will have a short stay on London,there is so better things to do.||January 21, 2016
Pestoshrek||50||Loved the long walk. I was extremely underwhelmed by the area dedicated for Diana, Princess of Wales. Hmm... That's it? It looked like some random fountain. I'm glad it didn't require any entrance fees, or I would've gone bonkers.||January 21, 2016
Amylou2611||50||The winter wonderland was just incredible. The atmosphere was full of fun. The markets and food was just to die for :)||January 21, 2016

Amazing in summer and winter just wrap up warm . You can have lovely tea and cake and watch the ducks and birds . Amazing place . ||January 20, 2016
601RyanG||50||The best place to be in London is still the Hyde Park. An old classic where everyone goes and which does reflect the beauty of this city in the best way! Especially best to visit during Sunset!||January 19, 2016
Bgd1973||50||As we live next to Hyde park we are often there, great for running, walks, art gallery, picnics, cafes and bars. The Italian founds and Albert memorial are stunning. London residents and visitors are lucky to have this on our doorstep. ||January 19, 2016
Mdsaki||40||Took family after many years, had a wonderful time walking and kids running around brings back memories. I would advise anyone to go there to relax ||January 19, 2016
LusiaSL||50||If you're looking for a place where you can enjoy the nature, sit on a bench and relax or jog a bit, Hyde Park is your choice. Another thing I loved about it is that the Harrods is only a couple of blocks away;)||January 19, 2016
LanaThomas75||50||Great walking park, for all - walking, running, cycling, playing. Fabulous toilets for public use at 20p ! A park for all to see, statue etc ||January 19, 2016
Ruben R||50||Hyde park is massive. If you are a runner freak, this is the place to go in London and get off everything. If you want a regular walk, admire the trees, birds, some squirrels, go no further. It is so big that you can go to just a part of it and will be more than enough. If you made it to see it all, I am sure you will want one in your hometown.||January 18, 2016
Nam1610||50||Hyde Park is a must go in case you are in London - Kensington. The park be it in Summer or Winter is as beautiful and captivating as anyone can imagine...so serene and peaceful. Really re-energises you to the core!!||January 18, 2016
V H||40||Beautiful open space in the middle of London. Dotted with historical homes and lodges. Went for a run around the park (5-6 miles). There are lots of people around bikers, walkers, runner and even a couple riding their horses.||January 18, 2016
Flower53_10||50||The Hyde Park is one of the best places in London and there are several reasons for that: fresh air in the middle of the city, place to relax, sightseeing ( in case it's your first time here) , eat or have coffee, meeting friends, playing with kids, walking the dogs, or just crossing it in order to get to your target.The Hyde Park is surrounded by most of the major areas in London: Marble arch, Mayfair, Belgravia, Knightsbridge, South Kensington, Bayswater, Lancaster Gate. Therefore it's easy to get there . There are plenty of attractions , to name few: Pricess Diana's Memorial, Serpintine , Italian Gardens, Kengsington Palace and gardens , Speakes' Corner , etc. There are cafes and restaurants too.So, don't forget to visit this diamond of London. ||January 18, 2016
Rebeccagx||30||The scenery was amazing but for a person with anxiety/panic attacks it wasn't controlled by the security well because they didn't search people's bags which didn't make an anxious person feel better. Otherwise the market was amazing with great stalls and amazing food. ||January 17, 2016
ronin308||40||To be fair I could only spend a brief amount of time here and it was raining/threatening to rain. They had a Christmas carnival setup with rides and such, it looked like fun. Down by the lake restaurant there were these enormous swans and ducks begging for food. From there it was a quick and easy walk down to Victoria station. ||January 17, 2016
Marieluise_Maiwald||40||Hyde Park is where the locals get their exercise. On a Sunday in July it is more packed then Oxford Street. Bring your Skates or borrow a 'Boris Bike' (the City-Bike Scheme funded by Barclays and Santander). Alternatively you can rent a rowing boat and have strawberries and Champagne onboard!||January 17, 2016
Evelyn A||50||First visit here, loved it, lots of people jogging, walking, walking dogs, feeding birds, ducks, swans, Saw the Diana fountain, Italian gardens, and more, ||January 17, 2016

true30||50||Love this park. Very vast with plenty of things to see and do. There is a swimming area which looks great! A massive pond. Princess Diana gardens great for kids. A few places to get food/drinks/ice creams. Lots of different ways to walk around and also great for a bike ride ||January 17, 2016
ninav582||50||Hyde park is a must-visit place if you're visiting London. You can either rest on the grass or go for a run, ride a bike (you can rent one on the entrance) or listen to the speakers in the Speakers' corner (nothing special, mostly religious fanatics, but it is an experience you shouldn't miss).||January 17, 2016
makesholiday||50||Hyde Park is an interesting place in central London. It offers many things to see from formal statuary to a surprising amount of wild life, mainly avian. I saw my first Ring Necked Parakeets here today, just three very noisy birds but that was worth the brief walk whilst we were waiting for our transport to arrive.If you are a rider there are many official cycle tracks that also interconnect with many other London tracks. We were there in Winter so it certainly was not a place to linger but in the Spring and Summer it is a wonderful place to sit and relax.||January 17, 2016
Manxman1957||50||Even in the middle of a very cold January, the Park is a great place to get away from the bustle of the city. Diana Memorial is well worth a visit. Also a great place for People watching the London weirdo's (sorry, the rich and famous!)||January 16, 2016
Shula1||40||We walked around eating crisps. Too bad we didn't bring a blanket and food for some impromptu picnic. ||January 15, 2016
Zinia R||50||We loved getting away from busy roads and meandering around this huge park. Could have spent several days visiting. We don't have squirrels in NZ so my kids enjoyed interacting with them. ||January 15, 2016

Kate P||40||Hyde Park is HUGE, so if you want to walk its length, be aware that you're going to walk a lot. But it's a really lovely place to take a walk or picnic!||January 15, 2016
Ye Y||40||We spent a relaxing afternoon with friends in Hyde Park. We sat on the grass in front of the lake, where the swan and ducks enjoy themselves, so did we. It was not a planned trip to Hyde Park for us, but if you go with your families, remember to bring the picnic sheet and sun protections for kids. Spending a joyful afternoon chatting, walking and playing at Hyde Park is a very good choice in the summer. Most importantly, it is totally free!!!Loved it!||January 15, 2016
Duane F||40||Great to just get away from the hustle and bustle of shopping, nice to sit outside at the cafe by the lake, though everyone thought we where mad as it was freezing, obviously a northern thing?||January 15, 2016
882tanyam||50||We rode cycles through here, walked through. Loved the Lady Diana memorial, the water parks, gardens, baby squirrels and out door deck chairs. Something here in this park really for everyone, I loved it. ||January 14, 2016
Rickytrips1234||50||I took my wife to see Kyle here and we was not disappointed great views food and drink with lots of hotels near by and good transport links||January 14, 2016
Freddyminster||40||This park is iconic and is very large. I took a friend to see it and they were not disappointed. It is free, safe, and open all year. You can walk around, you can sit and people-watch, you can ride a bike. There are people skating, riding horses, jogging, there is something going on all the time. A perfect place for a picnic.||January 14, 2016
UmurXIV||50||Unlike other parks in London, Hyde Park is more touristic! Whenever I've been there, cafes were always full. But the lake inside has a great view with cute little ducks and swans swimming in it! There are also interesting attractions throughout the year such as festivals and Winter Wonderland.||January 14, 2016
David O||50||It was a bit cool, but the sun was out so we fed the ducks and squirrels, looked at the other birds, photographed the winter trees, and had a coffee at the restaurant on the lake, a thoroughly great day.||January 13, 2016
seremban||40||You simply MUST NOT RUSH.. walk slowly...enjoy the sight sounds and smells... i would rate it excellent if it werent becoz it's so huge, you cant walk very fast nor far on a hot day... the swans are the ever willing models... you can create such lovely pix with them at sunset... shoot the trees too. they are so artistic...||January 13, 2016
Marika K||50||As my hotel was very close to Hyde Park I walked here often while I stayed in London. I met a lot of friendly and kind local women who meet together to walk their dogs here in the mornings. the park is absolutely beautiful. It is also huge! I was also thrilled to see children riding their ponies on a horse track they have in the park. You can use the park as a thoroughfare between Paddington and the Royal Albert Hall and Harrods. The bird life is vibrant and there are lots of places in the park to explore.||January 13, 2016
Gailywaily2014||50||Beautiful, especially by the Serpentine Lake. A must in all seasons. The Italian Gardens near Lancaster Gate is one of the most romantic spots in Central London.||January 13, 2016
horsewildwolf||40||Great, safe and social London park. This really recommended park is brilliant for Londoners and visitor as well. Parking is always ok apart from when Winter Wonderland is on over Christmas. ||January 13, 2016
NoTourGuideNeeded||40||It is a great place to see people standing on the box. Look up the times. If not, you can just go an relax in this park. Do not pass it up. ||January 13, 2016
169deanl||40||I found Hyde Park a great place to sit down for a sandwich and reflect. During the summer you can swim in the lido which I recommend that you do at least once. I have done many races in the serpentine and the water is fine. A great way to cool down on a summer afternoon.||January 13, 2016
joey_dmn||40||had a beautiful walk through this clean and scenic park, so much to enjoy and see just strolling through.you must go and have a walk!||January 12, 2016
Alex L||40||It's huge, you can relax and nobody comes to bug you (most of the time), it is a great place in London.||January 12, 2016
Lacaltex||50||We enjoyed walking through this park a few times. There were lots of beautiful emerald colored parakeets in this park. When we first saw them, we thought they belonged to someone but then realized that if you put some seeds in your hands, they fly over and sit on your hand to eat them.||January 12, 2016
Rob F||50||Winter Wonderland is a gigantic carnival/fair inside Hyde Park during the holidays. We went the day after Boxing Day with thousands of visitors and had a blast. Kiosks, shops, concessions and rides of all kinds made for and exciting night of fun. Handicap accessible and spread out over a large area allowed crowds to move freely. The park is very large and easy to walk. Suggest attending Speakers Corner events or listening to street musicians or walking along the large lake. Take your time and enjoy this park which has Kensington Palace at the western end and Buckingham Palace at the Eastern end. ||January 12, 2016
TPF53||40||Went here on the hottest day of the year for a picnic supper. Some small supermarkets on Knightsbridge Road for food and cold drinks. Quite crowded (although eventually found a seat) until dark but good for people watching. Only spoiled by idiot cyclists who think they can ride anywhere including straight into crowds of people.||January 12, 2016
Becky-0052||40||A lovely walk in the park for anyone to enjoy. Free entertainment for children if you take a loaf of bread to the pond to feed the ducks and swans, if not take along a football or scooter.||January 12, 2016
Mistry86||40||this is a nice park and good to go in summer.watch out as events can be planned here so can be very busy at times- so check ahead.great for a picnic or family day out.||January 12, 2016

Catarina I||50||If you love nature, you will love this. For a picnic. For reading a book. For running. For cycling. For an afternoon with friends. For whatever if feel like doing outside. You will not regret spending some hours in this place!||January 11, 2016
Diana P||50||I live right next to Hyde Park and so I come here almost on a daily basis when I am in London. The Serpentine is my favourite part of it all. I also enjoy biking around Hyde Park as it is very calm and relaxed, ||January 11, 2016
JeffCD261||50||What a great thing to attend. Whomever puts this together got real serious. The entire walking area was temporarily paved so that it wasn't muddy or sketchy but well drained and clean. The rides are scary big and not your garden variety carnival rides. The shopping food and amusements were all terrific. Plenty of fire pits, warming huts, and live entertainment. Clean and abundant toilets. Pretty much everything you need to have a good time safely. The food and beverage variety was vast and very good.||January 11, 2016
Rebecca O||50||I just love this park. Place to walk, to see, to have fun, to swim and even eat on the restaurant overlooking the lake if you wish. Horse riding, swan feeding, boating and many many more. Even concert are held here. So i have to say it is really my favorite park in London||January 11, 2016

Diane M||40||All the points of interest were in Hyde Park availasble to a stroll. However, the rides, games, and attractions for the winter funfest were a bit off putting.||January 10, 2016
Alexandragfkelly||40||Great for long strolls around a park. There are normally activities to do all year round as well for all ages. There are bus tours as well so you can see some of the many jewels around the park. This is the equivalent to Central park in NYC.||January 10, 2016
Evieee14||40||Expensive day out but worth it.Bar ice jackets absolutely stunk needed a good wash.£5-£10 for a ride per persongood cheap food.||January 10, 2016

chrrchr||50||Had a very lovely walk in the park on a sunny winter. We saw ducks and geese swimming in the lake, birds flying around, squirrel scurrying around the trees, people running with their dogs or playing with them and lots of people just strolling about. The sun was shining and the breeze was so cooling. One of the highlights of our tour to London. Too bad I forgot to bring bread to feed them||January 9, 2016
Richard T||40||Nice walk in the park with a light mist falling. The air felt clean and smelled fresh. Strolling through the tree lined walkway was a vast departure from the busy streets and sidewalks littered with trash that rimmed the park!||January 9, 2016
167jeffk||50||A lovely place to get lost and not believe you could possibly be even near a world class city. You can spend a day walking and still not see it all. Great for exercise or relaxation. A must see in London.||January 9, 2016
PaphitanisK||50||From our hotel it was the perfect place for a quick run in the morning, next to squirrel ducks and swans.||January 9, 2016
Edward C||50||My first time to hyde park and I really full in love with this degree amazing lovely area. there is the a few walnut trees and it will may be be the only place in the uk has it!!! it will be nice for everybody to visit this exquisite hyde park......||January 9, 2016
jbsilverhill||50||Thought hyde park was beautiful. Saw my first squirrel ever there. Lovely to walk around and enjo all the gardens and sculptures that were there. Definitely recommend a visit.||January 8, 2016
activetrekker||50||This park is quite cute, and has lots of birds. Did I mention there are a lot of birds here? Well there are, and all different species of birds too. Watch out for people feeding birds, as they will flock to the food like crazy.||January 8, 2016
rich_rg||50||It is a beautiful park. Ideal to take a relaxed walk with friends and family. If you want to do a little exercise it is also excellent for jogging||January 8, 2016
glissade2||50||I stayed a short walk from Hyde Park and roamed it every day of my week-long trip. So much to explore! Fun to find the parakeets who will eat out of your hand. Love the "energy" sculpture at the center. It does get crowded, but not hard to walk. I also took a horse ride through the bridle paths. Not "paths" by my New England standards- more like a two-lane road. Really gorgeous! ||January 8, 2016
operama2015||40||Enjoyed our recent trip to Winter Wonderland in Hyde park. Despite the rain we enjoyed the Christmas market and we got under cover in the Bavarian Village to enjoy a hot drink. Didn't much care for the fair ground rides but could be what families are looking for.Best part was the Magical Ice Kingdom. We booked our tickets online to make sure of a place but it was not over busy. We loved the beautiful ice sculptures.||January 8, 2016
NathanHun||50||A beautiful and huge park with the famous Speakers' Corner. Worth a visit if you're in London. -----||January 8, 2016
sc0tty1990||50||i love jiust walking around parks this is flat and perfect to walk around without having to hold the childrens hand all the time. PEACEFULL||January 8, 2016
MS1900||50||lovely for a stroll, lovely for a break in the middle of a busy day - hyde park is an oasis in a busy world.||January 8, 2016
Rury_Glasgow||50||I always enjoy a walk around Hyde park on trips to London so much to do weather you hire a boat on the serpentine or hire a boris bike for a cycle even just a stroll in the park it's great place for all weather your travelling with friend or family. The stunning Kensington Palace is at the western end of the park which you can visit or in the summer I find it a great place just to relax have a picnic and enjoy the Great British Summer.||January 8, 2016
40aleshas||50||Visited this park with family and my boys 3 and 5 did not want to leave. Heaps of room to run and go wild. Loved the ducks and geese at the pond. Feed lorikeets and squirrels. Kids did not want to do anything else in London. ||January 7, 2016
mayfair74||50||Magical!, great for walking riding horses bikes History Arboriculture , cafes I wish I could sleep there! The Serpentine is great. the central location makes it easy to find a. Sweet spot to get away from the frenetic pace that is up town . In the heart of London an Oasis.||January 7, 2016
Craig S||50||One of the greatest, if not the greatest park in the world. Ran every morning in the park and on most days spent time walking across the park as well. So many sites, so clean and peaceful.||January 7, 2016
tanafluk||30||As somebody who doesn't overly enjoy strolling around in nature, this park didn't do much to endear itself to me. Don't get me wrong, in general I like parks and I've been in some really pretty ones, but as parks go, Hyde Park is average. It's big, it's pretty, it's a nice opportunity to take a break, a picnic or a relaxing walk if you're into that sort of thing.||January 7, 2016
geonapa||50||A beautifull park to do your jogging in the morning hours around the lake. There is also a confined place in the lake for the dare to swim there.||January 7, 2016
Bec_Troy||50||We stopped by Kensington Palace and Hyde Park on our 3 day stop in London. We spent a couple of hours just walking around beautiful Hyde Park, enjoying seeing all the dogs out for a run and also spotted lots of squirrels running around, and birds on the lakes. It was so green and leafy and beautiful and despite being very busy, still so peaceful.Although a little chilly when we were there, it was still gorgeous. We had a little trouble finding the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain but were so pleased we kept looking until we did - not sure what I was expecting, but its understated beauty and simplicity and the serenity there was perfect.Very glad we made the effort to take some time out in Hyde Park, we loved it!||January 6, 2016
Simon10077||50||Perfect for a romantic walk or a walk with kids. Lots of lovely wildlife to see and places to just sit down and relax on a nice sunny day. ||January 6, 2016
tmentzer||40||If you live in London, Hyde Park is great. Beautiful green expanse in the middle of the city, nice places to walk. Delightful. If you're visiting, not worth the time. It's a big park. Princess Diana Fountain is underwhelming. Speakers Corner is amusing for a few minutes. Recommend skipping the park and hitting the Victoria & Albert instead. Much better use of your time.||January 6, 2016
cobilly||40||I have always had a fascination with big parks, like the Tiergarten and Central Park. I only wish the weather was warmer, and the trees were in leaf...I guess I will have to come in June instead of January. Absolutely lovely, just the same with lots of paths, places to sit and ponder or have picnics.||January 6, 2016
harvestnowacct||50||With London the first stop on our Europe trip, on reflection Hyde Park was magnificent even in the depth of winter.When considering the tight crowded laneways so typical of the Europe we have seen, Hyde Park is a Jewel of London.Whilst we were there our teenagers could experience Winter Wonderland along with hundred of thousands of others, yet so much of Hyde Park remaind the peoples park. The ability to have that as a significant part of a morning walk was excellent at the time but now can be seen as even better, probably in the top three places this Aussie saw and felt in Europe.Definitely a Jewell! ||January 6, 2016
Angelika A||50||It was very pretty but a lot of people! My daughter enjoyed a few rides and we went skating on the ice-rink!||January 6, 2016
Steve C||50||as this place is beautiful there is a lot of people to visit here everyday! it is just amazing! I went to date a nice girl here and I had a good time here. I will go and visit again if I find a date! if you ever travel here please bring your camera too. highly recommended!||January 6, 2016
sks_1992||50||My boyfriend and I had a lovely stroll round Hyde park, saw prince Diana water feature. Also I got attacked by the 'friendly' squirrels, they thought we had food lol. It was funny but scary hahaha. But we went in December so it wasn't great weather but we said we'd do it again in summer and enjoy a meal at the restaurant next to the lake ||January 5, 2016
Sara E||50||This park is stunning all year round. I come here all the time for walks and to see what's going on. There is always some sort of attraction going on. For example, they have Winter Wonderland set up every year in December and it is a must see if you are in London during that time of year. I could go on and on about Hyde Park. There are all sorts of interesting things to do and see. For example, there's the Peter Pan sculpture here and even a pet cemetery hidden here (visitor's can't access). ||January 5, 2016
EliseFareza||50||I love green and Hyde park it's the best place for walk and sight seeing. I did morning run everyday during the winter and I love it. The park seems like very big to explore but with nice coffee and the environment you just fall in love to come everyday. ||January 5, 2016
Stanley W||40||We went to Hyde park on 26 Dec after our tiring boxing day spree. As it was our first time, we expected a normal event site. But lo behold, alot of fun fair activities, rides and food!!!!! a great place to go for winter wonderland if you have no where else to go to spend time, money and stomach space hahah||January 5, 2016
gigigamble||50||One of my favourite places in London. To walk and enjoy the gardens, the pond and just people watching was fun. A place that I have read about and seen in many shows. Something crossed off my bucket list. ||January 5, 2016
montheruk||50||If you visit London you have to visit hyde park more than one time. Bring camera and share your photos with friends and family you love ||January 5, 2016
shezzgog||40||Excellent, stalls and entertainment, funfair, rides, food and entertainment for all ages. The funfair area is extremely noisy, but the rest is fine. You will need plenty of money because there are so many things you will want to buy and try.||January 5, 2016
JasmineLouise||50||Definitely somewhere worth going for a walk. Go and hire a rowing boat in the summer or a pair of roller blades from the shop in marble arch and cruise along the river. Lots of sports played there over the weekend too which is always a good watch. ||January 5, 2016
Richard W U||50||A tranquil retreat, a utopia and a Xanadu in the Heart of London. What a beautiful and expansive park. Hearing my grandmother talk of the days when ladies used to try and outdo each other with the styles and fashions of their hats in Hyde Park, I tried to picture what it must have been like 75+ years ago. I experienced this park on a sunny day and entered it after hopping off the tube at Hyde Park Corner. Do go and pay it a visit. The swans and ducks on the Serpentine are always very friendly... well, for the most part!||January 5, 2016
sunnyhpsurani||50||I don't know why, but each time I visit the Hyde park i feel very happy and it gives me peace of mind, I love spending time out there especially in summer.||January 5, 2016
Jen D||50||I could go to Hyde park every day. So nice to just be able to walk from my brother's flat and wander through the park. ||January 5, 2016
Diari S||50||Now that park is the best park probably in the world as I've travelled a lot ! It's really nice for a morning workout and if you plan on traveling to London then you should go in winter as the "winter wonderland" opens up where you can spend quality time your friends or family ! The best amusement park and the fun factor is 10/10 stars ! It has games for every age as extreme attractions are available for teens and people that like adrenaline boost kicks or just restaurants to enjoy a hot meal ! 10/10 for sure ! Amazing park ||January 5, 2016
Sara E||50||Great space to walk, nice to have a lovely green space in the city to escape to. Great for sitting and people watching on a summer day with a picnic.We have also visited Hyde Park at night when there has been a concert on and it is equally as good and very well managed.Definitely recommend ||January 5, 2016
XFF40||50||Beautiful at any time of year, but especially fun during the "Winter Wonderland" at Christmas time. Touristy, yes, but such a fun Christmas-y atmosphere.||January 5, 2016
Victoria D||50||I love walking in Hyde Park garden as it is very quiet and beautiful in the center of London. I enjoy the lake and all the birds||January 5, 2016
beatriz f||50||nice park in London. Great location and beautiful. There is a lake where you can see goose and ducks.||January 5, 2016
4n6geekette||40||A lovely park and a great place to wander or take a sack lunch. But don't miss the Winter Wonderland carnival / fair. Food, rides, ice skating, vendors, ice sculptures. My family had a great time. ||January 5, 2016
Daniel D||30||Well to be honest I expected more out of this park. Maybe it was because of the weather but I guess the hype around the park is bigger. It's okay, well it's a huge park in the middle of a huge city but it's really not all that special. Maybe I'd see it differently in the summer.||January 4, 2016
Anna_Bez||50||Amazinggggggg park for walk !!!! Definetly somewhere that u should go and have a walk !!! I would recommend this park to everyone !!! It is in the town and the only thing that u can see is green !!! Lovely place for visitor if they want to have a walk and relax||January 4, 2016
anita h||40||It's always nice to see nature when you are bored with the city. So when you are in London and feel it's time to relax, you definitely should go to Hyde Park! It was very beautiful when I went there. It was autumn, the leaves were colourful and I can see everyone there were so relax, enjoying their time. You can feed the animal there that is living in the lake. Oh yes, there is a huge beautiful lake which you shouldn't miss!||January 4, 2016
janellemariee||50||A lovely place to walk around and experience a mix of yesterday and today. The winter wonderland event may not be up to everyone's standards, but it was fun.||January 4, 2016
59elysep||50||Just walking through Hyde Park allows you to soak up the essence of a British day. The fresh air, the beautiful Serpentine and the flora and fauna that surrounds it are great. The cycle routes that weave throughout and the hidden cafes and areas of interest are really special. The park is loved and this is o so apparent from the truly kept nature of the green space. Hyde park makes London the fantastic city that it is, as there are few if any large metropolises with such an escape in the middle. Further more you only need to stray a few hundred metres out of each direction to be on the Mall, or be at the Museums or do some shopping on Oxford street.||January 4, 2016
Tatyana G||50||we stay near park, and i enjoy every day ! very english, very green, very big! and clean what s important!perfect for a city like london. i really loved it! either with children, or adults it is perfect for a nice walk!||January 4, 2016
Misty64_13||50||Went to Hyde park it's a lovely park for a nice walk, visited princess Diane fountain didn't know what to expect think they've done a good job. Also visited winter wonderful whic was full of family things to do.||January 4, 2016
1HolidayExpert1||50||Lovely when all the wildlife are out, you can get close to the squirrels and if you're lucky even feed them some nuts. They're so used to the people! I like the way that its a central location in the City although you can still relax. Definitely worth going when in the area, even just to walk through.||January 4, 2016
FarhaA88||50||We vistied Hyde Park for the winter wonderland, they really have done an amazing job with this. The grass is fully covered so your not walking on wet grass. The fun fair is fun for the whole family. ||January 4, 2016
Beata K||50||Hyde park is wonderful especially in Winter when the Winter Wonderland there. It is a nice day out programm.||January 4, 2016
Bookem1||50||Hyde Park is a great place to take stock. You can sit on the grass or on benches, or drift around on the abundant and inexpensive bicycles.||January 3, 2016
Trip_Action||50||A large park with the famous 'Speakers Corner' which welcomes debate on many areas of society although it is predominately focused on religion. This can cause a lot of anomosity amongst spectators and I have seen several funny looking characters at the speakers corner.The park is very busy and for dog walking ideal although mostly on the lead as many public members do not appreciate a dog under no control.I hate this aspect of the park ... when is a dog supposed to roam free then!!Early morning the joggers are out and parking is available metered and their is also an underground NCP car park.Opposite sits The Dorchester Hotel which is a great venue for afternoon coffee ( beware of prices) also Not dog friendly||January 3, 2016
TheMarritts||50||love visiting Hyde park, always lots to do and lots going on. Make sure you take bread for the ducks and swans and ensure you find a WC before you go as its a bit of a walk to the nearest on. ||January 3, 2016
Craig40-1975||50||What a brilliant brilliant experience. Everything that it lives up to and the title matches the experience. So well done and something within for everyone. Ice Bar experience was excellent. ||January 3, 2016
Mike B||50||Using Hyde Park mostly for exercise, early morning and late evening running, but occasionally also for relaxed walk. No matter of season or weather condition, you will enjoy Hyde Park. From feeding ducks or squirrels, seeing swans, to see guards on the horses, to view of nice garden or palace and high buildings outside the park. During Xmas time you can also see winter wonderland, but be honest this one I do not recommend at all. Nothing to do with Xmas spirit, it is literally commercial mess.||January 2, 2016
Orlaith D||30||The Winter Wonderland was a lovely way to spend the evening. The carousel bar was fantastic. Very reasonable prices also. I would recommend taking a trip here during the winter in London. ||January 2, 2016
342charlottec||40||What better way to just get out and burn of energy, wrap up take a picnic and bring the scooters. Very clean well maintained park. Beautiful in the summer and winter. We always find something either going on here or find something to keep the kids occupied.Parking nearby.Pram & wheelchair friendly ||January 2, 2016
monimru||50||I love hyde park. in the middle of a hectic city a beautiful park, which offers you not only a green feast to your eyes but also many places where you can chill and relax.||January 2, 2016
antonellas915||40||My suggestion is to start from Saint James's Park and go through Green Park, and enter in Hyde Park from the main gate, go along the serpentine and reach on the other side the Kensington Gardens... take a full spring day with sparkly sun and that's it.||January 2, 2016
Jo-AnnKYTan||50||There was a fun fair and Christmas stalls when i was there. Security was good. Good atmosphere and lovely to walk around. I even went up on a roller coaster ride! Had a good ole hotdog n coffee before I left. The crowd was non stop but it was not super packed. Great evening. ||January 2, 2016
sunilnjain||50||Huge open space and is also good for boating. Very near to Hyde Park tube station.If you are in London this place is a must visit during sunny day.||January 1, 2016
charmedc||50||always great to visit this park. Its never boring and the kids enjoy it a lot. Winter wonderland being there this time of year is great.||January 1, 2016
mere13||50||There are few such serene places in the midst of such a big city as Hyde Park. I always enjoy a stroll through this city park whenever I find myself in good old London town. The green space is astounding in such an old and storied city. Definitely recommend a visit here.||January 1, 2016
spooj||40||Hyde park is a huge park.. Beautiful indeed... One should wear comfortable footwear as long walks involved. It is well connected, underground station n bus stops are close||January 1, 2016
gretas2016||50||I was surprised about this hyde park winter wonderland, it was so beautiful, bright and cozy there are a lot of fun||January 1, 2016
Mayra_Kelly_Calixto||50||Near to Marble arch and the Queensway neighborhood, it is a great place to sit, relax and read a book :-) The are many attractions there including The Serpentine Gallery and a lot of lovely Squirrels to feed. One of the tube stations to reach it is the Hyde park Corner. Miss London!||January 1, 2016
Janelle Q||40||Our family attended the Winter Wonderland attraction in Hyde Park during our Christmas holiday vacation.We enjoyed the event but it seemed like we had to walk forever to get to the main entrance. Also, It rained the day before so the grounds were wet and it smelled a little (like wet zoo animals).Me children rode several rides and then we were ready to leave. The food--as normal--was severely overpriced. ||January 1, 2016
JSB80209||50||One of the world's best city parks - can walks for hours here if you want - have also enjoyed horseback riding in the park, but you do need to go a few days early for a reservation - stables are in the mews north of the park and not easy to find without looking them up and a good map prior. Huge Christmas market - rides and eateries. The lake is always a beautiful place to sit and enjoy - if the weather is good, nice to read or knit !||December 31, 2015
dismail2015||50||Perfect place to disconnectEvery time I'm in London I have to go. It's a must go that you shouldn't ever miss!Enjoy to the max ||December 31, 2015
DonaldMcCa||50||Went to Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park over December period and what a blast.They setup a fun fair with enjoyable rides and haunted houses for all ages and have plenty of bratwursts, roast chestnuts stands and a carousel bar for mulled wine and beers.Entrance is free, but rides are not. They raged from £3 - £8 that I could see.||December 31, 2015
ParagLathia||50||The park is right in center of London. It has a large patch of greenery which makes it a wonderful place to be during any time of the day||December 31, 2015
thetravelonthebrain||50||So, what's the deal with Hyde Park? It is the green heart of London like the Central Park is for NYC. It is a breath of fresh air after walking in the busy Oxford Street. And it is enormous. You won't find a little forest to get lost in (like in Central Park) but lots of green spaces with trees here and there that sometimes make you think you are no longer in the city, it is that big. There are ponds, lakes and beautiful Victorian buildings and statues. Highlights: The Fountain, Speakers Corner with an actual speaker and the Christmas market in DecemberDon't forget to also stroll through the attached Kensington Gardens and gaze up at the wonderful Albert Memorial.If you come with kids, you can feed the many ducks and spot the squirrels (try not to feed them).||December 31, 2015
andrea_lwy||30||when we went there my cousin took us to the winter wonderland... it was very fun and we got to enjoy the rides there.... there were a lots of food available so you can choose many food to eat||December 30, 2015
Adam D||50||I love Hyde Park - it's good reputation is deserved. It's a great place for both tourists and Londoners alike.||December 30, 2015
Aga S||40||Lovely Park but gets extremely crowded during summer times. If you are visiting for a first time, prepare map as it is quite easy to get disoriented and you don't want to miss main attractions.||December 30, 2015
Wendy W||40||As my husband and I (in our 50s) were visiting London thought we would take a look at the Winter Wonderland. We had heard that entrance was free but anything you chose to do in the park would be very expensive. Actually we just enjoyed the atmosphere. It was lively and fun. Lots of places to get good food and drink. A very festive atmosphere with singers. Even if you don't want to spend money on the rides it is fun just watching. Lots of stalls to buy small items - as after Christmas everything on sale and very nice. We went to the park about 5pm so dark and not manic. An hour and a half later unbelievably busy and we left. But we did enjoy wandering around and soaking up the fun atmosphere.||December 30, 2015
Dharmesh S||50||In the heart of London. This large patch of greenery is heaven. Ideal for running, long walks. They also have few eatery which are really good. Even though its busy during summer its a good place to visit in winter too. Does'nt matter if you are by your self, couple, friends or family. It is a 'must visit'.||December 30, 2015
rbtdxb||50||My favorite park in the world. Its huge, lots of greenery. Squirrels, birds, butterflies, swans and even parrots. A great place to unwind from the busy city. Great long walks too.||December 30, 2015
636stevef||40||Hyde Park is a typical central open space. Theres lots to see and do. Its a nice environment and worth a visit. Just watch the traffic, cars do drive fast through it||December 29, 2015
kalgran||50||Hyde Park is an extensive green oasis in the heart of London. When the crowds of Oxford Street get too much, this is a lovely place to slip away to. Although the park itself is always busy, it's big enough to find a quiet place for some respite. Have a wander along the Serpentine, look for Peter Pan's statue, feed the ducks and swans, stroll through to Kensington Gardens and admire the palace that Princess Diana made her home. You can make the experience whatever you wish. I always feel a visit to London is not quite complete without a Hyde Park ramble.||December 29, 2015
Becka01||50||Not so sure I would rush to visit again I'll be honest. It's absolutely crazy, there was just me and my boy and I'm glad we hadn't gone with more people as I think we would have lost them in the crowd. Some of the staff were lovely and helpful but some very curt and short with me when I asked where the ice palace and toilets were. Everything is extremely expensive but it is all very pretty. If it wasn't as busy I would consider returning although I wouldn't bother with the ice kingdom. ||December 29, 2015
annienwium1234||50||Such a lovely park to stroll in - can walk the whole day Nice restaurants and lovely picnic spots. a must in nice weather. ||December 29, 2015
157DavidM||40||I gather this fair and circus come here every year but it's my first visit. We had a great time and what was nice was not having to pay to enter. You do of course have to pay for the circus which was really very good. No animals involved so great even for animal rights activists too!!!! There are German market stalls, Bavarian beer stalls, pretzel stalls and lots of big rides. Bring the whole family! ||December 29, 2015
Davidcollinsheywood||50||I had a long walk around Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. It was relaxing and I did not feel I was "in a huge city".I watched the swimmers in the Serpentine and although it was a warm day [for December] I salute their courage!||December 29, 2015
shuhada154||40||Managed to book a hotel nearby Hyde Park, so we manage to walk at the park for few times, very nice park to have some time spend with your family and have some recreational activities. During winter theres also Winter Wonderland which is also the main attraction! We had so much fun doing so much activities there! ||December 28, 2015
PhilaAnne||50||We were lucky enough to be be here at end of December and the weather is great and we had a lovely walk through the park. The winter wonderland was on and even though we didn't go in to it it looked and sounded like a lot of fun. Only wish there were more signs throughout the park. When we arrived at the the Diana memorial fountain it was under construction or the sign was wrong and it wasn't were it stated. That was very disappointing. ||December 28, 2015
Gordinsummerlin||40||Way better than our city parks in Canada. Lots of paths leading to different parts of London.Turn right...your on Kensington Palace's side yard, turn left...your at Albert Hall...back up into Notting Hill...go forward and have a lay down in a meadow like setting. Great for people watching.||December 28, 2015
Luk v||30||Not what I expected. Just a lot of grass with a tree sometimes. There is also some kind of amusement park which completely spoils any serenity a park should have.||December 28, 2015
Francis H||50||I am a regular visitor here too, we love it, loads of coffee shops and loads of ducks swans etc to entertain you ||December 28, 2015
msxzy||30||Nice enough park in the middle of London. Fairly big area, good releif from surrounding buzz and traffic.||December 27, 2015
yuls_c||50||This is one of the best city parks we have ever visited. With so much water sport and other leisurely activities, this is a place that is suitable for everyone. As with any other attractions, beverages at the food stalls can be expensive, so do pack your own lunch and drinks!||December 27, 2015
Daniel R||50||Huge and always striking, you can do it all there: read, walk with your loved one, run (dozens of routes) or cross to your destination. Been in winter, would love to see it in the summer. ||December 27, 2015
dazzlesGLA||50||Visited the Winter Wonderland on the morning of 27 December 2015 which proved to be a fab time as it was relatively crowd free. What an absolutely wonderful effort for residents and visitors to London. Something for everyone - from amusement rides (great and small), haunted houses, bars, food outlets, stalls with a various array of goodies to purchase and also fairground attractions for winning cuddly toys and electronic goods! Make the effort to go and see for yourself - support the hard work by those involved in making it happen!||December 27, 2015
Luka D||50||Hyde park is famous with Kennigston garden and Kennigston palace where lived the Princess Diana. There also two memorial of her memory - the fontain and children ones.||December 27, 2015
Michelle H||40||We ended up here after going to Kensington Palace. Accidentally. We were walking in Kensington Gardens and wanted to see the memorial fountain for Princess Diana. We followed the signs and started walking. We walked for a very long time before we found it. If you like walking for more than 30 minutes you would appreciate the walk. ||December 27, 2015
AndrewDNZ||30||We spent a number of hours in Hyde park and winter wonderland and overall enjoyed the experience. The park is very nice and the amusement park was good fun. It was however very expensive and very busy. To be expected around xmas time. ||December 27, 2015

NAFigueiredo||50||When I went to Hyde Park in December, there was there a carnival named Winter in Wonderland that light up the park in the evening with lots of atractions and food & drinks stands.||December 27, 2015
muddystrats||50||Recommended for a good walk in the park.Even the squirrel are friendly. Walk further down you'll will find a beautiful lake whereas the swamp is.||December 26, 2015
Pavla_Kupsova||40||Especially around the lake-summertime- it's difficult to find a place to sit. Even if this park is huge, it's always busy. ||December 26, 2015
Marcia S||50||I have only seen a fraction of this London icon and loved every part of it, The walkways, foliage and vistas from every bench are, well maintained and will help you to revitalise within the bustling city.||December 26, 2015
Shan_the_explorer||40||We visited Hyde Park for Winter Wonderland. It's quite fun. The park is clean and having security all around was nice too. This park is also available in our big bus tour||December 26, 2015
kellyinoklahoma||50||If you want a place of quiet, perhaps for a picnic, this is the place. You can rent a canoe or a paddle boat for the large pond. Sunbathers will be everywhere on a warm day. Beautiful gardens, trees, benches, rose bushes||December 26, 2015

angelaY3641pf||40||Had a lovely morning at Hyde park, looked at angels market plenty of ideas for presents etc.Rides for adults and children, good atmosphere||December 24, 2015
Magellano81||40||Also placed it as the St. James Park in the heart of the city. Along the Bayswater Road, which leads to Oxford Street until you get to Marble Arch and districts like Chelsea and Notting Hill.Without doubt this is the largest city park and once inside you will realize that actually seems not to be in the heart of huge city like London.Meadows, trees, beautiful and well-groomed, a large pond with animals of all kinds.In short, the perfect place for relaxation and a bit 'of peace.||December 24, 2015

Very central and easy transport links to lots of restaurants nearby on the Edgware road, Kensington, Piccadilly and Oxford St.||December 23, 2015
jonotennis||40||Myself and a friend attended the annual Hyde Park Winter Wonderland on a Sunday evening in late December. We visited the Ice Kingdom (£7.50 pre-booked). Pros:-Free entry-Huge site - plentiful rides, food outlets and bars. Enjoyed the Bavarian Village. Ice Kingdom was great - amazing ice sculptures and even an ice slide. -Free live bands. -Underfloor matting throughout. -ToiletsCons:-£5 a pint-£3 chips-£5 hot dog-Clearer directional signage to the main attractions would be useful. Notes: Last orders 9:45pm prompt. ||December 22, 2015
596SteveH||50||Great night out spent a fortune But a good time was had by all The fair is amazing great rides but a bit priceySuper German sausages and beerGreat acts and was entertained||December 22, 2015
Clare720||40||Not to be missed. In December there is also the Winter Wonderland. This is a huge park with plenty to do, boat rides, horse riding, cycling. Plus of course you can walk.||December 22, 2015
Darkstone120||50||I always walk in Hyde Park when I go to London. It is a great place to see wildlife and removes you from the rush of the streets.||December 22, 2015
LesleySeoul78||40||A lovely park for a stroll. Wouldn't recommend it at night as the chances of getting lost are quite high. The swans and birdlife here are fantastic. A slice of heaven in a spralling metropolis. ||December 21, 2015
Ms_Need_A_Vacation||40||The Winter Wonderland was ongoing at Hyde Park when I arrived in London in early December. Although it was a tad kitschy but it was very festive and full of family fun.Just a walk through the park during Christmas gave you a warm and fuzzy feeling. It is a good place for family fun during the Christmas period.Do try to go early as the crowd can get insane by 4-5 pm and the nearest tube station was closed due to the overwhelming crowd visiting Hyde Park during the Christmas period. ||December 21, 2015
okrach||40||Christmas markets are the highlight of any winter trip to Europe so you have to check out the Winter Wonderland at Hyde park, especially after dark . it's definitely nothing like the markets in Germany or Eastern Europe, more amusement park like with rides and food trucks rather than christmas stalls, but great atmosphere nonetheless!||December 21, 2015
Aracha_backing||50||Hyde Park is a vast garden. There are several views And activities to do in this park. I take the time to explore the park shoot landscapes and animals in the park. ||December 21, 2015
alexander c||50||Beautiful parc with possibility to rent a bikePerfect to relax during the summerOr in autumn is beautiful with the tree , all this color Also perfect to run or diverse activities...||December 21, 2015
582christenet||50||I don't understand why people review winter wonderland under the Hyde Park attraction. WW is a temporary event located at Hyde Park. It's not permanently a part of the park. The park itself is beautiful and expansive. It's a safe place for a stroll during the evening. I always visit the park during my visits to London.||December 21, 2015
D97YTkimh||40||Hyde park is fantastic all time on the year and are you in London you must take a walk in this great park. We was there in juli and now again in december. It is a must when you are here in London.||December 21, 2015
Desigo||40||The biggest park in the heart of central London from Marble Arch to Hyde Park corner and Kensington at the other end. Walk if you have the time. In the winter its beauty is stark and in the summer there is boating and a restaurant . It is nice to drive through if you want to take the scenic route instead of taking the main roads. Great for cycling, jogging and taking the kids out .||December 21, 2015
Avnerc123||30||perhaps when the sun is out, it could be a lovely place to take a stroll or a jogg, but on a rainy day, when the place is equipeed with all the facilities of entertainment park, its more suitable for kids perhaps. plus, no one giving speches in the speaches cornter, we were disapointed.||December 21, 2015
Matkap M||50||that is the place to get in silence place in city of London , you can have some fresh air and enjoy the scenery of the beautiful park||December 21, 2015
vickysimonsophlill||30||Took my children yesterday 20th December. Bit overpriced but expected my only complaint was there is a ride which you walk around like the cake walk at the end there is a hall of mirrors (perspex) that you have to find your way out of.....my nine year old managed to walk into three of these panels hurting her nose her knee and blacking her eye...she was not the only child I saw three others one of them had blood pouring from his head....beware !!||December 20, 2015
RomseyChechy||20||This is a VERY EXPENSIVE fun fair. Most of better rides are £8 or £9 a head and last very little time. There are hundreds of stalls for 'winning' stuffed toys. As usual did not see anyone actually win. There are not any of the normal 'craft' stalls. Just food and drinks.We enjoyed rest of the park more||December 20, 2015
xristina v||50||A beautiful park in the heart of london, A great place to have a walk, run or just relax and enjoy the nature||December 20, 2015
duttash||40||We walked and on another occasion drove through parts of the park. Great place to people watch - there is so much activity. ||December 19, 2015
dd1004||50||i work close to hyde park and enjoy using it for jogging, softball, reading under a tree and everything else. In the middle you feel away from the surrounding traffic and metropolis. Avoid during the winter wonderland nightmare - just a moneyspinner causing congestion and some loutish behaviour- and enjoy it for the escape from the city.||December 19, 2015
Keiran F||50||Hyde park is so quiet and beautiful and set so close to the city centre. Once in the park, you would think your in the open countryside.||December 18, 2015
Claudia M||30||We stayed across the street from Hyde Park and had a nice walk through the park a couple of times. At the time we visited, they were setting up a section for the Christmas Holiday so a large section of the park was blocked off.||December 18, 2015
Vivnista||50||I love mooching around Hyde park. You need a couple of hours to check it all out. Visit the Diana memorial whilst there||December 18, 2015
Reasonable50||50||A peaceful refuge in the middle of all the hubbub. A beautiful park with many walking trails. My favourite spot is by the lake. There are various coffee shops around the lake where one can enjoy a cup of tea or coffee and enjoy the scenery.||December 17, 2015
TravelingTaki||50||Even on in a light rain this park's walkways were a pleasure. Lots of people out enjoying it but it's so big that you can stroll without major interruption. I wish my city had something similar in size and scope.||December 17, 2015
pdl03||50||One of the great parks in the world, this park offers excellent walking or sitting observation points that won't disappoint anyone. Great place to watch ducks and geese and people surrounded by historic London. Give yourself a couple of hours to mill around.||December 17, 2015
JeffT134||30||A very nice walk lovely gardens and wildlife in the middle of town. Quick walk to historic buildings - a great place as a tourist to ask the locals about the area and the history of the park.. Best to go in summer.. ||December 17, 2015
ASlightlyStrangeLife||50||We spent last summer in London, and used Hyde Park nearly every day.It's great for running around, with options of sandy track as well as tarmac.It's awesome for picnics, although very popular at times so hard to find a quiet space.There are also loads of attractions, ponds, lakes, buildings, statues.Did you know London has more public green space than any other European capital city.. :-)||December 17, 2015
japanlover1972||50||The fun fair was amazing with hundreds of shops and game stalls. They have many Bavarian beer gardens. Be prepared to spend a bomb tho. ||December 16, 2015
R601WYkeithw||50||Visited Winter Wonderland and was impressed with the size of the fair and the number of stalls offering a variety of food and drink, with something for everyone. Will be back next Christmas.||December 16, 2015
Italybird||40||Hyde Park is one of London's iconic beauties. It is mercifully big in a city where space is at a premium and it provides the serenity of a large lake. There is also a cafe there and used to be a restaurant somewhere in the Serpentine area which was very good - it may still be there so would be worth looking up. But Hyde Park is really about getting some fresh air into your lungs, looking up into an open sky and absorbing the nature around you and the sound of the wind in the trees. It has a magic of its own and a history that encompasses generations of Londoners who love their city and cherish its open spaces. There are of course things you might not like there - including a spectacular brown rat which crossed our path once many moons ago in the park. But given the beasts are only a few yards away from you anywhere in the city - in Hyde Park they're likely to be further away rather than closer to you - and blame litterbugs not the park or the rat! Seriously, Hyde Park is beautiful and relaxing and, when on a long walk, eases the city soul. After a tough day at work in the late 1990s I often walked home through the park - and that part of the walk was always the nicest - loveliest part. There are concerts and fairs there on special occasions, but the bliss is the peace you will find there. I have no particular date although I'm forced to give one for the sake of it. The park is not supposed to change from year to year.||December 16, 2015
Suzie G||30||A very pleasant stroll/commute between attractions, especially in deptgs of winter...just avoid Winter Wonderland at one end...a great, big, mobey grabbing fair of showrides, fairy flows and battered savs...||December 16, 2015
Sana G||40||Serene and nice place for long walks... I enjoyed walking even when it was drizzling.. brighter sunny day is of course better.||December 16, 2015
bobbyanna||50||We had great fun at the Christmas market, lost of great food to sample and wonderful gift ideas. It was a chilly day with scattered light rain showers, so we decided not to go on the ferris wheel but there was more than enough to see and enjoy!||December 16, 2015
703zackf||40||Really good but very expensive. Be careful and drink and food prices as everything was very expensive but lively to walk around with great atmosphere.||December 16, 2015
AMvAP||50||Beautiful park just outside the busy part of London. We visited Winter Wonderland, christmasmarket, skatingrink, German market and food||December 15, 2015
caroline j||50||A retreat in the heart of London, a very large park in central London which is peaceful. Lots to see around the park as you walk at your own leasurly rate.,||December 15, 2015
DK2DR||50||It's probably the biggest Park in london and souranded by lots of tube station from one end of Kensington to greenback at other and marble Arch on one. So many places to get in and get lost in the green with something or other hopping everytime you go there last time I went there and there was lice music concert and end of the year like this visit you will always have a winter wonderland. It's very much of large grass land with fresh sourandings with playing fields. Can visit anytime time and have a peaceful time.||December 15, 2015
ccif||50||Love Hyde Park. Winter Wonderland lives here at Xmas time. Surrounded by history it has its own interesting statues and memorials that you can look for. It serves as a great crossing place connecting Portobello area to Kensington, and Marble Arch over to Green Park.Serpentine lake gas pedal boats and of course there's the Lido!Great all year round. ||December 15, 2015
mcarch||50||Speakers Corner Sunday mornings is an area where open-air public speaking, debate and discussion are allowed and is is in the northeast corner of the park . Also worth a visit is the Serpentine lake ||December 15, 2015

Louisa M||50||I have to travel a long way to this park - from zone 6! But we do it a couple of times a year because its so great for kids. Our favourite is the Princess Diana Memorial playground, which is just like going to the beach (sand, water, palm trees, pirate ship) and very safe as its totally enclosed and with security. ||December 14, 2015
david p||50||Stunning park. You'd never think you were in the centre of a busy city like London. Chill out and visit it.||December 14, 2015
cazbatt||40||I'm sure the winter wonderland gets bigger and bigger each year. We've been this year and it was lovely. You can spend hours there going on the rides, browsing the stalls selling all sorts of gifts and treasures and there is so much choice for food and drink it's difficult to choose. We went on a Saturday night and even though it was busy it wasn't ridiculously crowded. It really is a wonderland! ||December 14, 2015
LYNNE P||50||We visited Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park during our stay in London . The whole experience was magical ,lots of funfair rides and attractions also 2 markets and a Cicus ,ice rink ,ice bar ,magical ice kingdom and plenty of places to eat and drink. A great family day out ! Best tip is to pre book online for the time slots you want .||December 13, 2015
Beeecky_L||40||If you, like me, enjoy walking around, walking around at Hyde Park in a summer day is one of the best way to enjoy London. When you finish your shopping at Harrods and you just want to chill for the afternoon, this is the place to go. ||December 13, 2015
HankW80||50||Beautiful London Park that is a great place to take a walk or to spend the day relaxing. Kensington Palace is on one end of the park and the Princess Dianna Memorial Fountain is a must visit as well. The park is very large so don't underestimate the amount of walking to get from one end to the other. London parks never disappoint!||December 13, 2015
LondonHijamaClinic||50||Another park in London which we love. A walk around the lake in the evening is beautiful. Lots of wild life||December 13, 2015
Karen C||40||The Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park is well worth a visit, it is massive and you would need to be able to spend a good few hours to walk round and see everything||December 13, 2015

S C||50||Don't miss visiting the Hyde park if you're ever in London. Walk, feed swans or just relax here. There is a free playground near Kensington palace which is built to honour the memory of Princess Diana. You may enter if you have a child with you. The toilets there are so clean and equipped.||December 12, 2015
Donna-Kaye K||50||It was fantastic watching locals and tourists alike out enjoying the sunshine. You really do feel like you've left London altogether. The Squirrels were a hit for me, as were the different areas on the gardens themselves. I didnt quite realise how big the place was until I got a bit lost and pulled out my phone to navigate. Good walking shoes and some money for an ice-cream is required.||December 12, 2015
Cindy C||50||Saw a bit of the park and experienced the winter festival. Thought the festival could have been a bit more varied, as food was basically all German. ||December 12, 2015
SydsontheRoad||40||Wasn't expecting as great a visit as it turned out! Great atmosphere not too crowded considering only 2 ish weeks before Christmas!||December 12, 2015

mikek794||50||Surrounded on all sides by noise, traffic, and bustle, Hyde Park is a massive refuge. Kensington Garden, the Serpentine, Rotten Row, the Speakers Corner, are all part of London at its best. Budget an hour, and £0 for a lovely experience.||December 11, 2015
Austin W||50||Hyde Park was a great place to walk around and take in the time there was good weather during my London visit. During December they have a fun Christmas Market called "Winter Wonderland". This is a fun thing to do during the day or at night. Mulled wine, beer, waffles, and anything else that you can imagine they have it.||December 11, 2015
itsjustShaun23||50||It was a warm day in the summer 2015 and we were going for a jog. I kept stopping but not because i was out of breath, oh no, took look at the stunning views this park has to offer. It is awesome but can sometimes get a bit crowded. :):):)LOL:):):)||December 11, 2015
beas006||40||It is a great pleasure to walk and stretch your eyes from the short sightedness of the city. Hyde park is big and rivals any park of the world. Great cafe, boating lake and Diana tribute make this a worthwhile trip.||December 11, 2015
nelsoncerqueira1||50||Whenever I'm in London I have to pay a visit to Hyde Park, especially with the vivid memories of Princess Diana's death, when I was at the park amidst thousands of people bringing flowers, candle and gifts to honor and mourn her death. I just love to get myself lost in the park and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere either in the summer or in the winter, but truly I'm never really lost with Princess Diana in mind. I can't hide in the park!!||December 11, 2015

MeganLLP||40||The sheer amount of space at this park is amazing. Excellent for some quiet down time away from the city. The ponds are good places to sit and watch the world go by. Visited in early winter so a warm drink in hand certainly helped.||December 10, 2015
HiddenCaviar||50||A great place to spend some time at Christmas. There is a big festival that takes place here and is worth visiting. ||December 10, 2015
TomWildenburg||40||Been here a couple of times. Form the concert of the Black Eye Peas, david guetta or the christmas carnival; thos park is iconic to London.

They got it all well set up at Hyde Park! ||December 10, 2015
roxy159||50||London is a pricey city but in the summer you can enjoy an afternoon in Hyde park with some store bought snacks. I go to Hyde Park regularly to poi. I love seeing the interactions of families, pets, horse riders, tourists - everybody! Maybe not a top tourist must see, but great to take some time out, grab a bite and rest your legs. ||December 10, 2015
GerDDuleek_Ireland||40||For the month of December Hyde Park place host to a Christmas Market of epic proportions - Winter Wonderland.

gulzeynepgenc||30||Hype Park- everyone loves I know- but is not more than a big area full of trees and a little lake... It is not like the tasteful parks you come by in Germany, France or Austria... Not so peaceful but you can enjoy it.One tip that might be interesting for you- there is a free-speech corner when you enter the park from Oxford St side. There many people there from different nationalities and with lots of ideas giving free speeches. You can also be one of them if you would like:)Enjoy!||December 9, 2015
msstarr718||50||I had no idea they would be having a carnival in the middle of Hyde Park in fall. I was amazed at how big the carnival was and that it was temporary. The staff was friendly and there was an abundance of food and beverage choices. This was the highlight of my stay in London that I came both nights I was here! Belgium waffles, mulled wine and German sausages, what more can a girl ask for. Oh yea and tons of rides and carnival games. I'm jealous we don't have a tradition like this in New York. I think I would visit London every year just for the Winter Wonderland. I had a blast!! ||December 9, 2015

bina78492||20||I have visited this park several times before. During my last visit I felt like I was in Dubai, rather than in the UK. There were gypsy beggars in the park, annoying. Would next time go to another park that London has to offer.||December 8, 2015

kc48owl||50||First visit to Winter Wonderland, which was wonderful. Signposting from tube station was very clear and there were plenty of people about to point you in the right direction or ask questions. Men organising road crossing were very enthusiastic and friendly and it made it nice that they were talking to you. Lots of stalls, eating and drinking and rides - something for everyone. ||December 7, 2015
Barry C||30||Had great day out. With the grand children mixture of snowdome and Birmingham German marketIn my view nothing beets the snowdome at Tamworth with grandchildren at Christmas This was a good day out with kids||December 7, 2015
elsiekate||30||Obviously, this park is huge. We started at the top edge of Kensington Gardens and somehow ended up at Hyde Park corner, not our original plan. Managed to get lost more than once! Still, it's a nice, relaxed place to stroll along and forget the chaos and bustle of London streets. We also took a trip to the Winter Wonderland. Great for families I would imagine, but otherwise not really my cup of tea. Did feel rather festive though. Beware, walking through Hyde Park to get there in the evening is interesting, it is most definitely not well lit after dark. Stick to the main roads!||December 7, 2015
Lynda1301||50||you don't need kids to enjoy this experience it was truly magical and free to get in which is great, Also food and drink within the experience were very good prices, similar to Manchester Xmas markets prices. The ice kingdom was fantastic and enjoyed the chill bar and cocktails.||December 7, 2015
SuzyQScotlandUk||40||Lots to see even on a Sunday morning the park is busy with everyone doing there own thing from sports, picnic, walking people watching or on the lake.||December 7, 2015

1ak1||40||A nice place to spend a sunny afternoon. One can just sit under the sun and watch visitors go around the place. One can very easily have good conversations with strangers over a cup of coffee / tea over the stands in certain parts of the park. A walk in this park can easily freshen you up after a hard day's work/ travel. ||December 6, 2015
Marilena D||50||wonderful and peaceful place. You can admire nature and all of animals that are there. Much of enjoyment||December 6, 2015

Tan8888||40||We walked through Hyde Park from one end to another in about 25 minutes on an early morning when it was cold and refreshing. The place was lively with squirrels, birds, swans and ducks going about their daily routine in the park. Even though it was winter and wet, it was still a nice stroll through the gardens.||December 6, 2015
MrsAFK||50||Everywhere you go it's pretty. It seems endless. There is everything in this beautiful park. Between Kensington and Bayswater there is a pond, a playground for kids , bikes. And if you go towards the serpentine you have the great Zaha Hadid gallery . You get to enjoy the pedal boats. There is horse back riding, another playground towards Knightsbridge . A beautiful cafe ... Basically the park is full of activities for all ages we all enjoy it.||December 6, 2015
Cruvinel A||50||It is just a beautiful Park to being visited, my eyes never get tired before such beauty!So many people walking around, children playing and laughing, it's just awesome!Every time I come here there's a free musical Concert on, for sure it is a place to visit in London.||December 6, 2015
Bubitzzz||40||Nice park and hotspot for people. who just want to enjoy their life. No matter of just relaxing or having fun, it's a must see in London!||December 6, 2015
vacationgirl58||40||We drove through the park, past The Serpentine, Winter Wonderland, The Serpentine Gallery and The Princess Diana Memorial.||December 6, 2015
Thomas J||40||We have been here for several trips and visited the park for different reasons - to attend concerts (The Proms), or just walk in and take a break from the big city noise, or as now - to visit the big Christmas & fun fair market! The park feels just as important for London Central Park is to New York. It is popular, peaceful, vast and green ... Do not miss Speakers Corner or the everyday spectacle around the pond. Julmarkjnaden was hilarious because it was very similar to the old-time amusement park in the US with rollercoasters, candy kiosks and dance courses - all in the glow of grand glittering neon lights!||December 5, 2015
Manuel7175||50||I always come here to relax and soak the sun.. if there is any.. :) it can be also romantic and good for sports ||December 5, 2015

ViceChick||50||Nothing nicer then a lovely Sunday stroll in Hyde Park on a beautiful autumn day - enjoy the boat ride, visit the galleries and visit the Diana memorial fountain. The only thing which would have made it better would be to have our dogs with us for the walk.||December 5, 2015
bof781||40||I suggest you at least once take your kids and approach the Winter Wonderland from the area of Marble Arch after dark - seeing all those lights in the distance, the towers and moving things, has a magical effect. Then when you arrive it's full of sounds, attractions, food places. It's big, not exactly cosy, but worth a visit.||December 5, 2015
Kathleen H||50||What a delight. Deffo need to visit if on a Xmas break to London. Lovely food, Xmas market fun fair. Makes you feel very Christmassy. Fun for all the family. Huge and well worth a visit.||December 4, 2015
Sunil T||50||If you want to get away from the hustle an bustle of London head to Hyde Park. It is just so relaxing and beautiful, a little chilly at the moment, but for a pleasant stroll to get away from the noise it is perfect. An idea is to head to the gallery and take in some art, and then to the cafe and just enjoy a coffee. You will not feel you are in the busiest city in the world.||December 4, 2015
BiancaD15||50||Haven't visited for a while as getting colder, but love it when I do. The park is so lovely and big you can walk around and get lost. Love being able to see over into the London zoo attactions. Makes our doggy walks even more interesting. ||December 3, 2015
Iva N||50||Loved it. Very fun and calm place. Lots of squirrels, and they are really frendly. Nice place to chill and relax||December 3, 2015
Mónica P||50||Everyday I cross Hyde Park from the hostel where I live to my workplace. I love it! It doesn't matter if it is raining, it is magical, and you don't feel like you're in the middle of the city. Great thing that gates open so soon, since sometimes I have to go around 5.30/6 am, that's when I love it the most, it is still dark but you can see a bit of the sunrise in the horizont. Is very magical! Also in Autumn you see the yellow and red leaves like in the movies. Great to visit alone or with friends/family, just avoid the areas that are full of children, it ruins all its magic a bit.The only downside to me is that they close the gates I need at around 4pm, so I have go around it to go back to the hostel, and the sights are not so wonderful.||December 3, 2015
KarenCCC2013||30||It's truly a great spot for families to enjoy , free entry, very christmassy. There were games, drinks, snacks and concert. However the weather typical in London winter was windy, cold and rainy. It might be better to come here on a sunny day. But yes, it is a must go if you are in London during winter.||December 3, 2015
bethanyann91||50||We came down from the North West to go to the Winter Wonderland. It was full of things to do, see, eat and drink. Lovely and christmassy!||December 3, 2015
Parmeet D||50||Green and Spacious Park Has a beautiful lake inside the park with birds and ducks. Please carry food to feed the birds.Hyde Park has a restaurant on the lake with excellent coffee options available.Amazing photography views inside the park.We visited at the time when Winter Wonderland is organized. Winter Wonderland is well planned with excellent rides , games and food planned for public. Entry free.||December 3, 2015
elawson||30||We walked our kids down to the Winter Wonderland. We're from the States and it was not magical at all. It was the equivalent of going to the boardwalk in Ocean City...definitely more of a carnival like atmosphere. Some of the artisan booths looked interesting but all the food was overpriced (though maybe not for London). I really wish I could have seen the Park in the summer when it didn't look so tacky.||December 2, 2015
Marea J||50||A morning drive through Hyde Park on the way to Imperial College was just delightful. Despite the light rain, joggers, cyclists and dog walkers were out in force. ||December 2, 2015

boondoggie||50||The 40-acre Serpentine Lake, dating to 1730, offers boating, but a stroll on both sides of the water reveals numerous birdlife : swans, ducks, geese and moorhens.Look norhtwards across Hyde Park Common and you'll spot happy couples and business people relaxing on the grass, or an impromptu football game hogging the centre field.Amongst the waterside strollers you will discover many nannies of all nationalities exercising their young wards. Look a bit further and you'll discover the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain.Hyde Park provides a couple of hours of respite from the bustling metropolis.||December 2, 2015
Annisa U||50||Public park. Free. Enjoyed morning walk. It was 9°celcius. Cold n chill. Many people walk their dogs around. But no dog's poops on the ground. There is specific dustbin for dogs' poop. So the dogs' owners r highly responsible. Overall its a good place for chilling out walking n run around with kids if u have. ||December 2, 2015
jayyen93||40||What a lovely green space in central London! In the midst of the compact urban environment, Hyde Park is certainly an excellent breath of air. If you ever find yourself overwhelmed by the packed city, take a breather at Hyde Park and relax by the Serpentine lake. Most likely there is a fun activity going on in this park so look out for that to give yourself more drive to visit. While it is nothing too extraordinary, Hyde Park is definitely a good spacious counterbalance that the crowded central London needs!||December 1, 2015

Bill M||50||There is nothing like a morning run around the Serpentine to stir the soul. It's a beautiful and tranquil respite from the hustle & bustle of Oxford Street. There is always something to see in Hyde Park. When I was there the popular Winter Wonderland carnival was on. It is a wonderful treasure in the heart of London. ||November 29, 2015

Fran B||40||Lovely park, especially in the summer/autumn, for a nice walk or cycle! The Serpantine is a good route to walk around. It is just a really great location for so many different sights in London too so easily accessible. They also do a Serpantine Gallery exhibition each year outside, this years was great!||November 29, 2015
mario a||40||Walked through park from our hotel to the museums. Lovely calm place out of the hustle and bustle. Great attractions all within walking distance. Princess Diana's memorial fountain, Round pond, Albert memorial, all worth seeing.||November 28, 2015
ROT1EastYorks||30||Had a few hours to spare around London so spent it wandering around Hyde Park it seems to be used for large events in central London now which are either being put up or taken down so stand alone there really is not much to say apart from its a large grass space in London which is rare.||November 28, 2015
Liz D||50||A walk through Hyde Park by day will take you back to the days of Regency London--especially if you spot some of the horseback riders. Bring some bread to feed the ducks along the Serpentine. I've also walked through it at night with friends and it was gorgeous and quiet.||November 28, 2015
aberanda||50||Fabulous greenery? Check. Art and sculpture? Check. Water bodies? Check. With speakers corner, the serpentine and the gallery, there is something for everyone in this sprawling London landmark. ||November 28, 2015
angooredcow||50||I was at Hyde Park 43 years ago. It was busy with speakers spewing their discontent to whoever would listen to them. The park was noisy and crowded with people from tree to tree. Rather insane!In contrast, this visit was quiet. I was at Hyde Park on a chilly weekday and no one was around to disturb the peace. Not one speaker! I was actually disappointed because Hyde Park is famous for its orators.Entertaining me instead, was a residential red fox which peeked out from its den to hunt surreptitiously for food. With one eye on the tourists, it wandered around extremely familiar with its environment. I spent quite a bit of time observing the fox since I have not experienced seeing a wild fox at such close quarters. Do not touch or try to feed although a tourist tossed parts of a sandwich at it.If I am not mistaken, there is also a private riding school here. I watched the horses being exercised and kids learning to ride on them. The park was a haven from a noisy and crowded city of London. It was clean with many park benches available. They lured weary tourists and locals to sit a spell. Overstimulated by the many activities in London, the green of the park soothed the eyes and calmed the nerves. There were many miles of pleasant strolling on grounds which were well-kept and manicured.Adjacent to Hyde Park is Kensington Gardens. This is even more beautiful than Hyde Park. If time permits, hike over to Kensington Gardens also. There will be no regrets. ||November 28, 2015
veronicavoko||40||Best way to see it all is on a bike! You can get around the whole park in an hour and a half. The park is great but maybe not as beautiful as some of the other parks in London due to the football field, car access through the park and mass crowds. ||November 28, 2015
impa1er||50||In most large cities you are unlikely to find such a large expanse of green as Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Its expanse attracts throngs of sunworshippers and picnicers in the summer. In off-peak times, it still offers enough sights to make it a worthwhile respite from the rush of the city. Hyde Park is adorned with many sculptures and statues worth seeking out along the pathways jutting out in all directions. The Serpentine is a particularly pleasant spot to do some bird and people watching, and even see an art exhibition at the gallery. When one says 'great' park, they mean GREAT in more ways than one.||November 28, 2015

The_Gilberts_SAUK||40||Really surprised at how well laid out and organized the Winter Wonderland is. Having visited the crowded Manchester Christmas Markets every year since they started, this is a refreshing change. The area is well laid out, with a variety of things to do, from skating, fairground rides for all ages, a room full of ice sculptures, markets, eating places and live entertainment. There is also an eating area designed along the lines of an 'Oktoberfest' complete with a sing-along. We had a good mooch around the markets then settled down with a mulled wine, a large portion of salmon cooked on an open fire (excellent) and listened to a chap singing an excellent repertoire of songs that included some Prince classics. All whilst sat next to a giant holding a woodpecker that whispered softly in German!||November 28, 2015
ADX92||50||London is one of those places that is just full to the brim of people, cars, noise, shops etc... But hyde park is within walking distance from the central hustle and bustle but it offers a really peaceful beautiful area which is great for picnics, walks, biking or just to clear your mind and get some 'fresh air'.

ThreePuttPat||40||I walked thru the park several times in late November. Crowds were sparse and the paved paths were in good shape. Quite a few folks were out walking dogs. Around the lake there were numerous beautiful Swans and Ducks that you can get close to which the kids seemed to enjoy. I'm not a jogger but if I was this is a great place for a run while avoiding the perils of London traffic.||November 27, 2015

Verna I||50||It was many years ago that I spent a week in a rented flat just down the street from Hyde Park and the famous Speaker's Corner. Aside from the park there was fantastic shopping just nearby. This was a part of the park where anyone could get up on their soap box, and speak to the passers by and get their message or thoughts out in the air. It was interesting to view the different people. The park is huge and quite lovely. We found a little grocery just on the street nearby and enjoyed a snack as we watched the people. I enjoy people watching, and appreciate different cultures and the different ways people dress and live & carry on. This was a purely enjoyable experience & I couldn't say a negative thing about it, except the time I was there was too short. ||November 25, 2015
100stiane||40||We had a nice day in the park, especially the first part by the fountains and feeding the birds. Unfortunately there was some construction which made us go a longer detour around - and which was too long for our kids ... ||November 25, 2015

950samanthah||40||I visited Winter Wonderland as part of my break to London. As I knew what I wanted to do there I booked all the attractions online which I am glad I did even though you can go in Winter Wonderland free the attractions you need to pay for, you can pay for them when you arrive but the queue was enormous ( I visited on a Sunday). I really enjoyed it. It can be very expensive we bought a pint of lager and a wine it was 11£, burgers were 7£ too. Me and my husband did the ice skating and the ice bar, ice skating was fab you get an hour on the rink. Ice bar was good but I've never been so cold, we only stopped in there for 2 minutes. It was an enjoyable evening and would definitely return but next time with our daughters as they would of loved it. ||November 24, 2015
Whadders||50||Great outdoor space to get away from the speed of London, also as it links in with Kensington Gardens a round trip can make it a good length walk. Quite a bit of wildlife from the water to woodland birds, squirrels and that well known local to London the Parakeet.Good walks around the park and there are cycle lanes where you can use the "boris bikes". There are road works in the section between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens which cause a little disruption.There are several cafes in the Park.||November 24, 2015
I4733BWroberta||50||Hyde Park is located in a beautiful region in London and is perfect for walks. I strongly recommend you take at least a few hours of your trip to London to walk around and look at the beautiful tress and gardens around.||November 24, 2015
HKlord||50||I walk through Hyde Park every single morning on my way into work. It is fantastic and has some lovelly walks, especially towards Bayswater Road. In the winter they also do 'Winter Wonderland' which is a fantastic festival with lots of rides and food from all over the world. I really reccomend it!. The only slightly annoying thing is that whenever they have a festival on they close off the path forcing you to walk through the grass, for me who is usually in a suit its annoying as my shoes get muddy. Only alternative is to walk a really long way round on the path. Other than that, best park in London bar none!||November 23, 2015
Anna K||50||Nice place to spend few hours walking and enjoying everything around. Nice lakes, also there is fantastic playground for kids.||November 23, 2015
David G||50||Pleasant walk passed Diana area and into Oxford Street. On way back entered from "Harrods corner" after dark and followed the lake back to hotel. Even then there were people strolling and sitting around enjoying the park. Reasonable amount of lighting.||November 23, 2015
HappyTraveller995||50||A long walk round the park on a chilly but sunny day. Perfect. We found it easy to park and had a great breakfast at the serpentine cafe before a lovely walk. Lots of birds and ducks but we didn't manage to see the Little or Tawny Owls today. ||November 22, 2015
NohaSIsmail||40||A must see in london where you can enjoy a nice walk and a tasty breakfast at serpentine. U can feel the birds and go cycling and enjoy the great scenery.

CKY281||40||Hyde Park is the most loved and protected green lung in London and may even be seen from the sky when aircrafts approach Heathrow airport. It is home to Speakers' Corner where anyone can speak their minds on any topic without complete freedom and large crowds are drawn here. On Sundays along Bayswater Road, paintings and art pieces are hung onto the park's metal grills for sale. This park is huge in size and is centrally located with easy access to public transport.This park is always alive with squirrels,birds and water fowls and people having fun being in the park. I visit this park during all my visits to London. This is a magnificent park for nature lovers and people who appreciate the space and time to disconnect from the material world to refresh and recharge. ||November 21, 2015
Ciaran G||50||Hyde Park is the place to be when the weather is great. You can easily spend entire days here just walking about and looking at the wildlife and people watching. During winter there is the Winter Wonderland which is also a must.||November 21, 2015

TeresaFariaBernardo||50||I have been at the Hyde Park to know the park, see the animals and just walk. It has lots of squirrels and other animals and there are always a lot of children laughing and running.

Singx9||40||Hyde Park is good for have a walk or a ride, it's really relaxing to enjoy the view and looking for birds around the park. As the park is quite big and I would like to visit several attraction points in a day, I hire a bike in Hyde Park. I have visited Kensington Palace then take a further ride to Green Park for Buckingham Palace. Bike hire free for the first 30 minutes.||November 16, 2015
Frankies_opinion||20||If you like walking, walking, walking and some more walking (like I do), go take a walk in Hyde park. You won't be disappointed unless it rains.Nice scenery, "away from the city".Just do it.||November 16, 2015

BigHugh51||50||This was our second visit to London. During our first visit during 2013, we had walked the entire length of Hyde Park and enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere of the park. We visited London for a second earlier this year and we were again fortunate, in being able to spend some time in this splendid huge park.As we walked along the path next to the Serpentine, there were many people enjoying themselves onboard pleasure boats, on the water. We also walked past the Princess Diana memorial fountain. The fountain was full of children paddling in the water whilst there were many family groups enjoying themselves in the fenced grass area surrounding the fountain.Hyde Park is a great place to take a break from hectic tourist activities. There are plenty of park benches where you can give your feet a rest. If however, you feel the need to stretch your legs then there are plenty of paths through the park where you can take a good long walk.||November 15, 2015
lovetotraveljch||50||We stayed for three days in London, staying in the Lancaster Hotel, located RIGHT across the street from Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. We walked through the park on our way to visit Harrod's. Even though it was October, the weather was great. We were there on a Sunday and the park was being used by many people. Some just sitting and watching the ducks in the Sanctuary (the lake), some riding bikes, some playing baseball, some flying kites. It was so quiet and peaceful you would never know you were in a huge city. Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are basically one property with a large lake separating the two. On the Kensington side is a fountain in Diana's memory. Everything was so clean; no litter. ||November 15, 2015

Delco2607||50||New York has Central Park, London has Hyde Park. It's the green heart of the city and my favourite park so far. Depending on where you go in the park, the landscape changes a lot! Some parts are wilder than others. And the squirrels are every where!! So cute||November 12, 2015
elekesla||40||This park is huge and has the Albert Memorial at one corner and Speaker's Corner and Marble Arch at the other. London is fortunate to have many well looked after open space and parks. Best way to see many of these quickly is a hop on hop off bus.||November 11, 2015

honestreviewer201||50||Whenever we visit London, we always take a walk through Hyde Park as is is so nice. Go to the far end near Kensington Park and see Diana's memorial fountain, it is lovely and even nice to dip your feet into in November!! You can take a rowing boat out or a pedalo. There are two very nice, but very busy cafe's, one in the centre on the beginning of the lake and one at the end. There are plenty of public toilets to use, which are very well looked after. It is great to see so many local people enjoying family picnics. A must do when visiting London.||November 11, 2015
FiddlingTravelNotes||50||London is so lucky to have Hyde Park. It's our favourite park for running and it feels great be there with a bunch of people running in the park!. We love the ponds and swans!!||November 11, 2015

sadunalp||50||I have been Londo for several times but had no chance to visit this lovely place.After I finished my job I had time to visit his place and very impressed.In the middle of London how they kept this place very well.Very clean everywhere is in grass and big trees.Also artificial lakes are available,ducks inside.People are walking around running sitting and people are not interested with each other,everybody is dealing with their own job.So nice place so nice atmosphere,if you are in London please do not hesitate to visit this lovely park.||November 11, 2015
dapounet||50||When you come from France where parkk are small, with people everywhere, it's unbelievable! There is so much space there, a green lung in the city, it's impressive. Finally, if you want to see squirrels, you should definitely go there! ||November 11, 2015
yankeefan730||50||We were saying only a couple of blocks from Hyde Park and so made several walking trips through the park. Absolutely huge, with so much to see from gardens, to statuary, to waterways, even a palace (Kensington). Lots of benches all over the park to sit and watch the world pass by, or rent a bike as many others do in order to explore the park. There's even a special place for youngsters with the Lady Diana Playground not that far away from the palace.||November 10, 2015
EllieDaley||40||Hyde Park is a beautiful park, arguably one of the nicest in London. Very close to Buckingham Palace and features lots of lakes, activities and statues. Be careful you don't get lost and head in the opposite direction to Buckingham Palace. When I stayed in London with friends we rented Barclay's bikes and cycled around Hyde Park and through the marble arch, down the Mall to Buckingham Palace. A lovely place to have a quiet walk, especially in the Summer months. Hyde Park corner is the closest tube stop, not far from London's central attractions. Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland which runs throughout December is always a fun, festive event with Christmas markets, funfair rides and ice skating, fun activities for all ages. ||November 10, 2015
Robbie_GT||50||Both Kensington and Hyde Parks are beautiful places to walk, especially in the fall with the beautiful foliage. The two parks blend seamlessly into one another.The Princess Diana Fountain is one of the most creative water features that I have ever seen. The water modulates from calm and placid to dancing to racing torrents. Truly the story of a life.||November 10, 2015

danstratford84||50||Hyde park sits right in the heart of the city.

Hardys607||50||We were there on a beautiful sunny day, we walked to the Princess Diana memorial fountain, and saw lots of children enjoying this. The Queen Victoria memorial was Impressive, the trees that were flowering were lovely and we walked down the middleWhere it was closed off to dogs, I saw two squirrels which are a novelty to NZ'ers.This area was just beautiful, loved the large thistle plants, it's a shame the flowersWe're not out, a very beautiful park worth a visit.||November 8, 2015
maryfort c||50||This is a beautifully kept park, probably more impressive in the summer when vegetation is in bloom, but also peaceful at any time. There were no speakers when we visited, but in the summer anyone with a cause or opinion can stake an area for communication. This park is adjacent to Buckingham Palace and a great short-cut from the area tube station.||November 8, 2015
nova395||50||This is a very beautiful park. It's huge so I didn't walk the whole thing but I walked through a good part of it, along the sidewalk where the gorgeous trees with it's fall leaves shedding lined the sidewalk, along the water, and through the grass and trees. There were lots of geese and some ducks hanging out on and near the water! November is a great time to visit!||November 8, 2015
CLMinty||40||I have been here many times and it's a beautiful park to walk through from one end to the other particularly in Summer and Autumn. It is also a great idea to go on the Lake as well. ||November 8, 2015
Karen B||50||Hyde park is pure romance for my husband and I . We fell in love 8 yrs ago in the park while running together. I was over the moon seeing dogs enjoying leash free run time and seeing ducks in the beautiful ponds. This park is far more interesting than New Yorks Central Park and I'm thrilled to be a lucky Canadian living in the UK. ||November 8, 2015
Kristyrichtr||50||This park was the first stop after the whole night drive by bus from Glasgow - we couldn't have found better place to have breakfast. The sun was shinning, the grass was soft, ducks and runners everywhere.

Do find the Diana's Memorial Fountain, great place to dip your feet in during hot days,||November 8, 2015

TooOldtoRun||50||I took a few hours from a recent business trip to walk in Hyde Park. It was wonderful. The park is an oasis of nature in the middle of the city. I recommend that you do as I did, pick up a lunch and eat it in the park sitting on the grass like I did.||November 7, 2015
TheBestCook||40||One of the most famous parks in the world. I have found it to be a source of quiet and respite away from the traffic and crowds of London.Every season brings new sights and sounds.

TallyHoTraveller_13||50||Hyde Park is a fascinating place to while away a morning or afternoon -- there's so much more than just green grass and park benches! You can walk down to see gulls standing on uprights in the water, watch graceful swans swim near the elaboratively decorative Queen Victoria fountains, chuckle as you watch children learn to ride at the Hyde Park stable's arena, pause to reflect at the Princess Diana water memorial or simply enjoy all the various works of art within the Park grounds. One of my favs is the Peter Pan 360 degree sculture -- it's so very detailed from every angle!||November 6, 2015
grbzozge||50||Hyde Park is a "must-see" when you visit London. It is enormous, romantic and ideal for long walks. On a rainy day, you can rent a bike and ride through the park. On a sunny day, it is ideal for picnic plans. It is the land park of London.||November 6, 2015
LVagabond2014||50||Well maintained. Gorgeous trees. Fairly large pond with various types of birds. Properly paved walking paths that are designed to prevent pedestrians from slipping when it rains. Definitely suited for a much longer visit to just relax and enjoy its serenity.||November 6, 2015
Nada F||50||I come regularly to this park whenever I am in London. I actually prefer to stay next hyde park. The location is perfect it is next Marble Arch and Oxford Street which is the best street to shop from. In the Hyde Park you can do a lot of things such as feed the squirrels, ducks, swans, go for picnic, walk under the trees, and finally stop to eat something. Also, you ride a bicycle and take a tour all over the park. I really recommend this park you have to visit it when you come to London next time.||November 6, 2015
Cláudia B||40||Feed the squirrels, the ducks and swans and if you have something left you can do a picnic there too. Its exactly what you need after spending hours walking inside the museums nearby (Science M. and Natural History M.). ||November 5, 2015
M P||50||We come here regularly whenever we visit London. My son likes to bring a bag of nuts so that he can feed squirrels. Great place to relax and have picnic on a sunny day or splash in puddles when it rains. We loved picking blackberries this October and were amazed others did not have the same idea - they were delicious! ||November 5, 2015
carole B||50||I simply love love love Hyde Park....calming...beautiful..at any time of year....but for me nothing beats a stroll through the magical colourful wonder of this adults playground..as i'd like to describe it ..of rich natural beauty....catch a glimpse of a cheeky squirrel clambering up a tree trunk....& just be.....few places else where that i'd rather be on an autumnal afternoon..gather friends family & loved ones...and just walk.......your way to happiness!!!!||November 5, 2015

noeliao656||50||Hyde park is always a good idea...even for rainy days. Public transport gets you comfortably to the park, there are a lot of coffee shops and great atmosphere around too. Sunny days in summer are the best specially for picnics if you are a nature lover too.||November 4, 2015
Linda C||40||What a fun surprise! We walked through Hyde Park en route to the Churchill War Rooms and were slowed down quite a bit with all there was to see and enjoy. I was nervous when I saw SO many geese (usually not a friendly critter), swans and even pelicans, but they are so accustomed to people that they were quite relaxed and calm. We had a nice, slow stroll and really enjoyed this beautiful open space, the leaves changing and the wildlife.||November 4, 2015

Lori_b_20||50||This is a great place to take an afternoon walk. I stopped at a cafe to have a coffee and watch the birds and people. The trees are beautiful if you want to take pictures. There was also a skate club there practicing which was fun to watch their tricks. ||November 4, 2015
Naor C||50||This park is one of the biggest parks in London, it is very central and quite famous which means you will encounter many tourists and also locals in the park.If you go there on Sunday, don't miss the famous "Speakers Corner" where you can hear people preaching and lecturing about different topics.Look for the Peter Pan Statue which is always a pleasure to see.You can also see many different birds in the park, such as swans, ducks and even parrots! it's advised not to feed the birds with things such as crisps, bread, etc... because it is not good for them, you can feed them with vegetables or seeds (birds food).||November 4, 2015
Mourad A||50||A sanctuary, this is Hyde Park , people and nature can meet in an urban oasis with the opportunity to watch nature .It is a place for events you can watch,relax and you will enjoy nature.||November 4, 2015
Legal_itinerant||50||It's hard to believe that you can feel so free and enjoy all this space in the heart of London. One of the best places in the world to visit with friends and family outdoors. There is always something interesting going on here and you need to take your time strolling through its many paths although most people just walk through or cycle through it to get between the north and south ends. Open most of the day but closed at night.||November 3, 2015
happies_travel_bunny||50||Hyde Park is my absolute favourite London park - you can completely forget you're in central London and walk the length from Kensington Park to Hyde Park Corner.Just make sure you go early, especially in Summer or on weekends (I'm talking hitting the park at 7am) as it's tourist free and you're only sharing paths with the runners. Make sure to reward your early start with a trip to the Serpentine Bar and Kitchen for breakfast - which gets impossibly busy by mid-morning in the summer.||November 2, 2015
richkendrick||50||Escape the bustle of inner London by nipping in for a stroll around the Serpentine Lake. Gorgeous place in early autumn, with the trees all golden yellow and fiery red. Feed the swans and other birds around the lake and watch the people from the comfort of park bench.||November 2, 2015
727tracyw||50||I flew in to London on a Friday afternoon and because I was close to Hyde Park it was the first place I visited in London. I spent 2.5 walking around the park. I was lucky because I had a beautiful sunny summer day.I really liked that the different areas of the park contained different types of trees and plants. The lake was lovely with swans on one side and boats on the other. It also contains some lovely statues and fountains. There are lots of different paths to walk. I think it would take a lot of time to fully explore it.||November 2, 2015

Vesna M||50||Londoners really know how to enjoy their Hyde Park. I hope they don't take it for granted. It's a beautiful, relaxing place where you can enjoy in peace and quiet or voices and crowds. A couple more snack bars wouldn't hurt - it gets really busy during lunchtime.||November 1, 2015
Tekaia R||50||From Lancaster gate straight along Diana beach to Harrods or to the right to Kensington garden ( wonderful labyrinth) and then left to Alert Hall... This park is fabulous. ||November 1, 2015
anna1760||50||We walked through Hyde Park a few times on our way to other places and sometimes just to enjoy the park. IT was a great place to get a sandwich and sit on a bench for some quiet time. Lots of people in the park walking, playing, riding bikes, many dogs, most well behaved. We did not take the time to walk all the way around the park but did do the one side on Bayswater where the Artists had their paintings out on Sunday and that was great, bought some little fridge magnets to take home and share with family.||October 31, 2015
Lou C||40||I visit this park regularly and it feels like walking in the countryside every time. The Serpentine area is just beautiful and you have the convenience of two cafes! you can decide to have a tour of the lake on a paddle boat.||October 31, 2015
lui w||30||It is centrally located in the heart of city, walking distance to many attractions. Big but nothing special. I am a little disappointed. It rich in history and so famous. It is hard to find a good place to rest, and lack of amenities like public toilet.||October 31, 2015
Natashad19||50||I loved this park! The park is just stunning we had a great time enjoying a peaceful stroll while enjoying the beauty. Between Hyde Park and Kensington Park there are so many nooks and crannies to explore.||October 31, 2015

gemini2016||40||One should visit Hyde park as it has its own beauty surrounded by trees and flowers this magnificent park has its own charm. It is located in Central London where you get to eat food and also have drinks. Also many shops surrounded around the park especially Oxford Street. Guys do visit it if you want peace and privacy with your near and dear ones.||October 31, 2015

Milesandmiles2||50||We had a two day break in London just around the corner from Hyde Park. We were lucky to have warm weather and had a picnic in the park. We walked through Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park and it is really nice to have this open ground in the middle of a busy city . And it's free! Lots to look at for young and old alike....many people were jogging around the parks , but there is plenty of room for everyone. Well worth an afternoon if you can spare the time.||October 29, 2015
aorton||50||This is a beautiful park and a great place to spend the afternoon. Once you are inside the park it is so quite you easily forget you are in the middle of London. The pond is wonder. You can rent boats, but the day we were there the pond was very congested with boats. There is also a cafe located near the pond with indoor and outdoor seating. ||October 29, 2015
Taylor T||50||The park was right by my hotel and I loved walking through it. Beautiful on an autumn day and a peaceful break from the city. ||October 29, 2015
MarceR87_ARG||50||I went on Christmas Eve. It was really busy. There were entire families and groups of friends everywhere.Lots of things to do and places to go in the park. From hundreds of locals with food from all walks up games for kids and adults, breweries, craft fairs, shows music / live theater, etc.It is advisable to take care of belongings, due to outbursts. I did not feel insecure, however I saw a lot of policemen, and repeatedly observed safety recommendations.||October 29, 2015

MySweetShadow||40||Every metropolis has at least one large park where people (locals and visitors alike) can calm down and recharge their batteries for a while. I suppose Hyde Park is London's own such place. There's not much to it: it's generally peaceful and quiet (although there can of course be running/screaming kids, joggers, and even horse riders), a nice place to sit down for a while. If I had to protest about something, it would be that when I visited (October 2015) the responsible authorities didn't seem too keen on keeping it clean. It wasn't exactly dirty, but there were debris here and there.||October 29, 2015
Gadd3||50||The Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park offers the perfect Sunday walk after some days of museum visits and shopping in London. The park is very tidy, well groomed and has a thriving wildlife. There is also small resturants spread across the parks where you can get a cup or coffee or a snack for lunch. Highly recommended!||October 28, 2015

Chrissy C||50||I didn't go see the memorial of anything I basically nipped in to rest my feet and enjoy the sun.It was beautiful and there seemed to be plenty of space and happy faces about. I wasn't impressed at paying £1.85 for a cuppa that wasn't even has big as my hand ||October 27, 2015
G342BCmattl||40||Met some Friends at the Dianna memorial playground with our little boy. what a great place to take your kids. just be aware that it will be a struggle to get them to leave. and apparently in summer you may have to queue to get in.||October 27, 2015
EJW123London||40||I cycle through here everyday - a sanctuary in the heart for London. Wonderful for seeing the leaves falling, blossom in the spring, deskchairs and peddlos in the summer and the odd snowman in the winter. Always full of runners and cyclist. ||October 27, 2015
Le_Sabbaghov_Vert||50||It was right next to our hotel and we enjoyed walking inside the park every morning and evening. You can pick up a bike for a ride and enjoy the lovely nature inside. We loved it so much and would definitely enjoy living next to it forever.||October 27, 2015
Marla H||50||Yes it is full of fun history. But all in all it is still just a grassy park. Enjoyed going for a short walk just so I can say I went. ||October 26, 2015
Jan H||50||Well worth a visit especially round the serpentine and the princess Diana memorial fountain.Don't miss the Henry Moore sculpture which is beautiful if you see it from the opposite side of the water ||October 26, 2015
coberenson||50||This part has lots of bikes and people enjoying the park. It's quite large. Great place to relax and enjoy nature. ||October 26, 2015
Brittany P||50||Love London parks. They have an effortless and timeless beauty. Walk along the pond/lake in Hyde Park. Nice place for a stroll.||October 26, 2015
Andrew-Leakey||40||Excellent green space in centre of London. Well worth a visit especially to watch people feeding duskcs geese etc. Diana playground is a must see for kids - great pirate ship to play on||October 26, 2015
SMV5||50||Hyde Park is located right in the centre of London just off the West End. It contains a nature reserve and a lake which has paddle boats. It has lots of walkways and two main cafes.||October 26, 2015
Oliver R||50||Wonderful! A little cafe re-constructed from an old home, right at the entrance of the park, the food was delicious and freshly made, the staff were kind and welcoming too. The lovely view of the park topped it off. A relaxing experience, I highly recommend visiting The Lodge Cafe to anyone!||October 26, 2015
snipsy||40||Lovely park and close to where we were staying.Nice to have a walk in the mornings. Peaceful and tranquil ||October 26, 2015
MirkaL75||40||The Princess Diana's memorial playground is lovely, something different! I visit there with my 13-year-old daughter and also she loved it!||October 26, 2015
Beyondships||50||Hyde Park is a vast green space in the middle of London. It has nicely landscaped park and pretty gardens. In the middle of it is a sizable lake where you can go rowing or rent a paddle boat. There are also restaurants in the park.On its western side, Hyde Park merges almost seamlessly with Kensington Gardens It too has fine gardens. Of course, Kensington Palace is there too.On the southeast, Hyde Park is catty-corner with the Green Park, which once was the formal approach to Buckingham Palace. At the northeast corner is the Marble Arch, which once stood in front of Buckingham Palace.In any event, Hyde Park is a great place to relax and escape the bustle of the busy city.||October 25, 2015
Mark B||50||Reminds me of what old London might have been like. So huge and a lot of wide open spaces. I was here around Christmas time. A little cold so make sure you get some nice roasted chestnuts to warm you up a bit as you walk through the park.||October 25, 2015
RirinCen||50||Im a big fans of park, love spending a lots of time just sitting on the park accompanied by a great book or a mini picnic.They says Hyde Park, one of the largest parks in London. They have serpentine lake. A huge lake, that you can take a boat in it. And theres a rute for cycling, skateboard, or rollerblade. Even sport center too. You can play tennis, golf, bowling! This is really really a huge park. ||October 25, 2015
Ghotrainth||40||i been to this park on last christmas and had a great time with my friends and i am eagerly waiting for this christmas. i want to enjoy that hot german wines and wana fell in love with this place again.||October 25, 2015
Carl C||40||Great park especially if you are on side with America's first amendment. Yup this is the home of free speech, where anyone with the gumption and a soap box can hold forth on your subject of choosing. ||October 25, 2015
obuasi||50||First visit just to the park in over 50 years as simply never had time visiting London before. We went to let the 2 grandchildren aged 3 and 6 let off steam. The park in Autumn was an array of beautiful colours of reds , orange and Browns. Seems to be a park for everyone from joggers,cyclists, horse riders and walkers and kiddies. There were several places to get food and you could have a full English overlooking the Serpentine. There were a whole variety of waterfowl around the water, who were not in the least bit bothered about people. Squirrels happily came up close in case there was any chance of having a tasty titbit! You could also see and hear the green ring necked parakeets throughout the park.We walked as far as Princess Diana's water fountain which was sadly disappointing. There are play areas for the children but we didn't make it to Princess Diana's playground as we ran out of time.||October 25, 2015
Krasina M||50||Been there few times. It is perfect for a walk, chilling on the grass, having tour in the lake, have some food or just lie down and enjoy the park. ||October 25, 2015
Roger B||50||Stumbled onto park,early evening. A large, large park to walk your dog or just enjoy the fresh air. Pretty pond w swans swimming, and a lovely escape from the busy streets for some solace and meditation. Enjoyed by walkers, joggers, bike riders||October 25, 2015
AnaS772||50||Any time of the year is good to visit the park. It is a huge place just in the middle of a wonderful city, but after 3 minutes you can easily forget that you are still in London. Lakes, animals, green areas, flowers and courtes. A coffee to take away in any of the coffee shops of the garden and a pair of confortable boots, and that is just a perfect day for me. It does matter if rains, snows or if you are lucky and there is a brigth sun on the sky!||October 25, 2015
cathydyakiewicz||40||Been here many times when the weather is nice you won't believe your in London. Take a picnic !! Sometimes we get bikes and cycle around.||October 25, 2015
sandyTaiwan||50||It's so natural beauty , there are huge space ,especially located in middle of downtown which it's good for people who live in city to hang out ,enjoy lovely time there ,I rode a bike and listened my music and soaked in sun shine , I saw some bigger ducks and some domestic birds which also enjoy their time time there ,it's wonderful , I also passed by Albert Hall ,near by there .非常寬廣的地方又有天然的景觀適合騎腳踏車ㄛ.||October 24, 2015
RafaMaioral||40||hyde park is a classic visit and a must see in London. A lot of open air space, people running and also great for cycling.||October 24, 2015
Patricia D||40||The last time I was in London with my husband, we walked around the park but couldn't get to take nice pictures as it was a gray day. This time, we visited with my daughter and had a wonderful time; it was a bright sunny day so we could enjoy the park as much as possible!||October 24, 2015
David R||40||We spent an hour just walking around the park and sitting in the sun near the lake recently and it was a great autumn activity. There are lots of birds around and squirrels which is nice although they only want to be fed which isnt encouraged but lots of people do anyway.||October 24, 2015
andypdm||40||London's parks are probably the best ones around the world, the weather is the perfect one to keep everything green and beautiful through the year. Hyde park is huge, we can hardly review the thing as a whole. It is worth it to just get lost and enjoy the different parts like the rose garden, the serpentine or the more jungle like bits. Great fun.||October 24, 2015
ShamimA785||40||I have been to many parks in the world but saw nothing like Hyde Park.An amazing place for all; kids and grown ups.I loved The Speaker's corner and Diana Park.Highly recommended for everyone to visit.||October 23, 2015
Fouz_Alsharqawi||50||go any time of the year, pack ur lunch and get a book.. kids can play and feed the ducks, take a stroll or just lay on the green grass... one of the best FREE activities in London ||October 23, 2015
uptowngirl57||50||I've been to London so many times that I sometimes feel like a native, and one of my favorite things to do is run in Hyde Park and answer "tourist" questions - where is Princess Diana's monument? Where is Rotten Row? Where is Kensington Palace? Where is Speaker's Corner? They are always surprised at my American southern accent! Make sure to walk out on the Kensington side to see Royal Albert Hall.||October 23, 2015
John P||30||I have lived 20 years a stone´s throw from Hyde Park. How can one possibly "rate" it? It is like trying to rate Central Park in NYC. Well, it is very large, very green, with a lake, swans, and lots of trees. The nice thing on a good day is just to stroll around it. Don´t miss Speakers Corner (the Marble Arch end) where you can experience the blatherings of all sorts of nutty people, mainly religious fanatics...and join in if you feel like it !!!. But Kensington Gardens is much nicer.||October 22, 2015
K K||50||A great place to stroll, people watch, visit some of the memorials, or the curious speaker's corner. Hot dogs are £4.50 at the small stands - that's a bit rich for mystery meat. The presence of life rings along the Serpentine water feature is very civilized. Many children were using the motorized self-balanced hov-board scooters in the park; a clear indication that today's parents have abandoned the idea that walking is an option for their children. Inline skaters & rollerblade blast music while they skate around & between pylons - some of their moves are impressive.||October 22, 2015
jackos632||40||A great park with plenty to do, from boating/pedalowing on the river to sitting in Benugos restaurant looking out over the main lake area its a lovely day out. Marble arch sits at one end with it running down park lane and hyde park at the bottom. If you walk the other way it can take you all the way to Kensington gardens. Its a great park with a great vibe and bang in the centre of london! ||October 22, 2015
Nanette L||40||On my trip to London, many of our walks went through this magnificient park. Worth a visit. nice atmosphere ||October 22, 2015
estherk50||50||A lovely park to walk in . Can buy food there are many coffee shops and more upmarket places to have a more substantial meal.Places to sit to watch the swans , ducks and other birds.Italian garden as well, closer to Paddington entrance.Can walk through to go to Kensington Gardens . There are many statues and monuments throughout.||October 22, 2015
Phil W||50||Hyde Park is a great place to have a walk, enjoy the sun (or rain), and get away from it all. Its also a great through route if you don't want to spend all your time on the tube. For someone who has a few hours to kill, there's a great deal to see and do.||October 21, 2015
Julie M||50||We arrived in London on the day we visited Hyde Park. It was a beautiful day. Lots of people out and about just enjoying the sunshine (which thankfully lasted for our 6 days in London). We hired bikes and rode through the park to Kensington Palace and the Diana, Memorial Fountain. Having just got off basically a 24 hour flight it was a nice way to keep ourselves awake. Mind you on a sunny Sunday afternoon there were plenty of people around. Through the week it was much quieter. Lots of people running and exercising. It's a lovely place to escape the hustle and bustle for a while.||October 21, 2015
ChelseaCav||50||Beautiful escape from the madness of the city! whether you visit during the warm sunny summer, or the cold winter it really is worth a visit!Walking around Hyde Park is so relaxing and utterly breathtaking, you won't believe you're still in central London! lovely to have a break and a picnic too!||October 21, 2015
Gerd D||40||Nice place to take a walk in. good for some relaxation in a busy big city. Interesting memorial places.||October 21, 2015
Melvin C||50||It's a massive park, will take a long time to walk around it. Really nice space to play a bit of football or even frisbee as there is a lot of open space. It can get pretty busy in the summer/hot days but you expect that.Hyde Park definitely a nice place to walk around or even have a jog. Santander bikes are available inside the park if you don't have a lot of time. Take a bike out and ride around it.||October 21, 2015
29travel||50||Hyde Park is definitely a good escape from the fast paced life in London! It's a good place to just hang out or do fun sporty activities with family and friends! They offer Barclay's bikes which you can ride around the park which is a lot of fun as well!||October 21, 2015
ivkap2014||50||I was amazed by beautiful nature in the city centre. There are many squirrels and they will come to you if you offer them some food :) ||October 21, 2015
Hitchcock2||50||Just off the far end of Oxford Street, the Marble Arch end Hyde Park begins. It stretches for ages and provides the most perfect opprtunity to forget the hustle and bustle of the stores. On Sunday Speaker's Corner should not be missed where every Tom, Dick and Harry can voice their opinions no matter how radical without fear of being arrested! There are several delightful statues such as the Fountain of Joy and Dunamis,close to Hyde Park Corner depicting a circus performer balancing an elephant on one hand. If visiting with children they will enjoy these and can then run around and let off steam. It would be a shame not to find time to come here.||October 21, 2015
theuptownlife||50||enjoy the view of the swans by the lake al fresco dining. very cold but still worth it. visited during december they had a christmas market which was lovely. ||October 21, 2015
starlight010||50||This place is fantastic , from the hussle and bussle you come into Hyde park and you wouldn't think you were in London so much to do and see here and very clean.||October 20, 2015
Eileen B||50||Hyde park is nice to go to, away from shopping and walking.Sit back relax and take in the piece and quite.Nice to hire a bike and cycle through.||October 20, 2015
reyanshul||40||Vast green space in the middle of one of the busiest and most expensive cities in the world! Good for a morning jog or an evening stroll and perfect for a sunday picnic when there is nice sunny weather!||October 20, 2015
N4805BGkimberlys||50||Our hotel was directly across the street, so this park was a natural spot for early morning runs. Locals can be seen walking their dogs, which I enjoyed tremendously. There are several monuments/statues in the park and the detail is phenomenal. Take some time out while in London & check out Hyde Park.  ||October 20, 2015
loesbrems||50||This park is worth a visit. It's very big, so you'd probably only visit a part of it. There are a lot of squirrels (and they come close if you let them!), there are a lot of birds (swans and ducks by the water). If you walk on the grass parts, you can avoid to big crowds.||October 20, 2015
raii87||50||A great location for a walk, to read on a bench or just have a coffee watching the peaceful lake. A short walk from the center, beautiful flowers in the summer!||October 20, 2015
Rhonda J||50||I hired a bike and rode through Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens for a couple of hours. There's so much to do - row boats and peddle boats, feed the birds, ride a bike, lay in the sun. And the squirrels are so cheeky. ||October 20, 2015
Isabella G||40||I absolutely love Hyde Park! It's very nice and peaceful at times, but it can also be really crowded. The surroundings are beautiful and it really is a must see in London. ||October 19, 2015
LacSteph||40||If you're like me and you love these small animals, you should go visit Hyde Park. The squirrels aren't really scared of you, so it is easy to take really nice close up pictures. Also, the park is really nice! It's a great escape from the big city of London!||October 19, 2015
Carol D||50||You would hardly believe that you are in the centre of a city as this is such a beautiful park. We look a stroll through on a Saturday morning. ||October 19, 2015
BetsyDuck||50||Hyde Park is a lovely green place to sit and watch the dog walkers, the children playing, the joggers, or if you're lucky, horses strolling by. It's lovely and large. It's a park. So, go there if you like grass.||October 19, 2015
Roger S||40||Loved the ability to run there. F you can run round it younare in very good condition :) loved the scenery and location as well. Close to embankment and trafalgar square.||October 19, 2015
Telfordbeachlover||50||The weather was good and we really enjoyed a walk around the park visiting Kensington Palace and the Albert Memorial. A man we met told us to visit the Italian Gardens and we are glad we did. ||October 19, 2015
ClarkSamah||50||This is an amazing place for family fun. The swans, ducks and birds are plenty and love to be fed so bring some bread crumbs. The garden chairs there are for rent for 10 mins so bring your own beach chair instead. ||October 19, 2015
Colm54321||50||Took a few hours raoming Hyde park and kensington palace gardens recently.Hyde park is a great place to spend a nice sunny day.Beautiful lake, nice walks, and well presented gardens.The Italian gardens are awesome as are the water features.||October 19, 2015
Hammilly||50||Hyde Park is one of the most famous Royal Parks and thus has a great deal to live up to. Visit this amazing space and I'm sure you will not be disappointed. There really is so much to see and do this review can not do it complete justice rather detail what we saw and did and how we enjoyed ourselves. The things we have not reviewed are our extra motivation to visit again so perhaps all in all a very good thing. Just like the park itself!We had a family day out with plans to enjoy exercise, cycling (our daughter) and scooting (our younger son). Parking in one of the busy car-parks was a little time consuming as it is a very busy park but due to its sheer size a good investment of time and monies as by the time we returned we were pretty tired and given the park is free, the car park fees are a small price to pay when you add everything up.We set off to walk from the centre of the park to the playground at the far north westerly point. This allowed us to stroll through some stunning fauna and flora, past the beautiful Long Water, Serpentine, Diana Princess of Wales memorial pool and Italian fountains. All delightful and worth stop offs and/or visits in their own rights. In such a busy and densely populated and to a degree of course polluted London it is amazing to find such space, fresh air and relative quietness so close to the heart of the Great Wen. This and our exercise immediately made us feel a little healthier and a lot hungrier! On arrival at the play park after a not inconsiderable trek we were met with an absolutely stunning play area for children up to around 11 years or so. A climbing frame Pirate Ship which was stunning in design, a wigwam camp, several rock pools and sandpits not to mention the usual array of climbing frames, slides and swings. The children loved it. NB you may have to queue a little while but this is a small price to pay for not having to pay!, and well worth any wait. It also stops the volume of visitors being too much. The children loved it and there is a decent amount of refreshments and choice of available for us grown-ups nearby.Walking back over we chose not to visit the adjacent Pennington Palace (on another day we will though!) but stopped off at the Serpentine Gallery and Sackler Galleries which offered amazing free entry exhibitions in delightful surroundings. Well worth stopping off at for a dose of culture and caffine. Finally we visited the Diana Princess of Wales memorial water feature.It was awash with paddling, laughing, gamboling children having an absolute ball putting their feet in the water and joining the perpetual trail of fellow paddlers walking round and round the feature. We felt given her motherly love of all children that the memorial was both fitting and tasteful. It was delightful final stop off point for us in an amazingly enjoyable day.||October 19, 2015
Leonj59||50||Hyde Park is beautiful. Watching the squirrels, feeding the birds, just lying down on the grass, people watching. The place is huge so you need to keep track of where you get in or you will end up at the other end. ||October 19, 2015
P-M-Kira||30||It is a nice really big green garden. Nice to walk throzgh. The signs are really bad. We could not fine any of the things on it. ||October 18, 2015

M Saeed K||50||Hyde park is a huge park in the heart of London. It is a beautiful park with the beautiful serpentine lake with ducks swimming in it. The park is very popular with the people for walks and excersize. Some people come here to deliver speeches to the people who gather around to listen. A must visit||October 18, 2015
metahanindita||50||I think its the most beautiful (and huge) park that i've ever been. You can walk around, or sit by the park, ride your bicycle, anythin! Its my fave park!||October 18, 2015

kris_sl_nenkova||50||Very big and nice park. Perfect place to send some time under the sun (when there is some). Bring some nut with you and you will really enjoy feeding squirrels :)||October 18, 2015
NTXTravelBug60||40||This was beautiful in October...My husband was keen to see Speakers Corner. It was interesting but not quite as much information there as we might have thought. But a very nice park.||October 18, 2015
dew_76||50||Beautiful park. I've been there to hang out with friends (surprisely, the was a Stevie Wonder concert going on that evening as well, so we got to hear the concert. Lovely place to chill and relax, bike ride etc.||October 18, 2015
NOMADIC2014||40||I am a frequent traveller to London (about 4 times a year). On each visit, walking through the Royal parks is one of my most pleasant experiences.It is a treat for the senses to walk through these parks - fresh air, fragrant , beautiful and peaceful. I particularly enjoy Hyde Park for its variety. There is a lake full of ducks, geese…..who feel entitiled to have a snack from every passerby. It is particularly entertaining to watch their antics around young kids. On a sunny day the park is full of joggers, walkers, cyclists, skateboarders, dog walkers…….and even horse riders. There are a variety of trees, shrubs, flowering plants and manicured lawns. One can sit on the grass, wooden chairs, benches or duck into a cafe for a quick bite.During each season, winter, summer, autumn and spring the park takes on a different look & feel. During spring the colour bursts are particularly captivating. Hundreds of flowers spread throughout the park……well presented, well tended.||October 18, 2015
Diane C||40||What a gorgeous park. We hired a bike for £2 and if you haven't ridden for a long time this is plenty of time because the old bottom can't take much more than that!!! Lots of cute squirrels who are use to humans so take a few grapes and they will take them out of your hand for a great photo. Palace is amazing but is super busy. Nice coffee shop that we had coffee in but we also took our own lunch and sat by the lake to eat it which even though it was a bit chilly it was fantastic none the less. We hired out a chair £1.65 for an hour and sat for about 30min to break the riding up. There are a lot of places you cannot ride to/on so go for your ride and then you can revisit those places by foot. Hyde Park is a must visit spot.||October 17, 2015
Irishspirit1972||50||I love parks, and seeing this one was no exception. I went to see the Peter Pan statue and realized how big it really is. It was right across the street from my hotel so it was easy to access for me but it's also a very popular park in London.||October 17, 2015
Rob D||50||A wonderful place to walk on a fine day in the heart of such a busy city as London. The park is beautifully maintained and really pleasurable for a stroll. Never to be missed is Speakers Corner on a Sunday. A breath of fresh air in the heart of the hustle and bustle. ||October 17, 2015
LazyLauraMaisey||50||What is there that Hyde Park does not have? I run here, I swim here, I cycle here, I have slept here on sunny days, I watch horses, I watch dogs, I watch people. The park is steeped in history, political and regal. Many important things that have happened in the past few hundred years have been in or near here. A few minutes in Hyde Park sets my mind at ease and reminds me what a wonderful place London is.||October 17, 2015
JayneTrip||50||If it's a nice day, there is nothing like a walk through Hyde Park and you should definitely see Speaker's Corner on a weekend since there are usually 8-12 soap box speakers on a variety of subjects and you can just listen or join in and debate.||October 17, 2015

69Traveltraveltravel||40||Vast park for a run, saw a beautiful sun-rise last Sunday. You could go for a nice zig-zag run through the park for hours. If I were there for a walk, I would appreciate more benches and maybe a couple of play-grounds for kids. Must be great to lie in the park's desk-chairs when it it nice weather.||October 17, 2015

Terence M||50||We were staying at a Military Club near Marble Arch so it was just a stroll across Oxford Street to Hyde Park, it was nice when we started but ending up drizzle but who cares we were on holiday and in London lots of flowers and trees plenty of bird life on the Serpentine especially White Swans and Canadian Geese lots of them! it is very popular for exercise running etc if you feel like it (after a day up and down Oxford Street No!) it was lovely to just walk in the fresh air and smell the flowers.||October 17, 2015
David K||50||We had a delightful time in the park. With a delicious picnic lunch from the Food Hall in Harrods waiting to be eaten and the sun shining overhead, two hours flew by. There is such much to see. A free map is available at the Information Centre just outside the Hyde Park Tube Station. Enjoy!It would be a great place to let kids run and run and run. The playgrounds are good as are the boats for hire. There is also the statue of Peter Pan and the Princess Diana Memoral. Again, enjoy!||October 16, 2015
paula a||50||All my teenagers wanted to do. Was lay in the park!! Then they disappeared and went to the Beer Garden. They were 18. They are legal in Europe:) Pleasant place to stroll. Get a break from Hustle of the City.||October 16, 2015
Ali A||50||I go there to see all the children feeding the ducks at the pond, the warm coffee on a cold day at The Serpentine Cafe at the pond. A beautiful stroll with the kids. You'd love it and they would too.||October 16, 2015
pratiti||40||This is a vast park, bigger than St. James Park. It also houses the Kensington Palace. The park is vast & beautiful. It also has the Albert Memorial Hall, a vast lake in front of the Kendington Palace. Loved the park. Iconic. ||October 16, 2015
riddhi_j88||40||Hyde park is an oasis of calm in the otherwise bustling City of London. It offers acres and acres of soothing green open space for cycling, walking and sports. Just being here can calm you ! Loved it !!||October 15, 2015
slumberdayz||50||Hyde Park was on our tick list to see whilst in UK on holidays. The park is clean and looked after well, just watch out to not walk in the bicycle path ways as the riders do zoom through the park. We walked through the park to catch our open top bus through to other parts of London. All bus companies stop at the Marble Arch end of the park. Well worth a visit.. ||October 15, 2015
Geo-Cooks||50||A lovely park, many interesting walks to be had. Central to London and near Bayswater. Some interesting characters to be seen too!||October 15, 2015
Ascolovesla||50||I love the public speakings every sunday in the park. Very interesting to hear people speaking on subjects they believe in, and such an interesting opportunity to observe with a sandwhich and drink in hand. Loved the beautiful park memorial for Princess Diana, also the live music concerts throughout the year. You can rent peddle boats, a really fun activity to do when the weather is good.||October 15, 2015
SmithyAberdeen||50||We travelled down to London for a long weekend.My wife booked a great hotel across from Hyde Park. The weather was so good that once we dumped our case in we headed for the park.We had a great stroll round and stopped off for a coffee at the Lido Café on the way round.Beautiful. ||October 15, 2015
WaltonReviews||40||Great place for a quiet walk on a Sunday morning. Well used by the public for jogging and cycling and a good place to people watch over a nice coffee.||October 15, 2015
cragglerock||40||LIke all City parks, it can get very busy with people rushing about trying to relax. Watch out for the skaters, joggers, bikers, street hockey and martial arts types. Very nice though.||October 15, 2015
Jaerbu||50||Large park space well kept in London. Try a rented bike which does not cost much, to reach fast over a large area. Marked bike lanes||October 15, 2015
177MarkG177||40||We were staying right along the northside of Hyde Park at the Lancaster Terrace, and ventured in and around the park on a beautiful sunny day. A great place to strech ones legs, get some mild exercise, while enjoying nature. Wanted to hear people at Speaker's Corner, but no one was speaking...too bad. Overall, a beautiful park. ||October 15, 2015
MaryBethJ_65||50||Hyde Park offers something for everyone. You can stroll and enjoy the sites, feed the ducks if you feel like it, sit on a (rented) lawn chair and people watch, run the various paths and breathe the fresh air, or just wander. So peaceful and beautiful!||October 14, 2015
Adnan B||50||If you are looking for relaxation and a smell of fresh air, Hyde Park is the ideal place! Beautiful Park! I love it!||October 14, 2015

Gedsbird||50||When visiting London this is a must see. Stunning gardens, beautiful architecture and lovely building. A tranquil place to spend a few hours in the heart of London. ||October 14, 2015
Jan_Robert_P||40||Went for a nice, calm run in Hyde Park. Pleasent surprise. Not too crowded, but still plenty to see. Quite nice with the little lake, lots of animals/wildlife, people strolling, tourists wandering... and other runners. Lots of asphalt, but also paths just outside the road if you really want to avoid the asphalt. A lot better to run here than along the streets of "downtown" London!||October 14, 2015
stinkanor||50||My hotel was near here, so I found myself wandering when I had some free time. This is a beautiful, and well used park and a great place to visit. It is a lovely break from the cars and congestion in London.||October 14, 2015
Trista C||50||Everything is so beautiful there, swans, trees, lawns, lakes, everything. Suitable for friends, families, and couples. Autumn is the best time to visit. ||October 14, 2015
sirgaralad||50||It's London but it's the best bit. No finer place than Hyde Park, especially early morning, watch the sunrise and make sure your camera is fully charged. Check out the weather the night before, sadly on my visit this month,the morning was cloudy, so attached is a photofrom my last visit.||October 14, 2015
sunilpmone||50||Luckily we stayed just across the road.This huge forest , garden lake, park is in the centre of city.Just difficult to believe.Huge one to roam.Full of all the attractions that a garden can have.Do do visit when there at London.||October 14, 2015
nancy m||50||I love open places. Dont miss it on a sunny day. You have ur snack ,have a walk .Feed the ducks and the goes as well as pigeons. You enjoy the walk. Lovely place||October 14, 2015
Alexclondon95||50||Hyde Park must be by far my favourite park in London! It's huge and lovely! It feels like you're crossing threw nature :) One of the things you should do is either sitting by the Serpentine or rent one of those paddle things ;)||October 14, 2015
dcmou||50||Take a stroll or jog through Hyde Park! I remember the first time I visited Hyde Park... 1978! I didn't know they charged a fee to sit in the chairs around the Serpentine Lake. But take some coins (pounds as I don't know what it costs now) with you as it is so fabulous to relax by Serpentine Lake and bird, people and dog watch! The park itself is vibrant and active with joggers and strollers and animals and it's just a wonderful day outside. At certain times of the year there will be a Christmas market at the corner of Hyde Park. Look for special events such as this depending on what time of the year you are visiting.||October 13, 2015
Mrs_Pilpelet||50||This is a great park with a relaxing atmosphere, easy to reach with the tube. There's a lake with many ducks, swans and other animals. There are plenty of benches to sit on, beautiful fountains. I enjoyed my visit very much. It cost 20p to use the bathroom, but they were clean and well-maintained. There's a gallery inside the park and a cafe.||October 13, 2015
paulinanignol19||50||Beautiful ParkI recommend to do a picnic here, perfect to relax after a shopping or museum day! Also very good for a romantic and fun date||October 13, 2015
756justinc||50||This park is very large and there is much to see from monuments, fountains and flower gardens. In addition, being a dog lover, it is great to see how dog friendly the City of London is!||October 13, 2015
Laura O||50||Had an amazing time walking through the park with my boyfriend. Lovely to sit, enjoy the and take amazing photos.||October 13, 2015
meezer3||50||Great place to stop in to relax and distress from the hustle and bustle of London's energy. Beautiful lake filled with assorted waterfowl. Nice Pavilion to eat at with outside tables and chairs. Wide paths to either stroll down or ride a bike on. Perfect place to watch the sun set..||October 13, 2015
ScottEngering||50||Having seen the Albert Memorial close up for the very first time, after a visit to the Natural History Museum, I decided to make the very most of a lovely sunny Saturday afternoon and take a walk in Hyde Park - another place that I barely knew.My original plan was to visit the Serpentine Gallery but, finding that the next exhibition was not yet ready to view - as I also found to be the situation at the Sackler Gallery - I just crossed back over Serpentine Bridge to see the Isis sculpture on the south side of the Serpentine and followed various path until I finally reached the Queen Elizabeth Gates.In my early days as a photographer, the National Monuments Record took a like to my eye for architectural detail and I was encouraged to photograph examples of good post-war architectural sculpture, as well as war memorials and a variety of other monuments and public art and sculpture.At Hyde Park, there was something to catch my eye wherever I went and I felt in my element! I spent a fraction under an hour there, and didn't actually take many photos because I still had the Wellington Monument etc to see, but it would be easy to spend a whole day or more exploring this wonderful place, with a good map.||October 13, 2015
Aditya B||50||Brilliant place for morning walks, to exercise, to play some tennis and remain fit.. can be visited anytime of the day...||October 13, 2015
WBronkhorst||40||Traveling thru London with the constant hustle and bustle, this is so relaxing to just have a stroll thru this beautiful park, especially if you have good weather.||October 12, 2015
Alyssa L||50||Walking through Hyde Park is my favourite thing to do in London on the weekends. I used to walk from Notting Hill Market down to Hyde Park and it was a lovely walk down the lane with all the ambassadors houses. ||October 12, 2015
Shere M||40||Gorgeous park. One of the most beautiful I think I have been to. The terrain is flat so it's a low impact activity with a huge payoff. There is a big lake where you can rent a peddle boat, you can people watch to your heart's content, and explore the neighbourhoods around the park. ||October 12, 2015
robmU6156XY||40||This is a huge park area which TRIES to limit bike access making for good strolling. The park is used by adjacent dog owners which sadly often chase birds and squirrels as they are mostly off lead and unsupervised.||October 11, 2015
Mpmav1||50||What a wonderful park. Green, beautiful, welcoming and clean. Would be happy to come back next time in town.||October 11, 2015
Otteraswas||50||From Speaker's Corner to the Serpentine Hyde Park is a pleasure to stroll through as an alternative to taking the Underground to get around London. Plenty of seats, trees, grassy area, riders in Rotten Row. Might not be quite so idyllic in pouring rain.||October 11, 2015
pearlfisher123||40||Whether on your own or with family/friends this is a great place to relax and unwind away from the crowds. There is a nice café by the lake but we bought ice creams and strolled around the lakeside where you can watch or feed the ducks and swans. Grab a deckchair and rest your feet or, if you can plan in advance, take a picnic and spend several hours. Warning - watch out for cyclists and segways :-)||October 11, 2015
annette c||40||An excellent place to get away from the shops and nearer to nature right in the heart of the city. Pathways etc clearly sign posted which make it an easy and pleasant way to walk from Paddington to Hyde Park Corner and Knightsbridge. Very pleasant cafe overlooking the Serpentine and the possibility of hiring a deckchair if you want to just sit back and enjoy the view!||October 11, 2015
Belemoih||40||Very short visit. Great to relax and see greenery to escape from bustling city. Recommended for family for picnicking. ||October 10, 2015
MJL56||40||This was not my first trip to London but it was my first visit to Hyde Park. I had been looking forward to seeing the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain and it was more lovely than I imagined. The Hyde Park gardens and walkways were beautiful and clean and even though there were many other visitors I felt as though it was not crowded at all and nice and quiet.||October 10, 2015
Agn_Gru||40||For me every single park is fantastic. And so is Hyde Park. Great place for a walk, coffee, chill out by the lake.||October 10, 2015
sophia27||40||Lovely large park. Great for walking, cycling and running or just to sit in one of the cafes and enjoy coffee next to the Serpentine. Lots of take-away cafes as well as the big restaurants. Nice to be able to getaway from the busy surrounding areas.||October 10, 2015
Grace D||50||I love this park. With swan and other cute animals, is the peace of the mind.A must-see of a London tour||October 10, 2015
vinhfromtoronto||30||It's a big park. There are some gardens on the south end and some monuments. It's not particularly pretty in October.||October 10, 2015
Phyllis H||50||We stayed on the north side of Hyde Park. It has beautiful grounds and trails which you can walk or bike on. Kensington Palace is at one end. There are benches and a few snack bar type concessions.||October 9, 2015
Jenna W||50||Hyde Park is beautiful from start to finish. Great for getting away from the hustle and bustle of central London. Lovely in the summer to go on the peddle boat around the serpentine and a perfect setting to a crisp winters walk.||October 9, 2015
evadora1||50||Beautiful place to visit on a sunny, weekend day, as we did on our trip to London. Take a deck chair , relax and get this special atmosphere close to the nature in the city center.||October 9, 2015
scottishlobos||50||Great park and a great escape from all the hustle and bustle of the city. Very relaxing watching the world go by nice to see all the animals that run around. Excellent location as well. Good way to spend an afternoon.||October 8, 2015
135alanb||50||It's big. If you're a runner, then run. 3-4 miles around and lots of company. Otherwise just wonder. Lovely on a sunny day when everyone's skiving off work and looking happy||October 8, 2015
IneedaRoadscoller||50||We walked through Hyde Park on our way from Buckingham Palace to the V&A museum. We had a sit down in the rose gardens (DO stop & smell!) in the South East corner (Keep your eyes out for the parrots! Yes, Parrots!) before meandering around the Southern side of the Serpentine. It was near the end of this path that we discovered the Diana Memorial Fountain where one is encouraged to: "Please feel free to sit on the edge of the Memorial and refresh your feet". My boyfriend had incredibly sore feet from 3 days of walking London, so off with his socks and shoes and in the fountain for 1/2 an hour. His feet felt great for the next 4 hours or so & he will forever be grateful to the People's Princess!||October 8, 2015
bk_essence||50||This is a large and beautiful park in the middle of crazy city. The rose garden is lovely with variety of flowers. Nice walking and biking paths throughout the park Plenty of spots to sit and relax to enjoy nature and peace.||October 7, 2015
Weinmann11||50||While in London, I never miss an opportunity to get a run in Hyde Park. Cold, hot, rain or shine - the park is always a great place to run. There are countless ways to go; things to see; and people to watch to keep your mind off the physical run. ||October 7, 2015
Atavic_Prince||50||I was in London for the holidays, in South Kensington, and it simply happened I decided to spend my afternoon in Hyde park, with friends and relatives. Needless to say, the park is huge, beautiful, well organised and amazingly decorated. There are two different artificial lakes one of them is with Swans and ducks, the other is huge and beautiful. There are various pathways, some with flowers which are ideal for a walk, and some other perfect for a good footing section. The park is full of monuments, including a beautiful mausoleum, a free gallery were to spend a very relaxing day away from the noise and the stressful London day life. I am sure I will be back there.||October 7, 2015
JPHStVincent||50||Peace and quiet in the centre of the city. Astonishingly large (when you add in Kensington Gardens) with everything from statuary to wild meadows.||October 7, 2015

NerjaFan1159||50||One of the most beautiful places in London! I used to work opposite and walked or cycled here most days. An oasis of tranquility in one of the World's busiest cities.||October 6, 2015
mstf_ammar||50||a relax and beautiful park, i had few hours to explore it, and definitely i will pass again and use a boat in the lake, running through the park, cycling and read while setting beside the lake. i impressed with the landscape||October 6, 2015
turbinux||50||Pretty relaxing, there are different things to do in the park, you can look at the river, chase the swans, there are some monuments and the serpentine gallery. very alive and very good for jogging.||October 6, 2015
dominicb1968||50||Walk just 50 meters from Oxford Street or Marble Arch and you enter a different, timeless world. Without doubt, Hyde Park is London's greatest unsung attraction. Towards the Marble Arch end, on any summer's day, you will be surrounded by people chilling, having a picnic, talking, walking, or playing ball. They will be from every far flung corner of this planet.Walk deeper into the park, along and of the many paths and you will discover little pavilions, streams and gardens.The park is best in summer when the trees that surround it are in full bloom. Then the sounds of the city are totally stifled and absorbed and the park takes on a majestic other-world feel. It also becomes timeless. Building restrictons prevent the construction of new buildings that overlook the park. I don't agree with these, but it has the effect of transporting the space from something urban into something rural.Check out the fountains that are opposite Lancaster Gate tube. From NottingHill follow the path that leads to the Royal Albert hall, and there's another that goes to Knightsbridge.On Sunday follow the Serpentine (an artificial lake) and enjoy the Swans, joggers, and pretty young things out for a stroll.You'll also find the Serpentine Gallery on the cross from from Lancaster Gate to KnightsBridge. Check out the exhibits. They are world class (fees often apply).Whether or sad and love-lost or king, or queen, of the world, there will be something magical to transport you to a different place.And if you have an opinion or two, there's always Speakers Corner. Here you'll hear every subject under the son debated with skill, passion and the kind of linguistic dexterity that will leave you aghast or giggling. No hate alllowed.||October 6, 2015
hajerimf||40||It is just nice to sit and relax . The park is so beautiful. Not only kids will enjoy it, if you have kids, but also adults will do. Many activities can be performed in the park.||October 6, 2015
vinmin||50||When visiting London, if the day is nice and sunny the best place to people watch and walk from speakers corner to the lovely italian gardens and then as you carry on reaching the Princess Diana memorial. You can easily spend the day there with a picnic.||October 6, 2015
MirandaClare||40||Walking at Hyde park makes you feel at easy i felt relaxed and loved seeing all that the local nature had to offer. Saw a few swans which was nice. The walking tracks are easy. ||October 5, 2015
RebeccaUofI||50||We spend half a day walking through Hyde Park. Fabulous! Over the Serpentine (also lovely at night), past the Peter Pan statue (a must) and down to Kensington Palace. And on Sundays, artists sell their paintings along the railing near Lancaster Gate.||October 5, 2015
Sergio S||50||Stunningly beautiful park to take a walk through. There are large sections of grass with people lounging or playing soccer, paths with people biking and rollerblading through, gardens to walk around, a river full of ducks and swans, and even a little cafe near the Princess Diana memorial to sit and enjoy the gorgeous view.||October 5, 2015
GemmaAlbenga||50||This park is huge and beautiful. It's wonderful to stroll near the lake where there is a multitude of wildlife. The birds actually come out of the water and surround you for food. A lot of people fed them. If you want you can hire a small boat and go around the lake. In this park there are many types of trees and flowers. Stop at the restaurant right on the lake. You can eat or just have a drink. The price is good and if the weather's nice it's wonderful.||October 5, 2015
Leah A||40||A great big park, with lots going on in and around it for explore. hyde park is perfect to explore on a sunny day in london with friends.||October 5, 2015

jrnewson||50||Both Hyde park and regents park are well worth a visit depending on how much time you have in London. We say the queens horse guards training in Hyde park which was fantastic, they have a small circular area where they have a small circulate area where they practice.||October 5, 2015
Saintlysinner||40||There's something exciting about having a massive green space in the middle of a hustling and bustling city. I truly love wondering around Hyde Park escaping the noise from the London traffic. It's for everyone be it a romantic stroll for couples, a family day out, a solo jog (or pondering) and picnics for friends. ||October 5, 2015
Paulyne V||40||We walked for three hours on a bright sunny morning. There is a beautiful Italian water garden and also the fountain dedacated to princess Di. Huge trees birds, flowers etc ... You can also combine your visit in this park with Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace.||October 4, 2015
Travelmom29||50||Very much like Central Park in New York, London's Hyde Park is a must when visiting "when it's green". Easily walkable from Paddington Station and other tube stations. Sort of connected to Kensington Gardens, do not miss Princess Diana's Memorial Fountain. ||October 4, 2015
Brian C||50||Wonderful green space located close to main sightseeing attractions. Good for picnics or a quiet stroll to escape the hustle and bustle. Large walking paths and bike rentals are available throughout the park. Great way to see locals enjoying their energetic city.||October 4, 2015
RannJ||30||You could tell it hadn't rained much in London. The grass almost everywhere was crunchy dry and brittle. Still a great walk in a famous attraction.||October 4, 2015
314travelista||50||We traveled to London for the first time and our stop to Hyde Park was just what we needed to let the kids expend their energy and for a slower pace for adults. The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground is a must see while here.||October 4, 2015
Maria S||30||Nice but less than what I expected. Not so well mainteined. Anyhow the view of Kensington is nice and the coulours in autumn rounds a good park for a rest.||October 4, 2015
suemarb||50||Really lovely open space in one of the busiest parts of London. Boating on the Serpentine and great cafe.||October 4, 2015

Talotunisi||50||I can't think where to go in London when I was a child but the Hyde Park, I ride my bike there, feed the duck or goose, eat ice cream and relax there.||October 3, 2015

Incredible_Hemang||50||Its an amazing green space in the heart of London, the restaurant is called Serpentine Bar & Kitchen (I think) and the food is very good. Hyde Park itself has great walking paths and cycle trail too. I had seen some horse riders on the mud track too. All in all a great place to laze around or enjoy some outdoor sports. ||October 3, 2015
Marcelo P||40||Hyde Park is a single Park as any one other. There is nothing special on it beside the fancy name. I am not stating it is not a place to go. But do expect to find an another world Park. ||October 3, 2015
wrlang||50||We stayed at a hotel near Hyde Park and went through the park several times on our way site seeing. The park is large and has numerous paths that can take you through the gardens and just off into secluded areas away from the bustle of the city. Kennsington Palace/gardens adjoins the park as well as several other monuments. There were always lots of people in the park many just picnicking or laying on the grass enjoying the day. There are benches along the major paths but they are not plentiful.||October 2, 2015
robbieranga||50||A lovely open garden in London, Hyde Park is simply superb.With enough space for a lot of people to sit back, relax and sun themselves, Hyde Park is a nice location to simply walk around on a sunny day, doing nothing in particular but sunning themselves.Highlights for me were the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain and the hire boats on the Serpentine- hard work, but fun!||October 2, 2015
Sharon M||50||Beautiful park With a Lovely Pound all Kinds of ducks & birds for all to see ideal for a picnic a must see when in the Capital ||October 2, 2015

Ian-Down-Under||50||Everyone says it's worth a walk around Hyde Park. It is. Plenty to observe and enjoy without any planning. Kids love the playground areas as well as most sections of grass being fully accessible. Many of the trees are ginormous, great place. And it's free.||September 30, 2015
JDMiller_7||30||If you want to walk around more than you've already walked around seeing the city, this is a great place. I don't live in a busy city, so I suppose I'm not as impressed by open land areas as people who live in busy cities. It was beautiful. It was nice to sit and take in the view. But, it's just a park. ||September 30, 2015
Squeezemop||50||Absolutely beautiful park, and there are a few things you can do there and see there.

PatylK||50||Hyde Park is my favorite park/ place to get away from everyone. i always get a Pret a Manger sandwich and items to go and sit and eat peacefully. The place is amazing for photographers as one can spend hours walking and snapping pictures. I never get bored. Stroll down the Serpentine and have lunch at the bar. You will always want to come back to Hyde Park and lose yourself to nature! Trust me!!!||September 30, 2015
micheled849||50||A friend and I went for early morning walks in the park as a start to the day. We loved seeing the horse guards and other equestrians and their mounts out for their morning walks. Lots of joggers, walkers, cyclists, dogs and my favourite, cheeky squirrels, were enjoying the morning, the gardens and the greenery as well.||September 30, 2015
Spidey513||50||Its a nice place to pass some relaxing time with your family while in London! Had a great tie with friends there||September 29, 2015

khalid0211||50||Hyde Park is right in the centre of London. One of the peculiar places is the Speakers corner...it's entertaining to listen to some of the eccentric speakers. You can get a puddle boat and go around the lake. Attend and out door concert. Or grab snacks in the restaurant on the lake. If you plan to sit on the beach chairs male sure you have small change to pay the staff. And when you are done walk to the Marble Arch.||September 29, 2015
AmrichArjun||50||The most amazing park in the world. Please go to Hyde Park. Its massive, green, beautiful and full of life. I have spent a few days there just walking, sitting, eating, feeding the birds and generally hanging out||September 29, 2015
VirginiaSuntop||50||This is a beautiful park and the best way to see it is on a bicycle. I had a couple of hours to spare before I had to catch a plane and decided this to see Hyde Park because I had never been there. I rented one of the red bicycles that are located near the entrances throughout the park. It allowed me to see all the sights in the short time I had for less than $10.00.||September 29, 2015
lisadkm||50||this park is beautiful,clean and a pleasure to walk around.....wildlife in abundance and people enjoying the pleasant surroundings.england at its best..the statues and architecture are awesome and well preserved||September 28, 2015
Luke T||50||Our hotel was very close to the Park. It was beautiful to see the park in person, plus I remember hearing about the Park as a young man. It is a calm area in a busy city. Great to sit and just dream of a quieter time. ||September 28, 2015
Shaikhan A||50||This place can explain what the word " LIFE " means!! The people, views, ice creams, just relaxing and having fun there, + it's huge for those who like to make some sporty activities ||September 28, 2015
Steve O||40||Well organised and policed. Very surprised to find that beer prices inside were not at all rip off. You can pay more in pubs outside the venue. Queues for toilets (mens) were never too long and an in/ out system employed. Tip: if travelling by tube don't be fooled into walking to Bond St Instead of Marble Arch.||September 28, 2015
aboelazm||50||Best place to hang out alone or with family or friends. On a sunny day, I take my lunch and sit on the grass there to enjoy it. You can walk or rent a bike. I love going there and I never get bored.||September 28, 2015
RebMur||50||really pretty park with a great atmosphere right by the hub of the city. Love seeing all the birds and animals ||September 28, 2015
rakeshkhanna14||50||One could spend an entire day and yet not see enough of this park. A great place to picnic and have your walk/jog. Don't miss out the "free speech" corner, its great fun.||September 27, 2015
Julie890||50||First time I have been to Hyde Park and my 12 year old daughter and I ate here for lunch. We had the Woodfire Pizza and it was delicious. We definitely look forward to visiting again during our next visit to London||September 27, 2015
conorsavage||50||Walk, run or stroll - this is my favouite park in London. Go rent a paddle boat and spend an hour just letting the current lightly take you through the lake and take a moment to enjoy the peace in the middle of London||September 27, 2015
PowerLounger||40||This park is beautiful. There are many walking lanes to choose from, and many areas for couples or families to sit and enjoy an afternoon.There a chairs for rent that allow you to sit and look at the pretty lake, there are concessions and bathrooms, and even paddle boats for rent. On the West side of the lake is a memorial to Lady Diana, and at the West end of the park is Kensington Palace, well worth the visit if you like to see about 20 rooms set up as they were, with costumed mannequins giving the rooms a nice flavor.||September 27, 2015
JacquelineInstone||50||Whenever we come to London, we definitely will drop by Hyde park for a run or sometimes even just a stroll in the park! The park is lovely, and gives you the sense of escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. We think this is one of the most beautiful park in the world!Definitely a must visit for all seasons!||September 27, 2015
AmirMohsen32||40||When the sun shines, this is one of my favourite places in London. Take your family for a relaxing day and enjoy the park. ||September 27, 2015
LikeToTravel3388||40||Beautiful park in the city. You can have a nice calm stroll through the park especially during autumn, with a warm coffee Little kids are free to run around chase after the pigeons, geese or ducks. There are also swans in the lake.You can take bus 73 to King's Cross of its vicinity. There are many other buses.||September 27, 2015
QuietmanTravels||50||Spent most of the day walking through Hyde Park taking in the sites. Multiple gardens, water parks, the Princess Di memorial, eating, paddle boats, wildlife, etc. What a great way to spend a day outdoors. There is a circular pathway to walk and multiple spurs from that pathway. I was solo and had a great time taking in the sites and leisurely walking the grounds. Saw families taking a stroll, joggers, swimming at the beach, bicycle riders, etc. Coming back soon and plan to take another stroll through the park.||September 26, 2015
GentlemanTravel||50||This park is always lovely! It is vast, and a perfect opportunity to get away from the noise and stress that the London metropolis so often provides.I think the park is well kept. A wonderful place to have a pick nick. So, a hamper can be well worth the expense.Hyde Park is connected with Kensington Gardens, which is also worth a visit.||September 26, 2015
BigRuss1213||30||We walked through this park on several occasions it was on the way to Buckingham palace. It was well used by all sorts, people jogging, walking, horse riding, etc. a little busy. ||September 26, 2015
David C||50||There is nothing I can say that can better the experience of at least a half a day taking in Hyde Park as there is so much to do, see or try, such as hiring a bike to get around the park and see all there monuments, the boating pond, Kensington Palace, perhaps a bit of rowing on the Serpentine followed by an ice cream and just sitting on the grass. For me, in the right weather time in the park is better than a visit to the museums or shops.||September 26, 2015
JonJ785||40||a great place to get away from all of the hussle of London without actually going very far, a great place to just sit, relax have a coffee and watch the world go by before you re-enter the throng of London||September 26, 2015
Matthew_and_Maria||50||London has many lovely parks, but this is one of the best. We spent a couple of hours strolling around the Serpentine looking at all the beautiful birds in the heart of a bustling metropolis.||September 26, 2015
OMP1985||50||Hyde park is a beautifully conserved park where to go with friends, to have a romantic walk with your partner or to do some jogging.||September 26, 2015
Rchie63||40||We strolled through both Hyde Park and Kensignton Gardens on a Sunday afternoon. I was delighted to see the ponds, birds, feeding squirrels right out of my hand. It was clean, the ice cream was yummy and the other people were having a terrific day. ||September 25, 2015
legsbell||50||This is a beautiful and very large park. The lake and beautiful swans and other birds are a relaxing plan to grab a bite. There is so much to see, but my favorite was the Peter Pan statue. ||September 25, 2015

1272anne||40||LARGE park with different trees and flowers - loved the swans and just chilling the sunshine watching people strolling by - away from the hustle and bustle of the city||September 24, 2015
raoulhood||40||Undoubtedly the myth of Hyde Park in London gets a justified reason with a visit (especially if done on a sunny day): full of people in perfect relax, the joyous brigades of children, in a compendium of trees and meadows just "'English "with a twist of a dozen kilometers of trails, only foot traffic and dirt paths, benches. It should be added a significant distribution of impotanti landmarks, monuments, Italian gardens, fountains and trees.There is also a plaque hidden by a bank of forsythia is dedicated to the filing of the new botanical variety that just was given the surname of the botanist Mr William Forsyth 1737-1804 (see my photo).||September 24, 2015
Don49680||50||Our hotel Thistle Marble Arch was only a few blocks from the eastern end of Hyde Park so we walked some of this park each day during our visit to London. The park is huge with many walking and biking pathways and it is a popular spot with London locals on Sunday's. ||September 23, 2015
susis123||50||Hyde Park is HUGE! There were so many different floras that you could find, enjoy and/or take photograph of. My favourite is the swan lake... Beautiful! ||September 23, 2015
Stewart S||30||Last time I was here was 40 years ago. It sure has changed! Not as peaceful as it used to be. many people, although it was a holiday weekend. Was interesting to drive through it. ||September 23, 2015
ColindeBain241||40||We came in to the park through the Achilles Statue entrance. Immediately the hustle and energy of a major world capital closed behind us as we walked the paved paths of this park. A great spot to people watch. A great spot to look at well manicured nature- even the swans seem to be strategically placed for maximum effect. The Princess Diana fountain is a real treat as well.||September 23, 2015
Dr_Ramadan||50||I went there to see what every body is talking about it. It is the widest park in Europe. Very wide and very green, you feel as if you in another world. People are sitting, lying, running, walking and in all conditions enjoying. I went to the spoke corner to see protestors but unfortunately, no protestors at that day. ||September 22, 2015
Christabel90||50||One of the big parks in London where you can just chill and enjoy the peace. There are plenty of dogs, people and yet plenty of space for everyone.||September 22, 2015
raez52||50||Always amazes me this park within a busy city beautifully kept lawns and gardens safe wide Walking paths also for the more fit pushbikes for rent a lovely walk from one side of the city to another..cafe and ice cream available well worth the effort||September 22, 2015
shadows830||50||Everyone needs an oasis when in a big city where they can go to get away for just a while to recharge ones batteries.To see the trees,walk on the grass,smell flowers,feed the swans….Or just sit on a park bench and unwind and do nothing. You can do all of the above in Hyde Park.||September 22, 2015

Sherry C||50||We arrived mid day to London and walked from our Knightsbridge hotel through the Albert Gate to discover delightful gardens, marvelous aged sycamores, a delightful cafe overlooking the pond and our newest favorite people watching place on earth.For families with children there are two wonderful, well-maintained fenced in playgrounds, ducks/swans and geese to delight the children, and joint-free walks (a bit rough but very manageable) for kickboarding elementary and preschoolers.The green and white striped lawnchairs are available for rent by the hour. Just claim yours and rest assured that someone will be around to collect a bit over a pound per chair.Delightful time, the Central Park of London.||September 21, 2015
Linda829||40||We had a beautiful London fall day and we walked from one end to the other via Speakers Corner. Really enjoyed the day. ||September 21, 2015

brookhou1||30||I love to stroll thru Hyde Park to the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain which itself is worth the walk for me...the rest of the park is 'huge'....sections can get crowded and there is plenty of 'Goose Grease' you can step in if you aren't careful, but it is a welcome respite from the busy streets nearby.||September 20, 2015
CountVanCount||40||It's a nice park to get away from the noise and, if you're lucky, the people. Contains some sights such as speakers corner, lake, etc etc. nice place to sit down and relax. ||September 20, 2015
ronkeke||50||There is so much to do in HYDE park, the museum, the cafes, the pond with ducks etc, the running tracks, there might even be a fair or concert. A versatile relaxation point in middle of the bustling London. It's also a short cut between kensington /Knightsbridge and bays water/ nottinghillgate and marble arch.||September 20, 2015
Blondebear2014||40||Visited in september. It is a large park, grass needing cut its bit shabby overall. There is a lot of squirrels, birds, swans and ducks. You can only cycle in certain bits of the park. Few sights to see, I think the italian fountains were the nicest attaction.||September 20, 2015
jaindough||40||We spent a great deal of time (in addition to having spent time in Kengington Gardens) here in Hyde park and very much enjoyed our time doing so. It's a great place to stretch out and have a picnic lunch in the shade on a hot summer day. It was easily accessible from our hotel.||September 20, 2015
phantidae||40||Hyde Park is a beautiful open space in the midst of a bustling metropolitan city. Walking through the park, you forget there is a city just outside the gates.||September 20, 2015
Rachael B||50||On a beautiful day in the centre of London this place it great for tranquillity ideal for families too great place for a picnic and feeding the wild life if you want to relax in the city centre this is the place to go||September 20, 2015
David P||50||Sunny Sunday afternoon, not been to Hyde park since I was 7 years old with my family when princess Diana married Prince Charles. This time was with my partner to walk off our Sunday dinner.It's beautiful, well looked after and a very popular place to just sit and enjoy it all, you can forget the fact you're in London in here, away from the traffic etc.||September 20, 2015
paulyfb||50||This is a nice place to go to get away from hustle and bustle of the city. Just to sit in sun and watch people going by. Nice walk around lake too. Can get real busy when sun gets out. Have a go on a boat ||September 20, 2015
615kaz||50||I loved Hyde Park, but I'm an outdoor kind of person. It's just amazing that they have all this space in the middle of London. It has such a nice feel about it .. Our plan for that day was Harrods, Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace .. All located close together.||September 20, 2015
1Norwegian||50||How come I've never reviewed it before? I have spent hours, days, long walks there over just so many years. This time a delayed bus made me decide rather to walk across it and up to Queensway from Kensington High, passing Kensington Palace as you walk up. The park is ALWAYS clean and well tended, and seeing those little squirrels scurry about is a special attraction. Come summer, I'll be on the lawns again!||September 20, 2015
melb4545||50||Hyde park is huge. You could easily spend hours here.A paradise for nature lovers! Make sure you have on your walking shoes when you go here. ||September 19, 2015
cherylmatt82||40||A beautiful, peaceful, well kept park. If you are in to sight seeing then walking through Hyde Park is a must.||September 19, 2015
YoavWorldWide||30||i strolled along the park and enjoyed the green grAss and beautiful flowers. So i sat down on one overlooking the pond but was asked to pay or leave. London cant afford a few chairs for the tourists?||September 19, 2015
Emma J||50||Perfect for early morning walk. Beautiful lake with swans geese and various wildlife. Perfect to get away from the bustle of busy city streets. Lots of walkways with people running, walking, cycling, horse riding, swimming and lazing about on deck chairs. ||September 18, 2015
Yuggibear||40||I walked from the top of the park all the way to the end. The park is really big and is also used for concerts and other events. Towards the bottom end of the park (closest to royal albert area) you will find the process diana memorial. The memorial has opening and closing times just outs the gate. ||September 18, 2015
justglance2015||50||A beautiful park,great place to walk,to get some outdoor feeling in the city.You can see lots og different birds and squirrels,great benches to sit on.Small stalls to buy food on.||September 18, 2015
mowden||40||A great place to sit and relax, feed the ducks, or wander around in the centre of the city! I recommend that if you are visiting London for the day to take a trip here!||September 18, 2015
Karen C||50||If you go to Hyde park you must go to the Rose Garden! It is beautiful! There are heirloom plants as well as new plants, so beautiful. When you continue down the paths be sure to walk along by The Long Water towards The Serpentine the water fowl and plants are beautiful! There are lounge chairs and park benches throughout the park to sit and watch the world go by. There were buskers, ice cream trolley's and more. Be sure to take a double decker bus to Hyde Park Corner then go into the park from there! There is the Marble Arch, Kensington Palace, The Serpentine, The Serpentine Museum and many more. Be sure to be around when the changing of the guard happens so you can see the horses and guards, very cool experience. Don't go to London and miss Hyde Park||September 18, 2015
bnghanem||40||For fun go Hyde ParkIn order to feed the birds in the lakeOr to watch Sunday speakers corner or relaxAlso it's good for sports and walking||September 18, 2015
gunroom||50||We went for the Festival, second year running, and was not disappointed. What a fantastic, extremely well organised & well run venue. FULL marks to ALL who make this a really special event. We did not go to the "Proms in the Park" the night before but spoke to others who did, they had a great time as well. What a good idea to host 2 events over the weekend and make good use of the facilities. Really worth the trip.Oh and the park is great as well.||September 18, 2015
994alano||40||I only watched the concert on television. Bryan Adams was brilliant singing his catalogue of songs but rodders, oh dear. I think rod Stewart is brilliant have danced across the room many times to him. Every picture tells a story, mandolin wind and of course Maggie May to name some of his fantastic.He is a fantastic entertainer but unless he had a sore throat, his voice is terrible. Thought I might go see him in Las Vegas but it would be a big mistake. Throw away the microphone rodders.||September 17, 2015
greg1246||50||We were told that this park was a great place to take a stroll. An old park that was once used as the Royal Family hunting ground. Big open park which also has lakes and wooded areas. In one of the corners there is "Speakers Corner." I had read this could be fun and it sure didn't disappoint. When we went on a Sunday morning there were crowds around 4 speakers. They were all giving a monologue on religion, politics or whatever else they wanted to spew about. The funny part was that some of the audience would start debating them to the point it got very very heated. Wow it was so entertaining and totally caught us of guard. At the end of the stay in London I asked our 18 and 19 year old what the highlight was and they said one of the top five was definitely Speakers Corner!!!!||September 17, 2015
johncb7||40||Take a stroll. Use this park as a cut through from Park Lane to Knightbridge. Go for a row on the Serpentine. Listen at Speakers Corner. Always something to look at or do. Great place for a walk in the shade on a hot summers day in London. Yes they do happen every now and again!!||September 17, 2015
ZRoseA||50||One of my favourite places to visit in summer! I spend almost everyday either walking through there, sitting down during my lunch or absorbing the beautiful rays of sunshine after work!! The cafe is very pricey so be sure to take your own beverages and food, however it's a great place to grab a table in winter and enjoy the beautiful serpentine watching the swans and ducks glide past! Another one of my favourite things to do there in the summer is to take out a boat- rentals are also a little pricey but it's great exercise and gives you a different angle of the park! ||September 17, 2015
Noor83||40||I love this park, its big, has places to eat, play and just relax.You can come here on your own to have some time out, with a partner for a nice romantic stroll or with friends and family for a nice picnic and activities.The last time we came was with my nephews who are 3 and 5 and they had a fantastic time. We had a picnic, they played football and we went on the boats. The weather was in our favour so we had an enjoyable day!||September 17, 2015
sparrowxo||50||lovely big park where you can watch the swans and lay about (when it isn't raining). It is not as dynamic as Central Park in NYC with lots of different terrains but it is big. The highlight to me is the statue of Peter Pan which brings to live the great J. M. Barrie story about the boy who never grew up.||September 17, 2015
Davide L||40||Well, it's not my favourite park in London (mainly because is full of tourists) but the atmosphere is amazing, if it allows you to wake up a morning and jog in a place full of swans, squirrels and big enough to make you forget you are living in a 8 million people city is definitely a good place.||September 17, 2015
PegPowler||40||Obviously, it's busy; it's in the capital. There was also a demo on there so couldn't really relax and enjoy the park so will have to visit again, but was a nice area.||September 17, 2015
ritumittal81||40||if you love long peaceful walks, then this is the place to go to on a sunny afternoon in London summer. Enjoy the flora and the fauna - the park has some lovely ducks you can sit and watch them and spend a relaxing afternoon with loved ones||September 17, 2015
Mardress58||50||I love feeling small in Hyde Park. I love the green the lake the swans the lunchtime people the dogs the trees the squirrels the fountains the statues the flowers the peace. All you need to do in Hyde Park is walk, sit, relax and breathe. ||September 16, 2015
Maggie W||50||Had an amazing time there I went with the girls scouts on a trip there would go again but don't have the money||September 16, 2015
Chrisp1069||50||Hyde Park is simple gorgeous. I tool a long walk through it on a sunny Sunday, walking along the Serpentine lake. The lawns, flowers, trees and lake are gorgeous. It was wonderfully relaxing.||September 16, 2015
snggglbnnny||50||Great park for renting a bike and riding around. Only 2£ to rent. There is a bike rental at each end. Be aware, is there is more than 2 of you and it is a nice day, you may have difficulty getting bikes. People have a tendency to claim before they buy the ticket by throwing all their stuff in a basket or laying hand on it uttering "mine, mine, mine" like the seagulls in Finding Nemo. Best bet is to get the bikes you can, and wait for someone to return a bike. Also, if the light is red, something is wrong and it won't let you put the code in, so if you plan to "lay claim", make sure it shows green. Be aware, you can only bike up and down certain areas. Pretty park with nice ponds with paddle boats on some and a restaurant with outdoor picnic benches. Grab a cold one and people and bird watch for a bit. Of course, Kensington palace is also in Hyde Park if you desire pictures of the royal princes residence.||September 16, 2015
Daniela R||50||The biggest park in London offers a lot of entertainment. You can enter it in the north side and just take a walk, see the lakes, take some pictures of the birds, catch a coffee or a tea at the cafe and just absorb the simple pleasures of life. If you're in London during winter/Christmas time you can visit the Winter Wonderland a festive family favorite with ice skating, shows, and a huge Christmas market||September 16, 2015
nodstarz||50||Have visited the park many times and to this day I do not think I have seen it all and that's a shame as I live in London. ||September 16, 2015
JimW551||50||I have run around Hyde Park early in the morning countless times and I never get tired of it. I wish more US cities had large parks like this. So much going on here with Speaker's Corner anne various monuments and landmarks! Spend a few hours here to walk and relax.||September 16, 2015
Sylvia D||30||We were there for the Radio 2 all day concert,primarily to see Rod Stewart. It was a beautiful day and very busy . As there were families there people were spread out on rugs and blankets having picnics. All we heard was to move in closer to let more people in! It was a whole day event and being huddled together in the heat was not what we wanted. The minute you moved people encroached on your space. Not very well organised, too large a crowd. The main gate was closed when we came out and we had to keep askin for directions to get back to our hotel. Exit gate was too narrow. Good job was brilliant.||September 16, 2015
mgerhardt||40||I think the sign said the park size was 500 acres but in any case it is BIG. The walk from the Rose Garden (a must - near the Underground stop) to Speakers Corner (active mostly on Sundays) was a hike.. The Serpentine waterway (built for the children of one of the monarchs) is really beautiful. To eat however we left the park and sought out a restaurant in Kensington on Yelp||September 16, 2015
JTF1228||50||Absolutely beautiful and a great place to simply spend some time. It's easy to cut through the parks to get anyplace in the central parts of London. ||September 16, 2015
Richard H||50||We checked out the park the day before the event using Boris bikes, £2 for 24 hours of use. This was a fantastic way to get around the park. For the event itself, a few tips if you go next year as I couldn't find a lot; Arrive early, the tickets stated that the gates opened at 11:00 am, we got there at 10:30 am and there were already huge numbers there. Take a picnic blanket with you, it's a good way of getting a reasonable area for yourself as you will be there for a good ten hours. You can take chairs but you will have to sit quite a long way back and have less room. I'm sure there were a few "blanket wars" but we were surrounded by a lovely group who we came to know over the course of the day, just be aware that if you leave more than 6" to the next blanket, someone WILL sit there! That's OK though and you will become friends once the music starts. Definitely take some food with you - although the concession stands were expensive the queues weren't too bad. Also take some plastic water bottles as there are free water refill sites near the loos. Speaking of which, I was surprised at how well the toilets handled 55,000 people! At no point did I have to queue for a cubicle and the staff on hand did an excellent job of keeping toilet paper and hand towels stocked up. My wife had a similar experience with the ladies toilets. I would definitely recommend this event and will no doubt try to go again next year.||September 16, 2015
Lovetravel02||40||Fantastic to have a park of this size in this location. Enormous, and very relaxing to walk through, and to take a break from the busy streets.||September 16, 2015

Tim L||50||Just across from our hotel was Hyde Park/Kensington Palace. Beautiful park with something for everyone. Be it a morning stroll, bringing the kids to the Diana memorial playground or rocking out to a live Bryan Adams concert, Hyde park is the place!||September 15, 2015
Robby48||50||So well organised! A credit to the organisers of this event. Smooth entry at the gate, well run & over 500 loos! ||September 15, 2015
Gerry R||50||We went to the Radio 2 Party in the Park, what a fantastic day! The bar organisation was really good and you weren't waiting forever to be served! However, I was dreading wanting to go to the loo as with these events, you have to queue for ages and they are usually smelly, dirty, and 9/10 times have no loo roll, well, when I got to the loo area I was very surprised to see that there was no queue as such, the toilets (absolutely loads of them!) were clean and smelt fresh, and there was loads of loo roll!! (fellas, you just don't understand how much us ladies need loo roll!) attendants were also present.All in all, a fantastic day and so well organised, well done to all involved and we shall see you again next year!||September 15, 2015
Syazana K||50||Very clean and extremely large, Hyde Park houses mny statues and also the Kensington Palace. There is a pond that you can take a paddle boat on, bicycle lanes (you can even rent them at the park), grassy areas you can have a lie down or picnic... Or you could play fetch with a dog. Theres also a great big pond in the middle of the park with a lot of swans, ducks and geeses. Simply gorgeous if you love nature!||September 15, 2015

Evelina_Rom||30||I was lucky enough to have a sunny day when went to this park - it's pretty much a normal park like any other normal park - the only difference is that it's, indeed, huge.not necessarily a priority if you have only a few days to visit London.||September 14, 2015
Pamela J||50||We had a lovely strole around, went round the outside of kensington palace and had a lovely cup of coffee at the shop/cafe. Would have loved to stop longer but went to radio 2 party in the park. Highly recommend both (party in the park mid Septemberweekend)||September 14, 2015
umsalman21||50||This an old-time favorite park for me, any visit to London will not be complete without enjoying Hyde-park.This year the addition of bike rides was a plus. ||September 14, 2015
kintyparrot||40||Great park lovely walks,wild bird life great plenty of types of birds ducks pelicans?good toilets but you have to pay.||September 14, 2015
iliascontreas||50||If I were still living in London, I would go to Hyde Park spending a few hours every weekend. I love the accuracy of the whole park, taken care in every single detail. It's one of my favourite places in London.||September 14, 2015
katew257||50||We were lucky enough to be going to the Proms in the Park and so were able to experience walking through the park with a good number of people also heading to the party.What amazed me was how many squirrels I saw, really close to people but still going about their business!Would love to spend more time in the park and explore it further but from what I saw it was a lovely space.||September 14, 2015
Nicky G||40||I have visited Hyde park on numerous occasions for concerts and events , this time it was for radio 2 party in the park who's line up included Rod Bryan Adams the Coors Leona Lewis and Georgio Mouroda who is an Italian D J ..Quite an impressive line up to keep you entertained on a Sunday oh and various BBC Entertainers dancers from strictly D J s Chris Evans Tony Blackburn !! Jo Willey And even Anika rice doing a challenge ... It was all good family fun and luckily I didn't rain lol the concert was well organised with only a slight hitch with timing just before Rodders took the stage not his fault I'm afraid Chris Evans was to blame but it was still fun as he made us sing God save the queen ... The toilets and food stalls were well organised which is a bonus when you go to these events , and the marshalls done a good job directing people during and after the event all in all 50 thousand people seemed to enjoy themselves||September 14, 2015
ChrisG932||40||We only had one day at Hyde Park unfortunately, but what a majestic place to get away from the hustle and bustle that is London. We travelled in winter so it was not exceptionally busy, but I can fully imagine it being alive during summer with wide expanses of greenery, lakes and wildlife. A definate must see if in London.||September 13, 2015
Raihan S||40||It is a big park with long walk ways. There is a separate track for cyclists. You can take princess Diana walkway. Excellent lake in the middle. Lots of people jogging and running. Plenty of picnic spots. It is adjacent to Queens Park so can visit that too. The coffee in the middle of the park is quite awesome too. I have forgotten the name of coffee shop.||September 13, 2015
diver010Denver||50||Wide open spaces to lay out on a blanket, a very scupltured area with water falls and carefully mnowed grass but wild meadows with tall grass & thistles left to go as natures wishes, Take in the speaker's corner's with an open mind! Those speakers talk about any subject with a audience that will spout back their opinions as well. A large pond with small boats for rent. At another section the smaller version of the London Eye. Plus 2 -3 concessions stands with snack like meals & ice cream!Seemed to have both the festival atmosphere and the very quiet commune with nature aspect. ||September 13, 2015
Jan S||40||So much to see and do. A huge park with lovely pathways and beautiful flowers and tree. Wish we would have had more time.||September 13, 2015
MrsLRL||50||I hired a bike and cycled around Hyde park, it is huge there is so much to see and do. I really enjoyed it.||September 13, 2015
brisemark||50||Our experience of this park is somewhat limited as we walked through it on our way to Proms in the Park. The park is a real credit and has lovely walks. I hope to visit it again soon when it's not so crowded with partygoers.||September 13, 2015
David L||40||We were here in 2013 for the itu world Olympic distance triathlon. A great event for competitors and athletes close to all the good things to see!||September 13, 2015
William F||50||Hyde Park is wonderful. Very well maintained. There is a very beautiful and clean lake. In this park you have several choices of activities. There are beautiful gardens. It is an amazing place in a metropolis like London. I strongly suggest a visit.||September 13, 2015
samantha f||50||it's one of the biggest and famous park, and it's really awesome, if you want to relax you can spend your time there, and enjoy all that nature!||September 13, 2015
Wendie007||50||Nice , clean park. My husband and I would take walks daily. Nice to see people exercising with personal trainers in the park. Very clean. We visited the Princess Diana fountains.||September 13, 2015
302mollys||40||Hyde Park is huge which gives you plenty of opportunities to find somewhere to relax and just unwind. The best time to visit is on a sunny day.||September 13, 2015
harpersa80||30||Vast open space, well sign posted to sights of interest within the park. Boats available for hire on the Serpentine but the swimming area was covered in goose droppings, very off putting. Cafes not cheap.||September 13, 2015
Vinay H||30||The park is decent, has a large water body, bang across the Buckingham palace and has hungry birds and friendly squirrels. There were no exotic birds in summer, so ignore the comment about birds being fed at 2.30 PM, at least for the summer time.||September 13, 2015
629lauran||30||This park is artificial, like most parks in the middle of a city, but this one also looks look it. It's not cozy at all, because it's very bare of naked and that's boring. There are some squirrels, but you have them in other parks to, so that's not special either. I think this park is overrated and the grass and footpaths to much straightforward!||September 12, 2015
Veratanshuling83||40||Last time i came here was in winter, completely different scenery. In winter it is quiet and calmer, has a certain charm to it. In summer, it's bustling with people lounging around in the sun, activities going on at the pond and green trees providing shade for those who want it. A nice escape from the buzz of the city. Getting a bit touristy but still a nice place to take a walk in. ||September 12, 2015
dror32||40||this is a big and nice park, i personally like st.james better, but its still lovely and worth a visit if youre close to it.||September 12, 2015
Paul C||50||Lovely park, flowers, landscaping, scenery, tranquility,Awesome birds, ponds, wrought iron seats etc. a place you will love and enjoy.||September 12, 2015
sherryelmo||50||Very beautiful and peaceful with lovely water ways with ducks and swans. It was a wonderful break from the rush of the city. Just a short walk and nature was there.||September 12, 2015
537gordonw||50||You can not beat a stroll through the park with the one you love. Take the time to smell the flowers, best way to travel is either the London tube-Oyster Card, or by scenic bus that you can get on and off for 1-2-3 days.||September 12, 2015
buffalojim67||40||One of the places that keeps London so unique. Hyde Park is always alive with walkers, joggers, families out for the day and people just enjoying the open air, the greenery and the calm of the park, its water features and other monuments.||September 12, 2015
Yorkie137||40||When you enter the park you leave the noise of the streets behind, even though the busy roads are only a short distance away it is easy to shut them out. A stroll round the lake is a great way to unwind. We also took in the London bombings memorial which is in a quiet spot near the southern exit onto Park Lane, probably easy to miss unless you pass by.The only detriment is the many cyclists that ignore the No Cycling signs on the narrow footpaths and refuse to keep to the cycle paths provided.||September 12, 2015
extratowelsplease||50||Fantastic place to take children or walk as a couple. Have fun on the lake and paddle in the Princess of Diana Memorial fountains. You can also swim in the Lake from the Lido - we did not - but looked nice.Take a pick nick.||September 12, 2015
Smith K||40||One great way to see the park is by renting a Santander bike and riding around the park. Also one must not miss the serpentine which is the most beautiful part of the park.||September 12, 2015
Z4441SXsandym||40||A beautiful and massive park we walked all the way around and it took us a couple of hours but you can hire bikes on every corner and very reasonable especially as its all flat...Speakers corner is an experience everybody shouting over each other...there are many many different species of birds even Herons, squirrels by the hundred a lot being hand fed and wild parrots.||September 11, 2015
Mi-Dan20||50||We love Hyde Park, we always stay in the area close to the park therefore have been several times. We have found it makes for easier walking access to and from destinations. It is a pleasant stroll when going to and from places and / or to stop to relax. Great people watching too, we always enjoy this park.||September 11, 2015
ofra01||40||London is famous for its parks, and I make a point to visit a new one every time I visit. But the Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park is always included. Walking around the park, seeing the wildlife (squirrels), people walking their dogs, and of course the large variety of water birds on the lake is instant stress relief.||September 11, 2015
JoeGregory||40||I enjoy heading through Hyde Park to get away from the streets on London, there is plenty to walk around and at times its very calming as long as you make sure you stay away from the cycle lanes or it becomes a game of leap frog.Also take a blanket with you if you want to sit, or you'll pay a fortune for a chair!||September 11, 2015
Danielle P||40||Large park with ample spots for a picnic. Really enjoyed walking around the rose garden and Princess Diana memorial.||September 11, 2015
Mudit22||40||It feels like heaven there. I loved it so much but the thing was that we could not get our bycycle there but still amazing. Worth It||September 11, 2015
TomandJane||50||What a lovely peaceful park this is and so so big. Once you step inside and walk further in you no longer hear the traffic and it is so tranquil. The walks are lovely and all the attractions are clearly marked. We only managed about maybe a quarter of the park and after over three hours you need something to stimulate the brain. Will visit the park again, maybe in a different season?||September 11, 2015
Travelcooking||50||The biggest and maybe also the most notorious park in London, I personally think the most gorgeous! Lots of picnic spots, you can really enjoy it for a walk in a sunny afternoon... The park is really huge, so... use the Hide Park Corner entrance and turn on the left... you can really appreciate that part of it, but if you have time and you are fit, try to take a look of the whole park, till Marble Arch, Lancaster Gate and Kensington Gardens. Don't miss it! A W E S O M E !||September 10, 2015
JohnnyUK7||50||Either grab a picnic, walk through and explore or just sit and watch the world go by in this most wonderful park, right in the centre (almost) of London. Such a tranquil park and so many interesting features including the formal gardens, Princess Diana Memorial, the wilderness areas, the Peter Pan statue, places to sit and rest on could spend hours in this park handy to Buckingham Palace, Harrods and Marble Arch.Don't forget the watch the lovely little grey squirrels and their antics. My favourite park :-) - pure heaven!||September 10, 2015
jackpW8748CI||50||I wish I lived closer, but the commute is always worth it. Whether your: Running, Dog-Walking, Playing Sports, or just having a casual picnic, this is place for you. You spend 5 minutes to a whole day there, it's a pretty special place.||September 10, 2015
Sandeepbangia||40||A huge green patch in the middle of the city. I visited in the morning on a bike and saw that the place is full of people who were walking, jogging, biking or just exercising, the horses from the royal stable are also paraded here in the mornings and is a nice to watch activity. While the notice board suggested a lot of activities that were scheduled in the park, to me just a walk in the park seeing Londoners going through their routine was a satisfying few hours spent.||September 10, 2015
whetstoneview||40||This is a fantastic park to walk through rather than following pavement routes or catching public transport. The trees, grass and flowers are very well kept and it is difficult to believe you are in such a busy city.Walk along the various paths to visit all the items clearly signposted at frequent points and don't miss all the wildlife which abounds within the park.We even saw some Horse Guards drilling near the exit to Birdcage Walk.||September 10, 2015
Alan157243||30||My wife and I with our 3 daughters stayed in London and took a couple of hours to walk around Hyde park, it was October so not the warmest or most picturesque time of year but even so it was a pleasant afternoon||September 10, 2015
364germainec||40||well this is lovely to walk around any time of year and easy to get to on the bus from victoria weve been many times during the winter- in dec winter wonderland lots of Fun for all the family||September 10, 2015
natalexnew||50||Perfect on a sunny day!! Endless, beautiful park. Plenty of picnic spots. If you are lucky you might overhear music rehearsals at the staidum too. ||September 10, 2015
Scott W||30||Nice place for a walk and of course to see the soapbox speakers at "Speakers' Corner". I was a bit disappointed and I guess expected more. Good for people watching. ||September 10, 2015
KemiS||40||Had a pleasant afternoon walk through hyde park with a friend. Lovely and tranquil. Didn't really have a destination, and enjoyed the 'aimless' meandering. Stubbled across the hyde park community allotment and was very impressed with the communal spirit as we chatted with the volunteers there. Definitely a pleasant way to spend the late morning/afternoon.||September 10, 2015
achacuu||50||I've always known Hyde Park only partly, only the little part nearby Bayswater and never actually spent time in the park until last August 2015. Me and my boyfriend was in London and we stayed at a hotel nearby Victoria station, and that day we planned to have lunch around Bayswater area. I wanted to take tubes, and he insisted to walk. I thought what an awful idea! So we walked, and ended up feeling great bout the journey. We were actually in the park and get to see the parts we've never seen before on the park. There were this lake filled with swans and at some people were swimming too! Weather was great at that time completed the unexpected interesting journey for Chinese cuisine lunch! Definitely will come back if i had the chance||September 9, 2015
dorinser||30||Probably the most notorious park in London, Hyde Park is also very big (approx 1,5 square km) Very suitable for biking, horse riding or walking. Don't expect anything spectacular inside: trees, grass, flowers and the Serpentine lake. If it's on your checklist, do cross it from Bayswater to Kensington or walk between its two gates, Apsley Gate and Marble Arch), both are nice walks.||September 9, 2015
Jeff M||50||A stroll through this amazing park is a must do for any London traveler. The flowers, gardens, and trees are gorgeous and there is plenty of room to spread out and find some peace and quiet in the middle of one of the world's biggest cities. It was a special delight to watch the young children play in the Princess Diana memorial water fountain--a fitting tribute to her. Plenty of eateries to catch a bite or brew along the Serpentine lake that flows through this wonderful and huge park. Plan to spend at least one hour or two to enjoy it properly. I wanted to walk the entire length of the park, but ran out of time--what a gem in the middle of this bustling city. ||September 9, 2015
sander s||40||After window shopping at Selfridges, we walked to Harrods (Knightsbridge) through Hyde park on a Sunday. It brought back memories of Central Park, where I played as a child. When the weather is good, families are out, people are horseback riding, and canoeing in the lake. There are vendors selling snacks, and its just a great relief from Londons hustle.||September 9, 2015
Mary K||50||Whenever anyone would tell me about Hyde Park, I honestly didn't really get what all the fuss was about. After all, it was just a giant field and a few trees, right? No. Hyde Park is so much more than that! With Fountains, memorial statues (specifically the Diana Memorial), the Serpentine Lido, the Serpentine Gallery, parks, Great food and drinks at Fortnum and Mason and tours you can go on! Also, every year around Christmas, the Winter Wonderland is held here! And I'm sure there's ever more than what I've describe in this sanctuary of London||September 9, 2015
Danny D||50||This is just another of so many spectacular parks tucked away all over London. You can get some really wonderful pictures here with all the wildlife flying and swimming around. Trust me, take a camera. Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain is here and quite interesting. Check out Speaker’s Corner to catch some interesting people, sometimes.||September 9, 2015
Patrizia19721234||50||If you want to spend a great sunny day having fun and relax, go to Hyde Park! The park is really beautiful and there are many things to do with and without children!!!||September 9, 2015
Kamcio||20||I was a bit disappointed. Just a big park, with not a nice grass or flowers. Small disorder. But has some nice spots so for sure everyone will find something for himself.||September 9, 2015
swift314||30||Really just a pretty park a quiet space in London to get away from the traffic - same as parks all over the world but nice to wander through||September 8, 2015
Anshul K||40||Its just a park like normal other park - so if you have less time to visit London, you can skip this. London has lot more beautiful attractions which you can go for instead of wasting time here.||September 8, 2015
coral-35-y||50||Stopped in this park on hot sunny day, lots going on,but toilets are not free, need coins think it was either 20p or 50p. Had a lovely picnic and enjoyed watching everyone around. There is a cafe reasonably price can get ice creams as well. There is a lake with ducks and swans on it the cafe has toilets if you buy something you can use for free. I love this park has winter wonderland at Christmas look out for it this year it's there every year.||September 8, 2015
Shane S||50||walking through hyde park provides a break from the busy metro that is london, you can watch children play with boats in a pond with geese, or sit under one of the 100+ year old trees and stare off into space||September 8, 2015
Nancy C||50||Beautiful park. Don't miss the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. The park is perfect for an afternoon stroll and is a peaceful respite from the busy city.||September 8, 2015
Furry1208||40||I went here with friends on a lovely day. We thought about going on the boats but it was so busy so we didnt. The park is huge and it would take a long time to walk all the way round. Lovely on a summers day.||September 8, 2015
Arbit_Random||40||A really good place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. Especially when you are tired from site seeing activities in rest of the London.||September 8, 2015
PRANICK||40||You can not have a complete view of London city till you take a stroll through Hyde Park. I have been there so many times, but the last one is precious for me to remember. It was summer, and I managed to persuade my daughter to have a round on Serpentine lake on a lake-bike. It was absolutely a relaxing, funny and enjoying experience. We then met the rest of the family and we all had a cup of tea at the open air bar, watching the rest lake-bikes on their cruise. Having finished our tea, we continued our walk through this nice park and visited the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, where a lot of children were splashing and playing with the water. Finally, we could not miss the sportive little squirrels,playing hide and seek into the bushes. My daughter was thrilled to watch them and took a lot of pictures. We really enjoyed every minute in this park, although it was very crowded.||September 7, 2015
W3630BGemilys||50||We really enjoyed Hyde Park. It was a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city, and the gardens were lovely.

AnnaMonkey||40||Worth going to see the pelicans, as it's such an unusual sight! Great to relax in with a picnic in the summer, and you can always find a quiet spot.||September 7, 2015
Aitlem||40||The largest park in London. Not as nice like St. James's Park, but you'll find quite a lot of wildlife in here. (Squirrels, ducks, swans) For a few pounds you can rent a boat and ride on the lake.||September 7, 2015
Carla F||50||One of the loveliest parks I've been to anywhere. Huge grounds, fastidiously maintained, great cycle paths and lots of picnic space/spots. Also lots of things going on of a weekend. Must see.||September 7, 2015
Robin_Knowles||40||The park is much larger than you might expect and merges with Kensington Gardens. It is a delightful place for a stroll or to sit and read and it's remarkably easy to find peace and solitude.It is easy to get to from Marble Arch or Hyde Park Corner underground stations.||September 7, 2015
desmo19||50||Truly a paradise. Great, quiet. It allows you to do any activity or meeting you want. How to get out of the city but to be the center of everything. Easy to get to. One of the most beautiful parks in the world!||September 7, 2015

werners67||40||While you are in London, you have to go to Hyde Park. During a Sunday afternoon, even the "Speaker's Corner" was busy like anything. Prepare for a longer walk or rent a bike. The park is enjoyable but quite a walk.||September 6, 2015

marion2715||50||We ended up walking through Hyde Park en-route to our destination as we got slightly lost and I'm glad we did. I had never imagined Hyde Park to be as lovely as it is. The fountains and the large boating lake were you can hire boats or pedalos were a complete surprise to me. If anyone is visiting London and its a fine day and they want a bit of "chill" time - its well worth a visit. ||September 5, 2015
C7AMW||50||Lovely large park ( free ) . You could easily spend all day here. Feed the ducks, swans etc, Then watch as the cheeky squirrels try to get up close. Make sure you have something to dry childrens' feet, as they will want to paddle in the Princess Diana memorial garden.||September 5, 2015
Ciaron G||30||very nice place. Lovely park and great views. Animals everywhere and the squirrels eat from your hand, crazy. Long walk from hyde park corner to kensington palace. Get the 52 bus down if you have small kids as it is a long walk.||September 5, 2015

Msintorquay||50||Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant. Great place to go for a stroll and relax, with plenty of places to sit down and watch the world go by. We were there on warm days where alot of people were out and about. There are opportunities to buy food, drinks or treats, with the prices acceptable. Be sure to take a umbrella on sunny days as there will be times you will not be able to walk under shaded area's. The squirrels are friendly. Lovely place to relax and unwind.||September 5, 2015
Elias T||20||Hyde park is a very nice central park, it is incredibly big and at some point you won't be able to see the city anymore!!Despite that there is not much to do in the park.If you are in hyde park during christmas don't miss winter wonderland !||September 4, 2015
Life_Art_Food||40||A beautiful green serene space to relax and exercise in the heart of London. What I didn't like was the street in the middle of it which brings noise and pollution into this quiet oasis.||September 4, 2015
Life_Art_Food||40||Several landmarks and art installation in this place beside the Arch. A famous quote was inscribed in a closely exhibit: "Freedom is the sure possession of those alone who have the courage to defend it." - Pericles||September 4, 2015
sarahpWiltshire||50||We had a large lunch at Hard Rock Café and as it was a nice sunny day in August we decided to walk our meal off with a stroll around the park.You walk through the impressive park gates into a large peaceful green space. All the flower beds and grass is well kept and tidy. Just inside there is a large map showing you where you are and where to go in the park. We decided to walk alongside the large lake. No swimming is aloud in the lake and there are plenty of ducks and swans to feed. There is a large restaurant in the park where you can stop for a icecream or have a meal, the menu looked good. We walked through the park and out the other side where we got the tube to our next stop on our day trip.||September 4, 2015

Gen I||50||Hyde Park is every bit as beautiful as the guide books say. Lush gardens and open spaces that just beg for you to take your shoes off and wriggle your toes in the grass. Paddle boats are available for the more energetic or enjoy a meal in the lakeside cafe. Hire a bike and pedal around for a few hours and make the most of any sunshine.||September 3, 2015

tootp||50||Busy, busy, busy, watch out for cyclists and roller skaters, don't accidently walk into the cycle/roller path as you could come to grief. Of course 'Speakers Corner' is worth a look/listen. There are places to buy refreshments. As long as you keep aware the park is lovely but very busy throughfare to Hyde Park Corner/top of Oxford Street. ||September 3, 2015
CRK430||50||Hyde park reminds me of central park in New York, very lively yet peaceful, visitors enjoying their books, roller-skating, paddling, picnicking. I especially like the serpentine waterfront.A park for everyone. ||September 3, 2015
SmileyKay||40||Pleasant, quiet, relaxing day in the nature. Don`t miss Speakers` Corner if you are there on a Sunday - with topics varying from politics and religion to sexual freedom, you can assist to monologues or even debates on almost everything. Some are nothing but fun while others can even make you stop and think...!||September 3, 2015
Rohit S||50||The best thing we did in London, one need to reach here just before lunch time, grab a paddle boat and take a stroll in the beautiful lake. It was a perfect weather, I was travelling with my wife, 3 yr old daughter and Parents and all the ages loved it. Nothing could have been better than this boat ride between swans, just loved it.||September 2, 2015
Cindy G||50||We walked in the park in the rain. The grass, the trees, the flowers, the birds, and the water, all very pretty. The runners just ran in the rain. Not crowded, not noisy. I still have my smile when writing this review.||September 2, 2015

LiSteadz||40||walked all around here very nice park ~ and it was a great day for a walk ~ not too many facilities though ~ might be more difficult if you have young kids or older people with you. ||September 2, 2015

Earnest186411||50||Don't miss Hyde Park if you are a tourist. It's iconic, pleasant, relaxing, well kept and free of charge. We are very lucky to have it so freely available in this amazing part of the capital.||September 2, 2015
AdventureSheSaid||40||Lovely place to picnic, when the weather allows, be sure to bring a blanket. In the summer there are loads of facilities you can hire, such as paddle boats - and its a great way to break up a busy sightseeing day!||September 2, 2015

HBBG6688||50||This is a brilliant place for walking, running and relaxing. It is beautiful and peaceful which almost makes one forget that he is in London. It is definitely quieter than the Central Park in New York. This is a "must-see" place when visiting London.||September 2, 2015
kayaker1953||40||2 nd Hotel was located nearby with 3 hrs "to kill"waiting for room to become available. It is VERY relaxing stroll and plenty of site and interesting sections to take in.||September 1, 2015

Chevon M||40||Spent a sunny July afternoon people watching with family here. Lovely atmosphere; there were some tame birds and people walking well behaved dogs too. No one blaring music or misbehaved children. The park is well kept and a pleasure to visit, especially after spending the morning walking from gallery to gallery.||September 1, 2015
DianeY204||50||Very large. Must see Diana Memorial and Kensington Palace. It's beautiful on a nice day. Seemed like we walked forever to get thru it on a cold rainy day. Beautiful foundations, ducks etc.||September 1, 2015

Phee_Bizz||50||This is my favourite park in London. It offers so many wonderful things, from the beautiful rose gardens, Italian gardens, Serpentine, boat hire, and Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, not to forget poets corner and the infamous Winter Wonderland when the weather turns chilly.It's definitely worth visiting and experiencing just how beautiful this piece of London is.||September 1, 2015
53bob22||40||A great relaxing spot for visitors families and on a pleasant summers day to see all the lawns, birdlife and ducks the water and to be so close to Kensington Palace||September 1, 2015

Mich B||50||Enjoyed walking through the park. Weather was great, so we could lay down in the grass and relax for a bit. ||September 1, 2015
mrscatred||50||Lovely park, nice and clean and activities for all. Well worth a visit. Kids loved the squirrels and watching horse riding and boats. Just needed a bit of sunshine and it would have been perfect!||September 1, 2015
904ivettev||50||What a beautiful park - Hyde Park. Was able to take a photo of some older folks just sitting around the park bench chatting and pigeons just hanging with them. spectacular photo moment.||September 1, 2015
nini154||50||After 3 gorgeous hours at the Natural History Museum, our mental batteries were empty. We reloaded them with a walk through Hyde Park, which is just a 10-15 minutes' walk away from Natural History Museum, Science Museum and V&A Museum. You can hire a boat, walk through the park, enjoy the Italian Gardens or take a glance at Kensington Palace. On the other side of the park, you will find tube station "Lancaster Gate" which connects you to other parts of the city. ||August 31, 2015
rvpmumbai||50||If I ever wanna go back to stay longer in London, it would be so I can spend more time here. Laze around near the Pond or Ride a Bike all over at Sunset !! Take the Kids to the Diana Memorial Playground within or let them run free on the grass. Ducks waiting for crumbs in the water. Lots of Walkers and Joggers, but such a huge and well maintained Park, that it never seems crowded. The cities we come from long to have a space like this !! Kudos to the authorities -- Maintenance is amazing. Multiple entry and exits with variable timings...better check before you enter...walking from one gate to another can take 30-45 mins and u don't wanna find the gate closed. Bang in the centre of London, close to all Attractions. After a tiring early day, one can come here around early evening and spend a couple of hours doing nothing and just enjoying Nature. Awesome !!||August 31, 2015
582bastik||50||If it's a nice sunny day or at least a bit warm, go to a supermarket around the park take your friends but some drinks and snacks and then go to the park and lay in the sun chairs and enjoy a nice day with heaps of people in this lovely park. Also great for long walks ||August 31, 2015
Eagle11111||50||There are bicycles available for rent which is a new initiative from the Mayor Boris Johnson.You are able to cycle around Hyde Park as well as green Park.Return the Bicycles and renew your membership at any other Bicycle station in London.This entitles you to ride anywhere in London where bicycles are allowed.||August 31, 2015
afroditis53||50||every time i visit London its mandatory for me to visit Hyde Park!its a huge green park!its a very nice spot to have a lunch at the grass and hang out with your friends !!i love it!||August 31, 2015
Grant N||50||We wandered through Hyde Park on a nice day about 3 pm - obviously most people were at work but there were quite a few doing the same as us. While we were there it was just a peaceful and relaxed time - lots of bird life. As we left a group of young men started a soccer game. The park looks like a nice place to wander and chill out - nice to have a really green area in the middle of a city||August 31, 2015
ravindransidhu||50||Hyde park is Beautiful to walk through to get away from the busyness of London. There is a tranquil and peaceful calm, although there are hundred/thousands of people running around through the park. There are some breathtaking parts of this including Serpentine entrance where we came across the lake and fed some ducks I also took a small paddling boat with our children.we also had some lunch at the Serpentine Cafe. Be aware that this is quite expensive.we didn't realise the price until we got the bill but the weather was nice so it was a treat for us to splash out. I will definitely recommend going to Hyde park if you are in London. ||August 31, 2015
Tommy66squid||30||Lots of open space but not very pretty. Thought they would of had something a little bit interesting to look at but it is simply a big open area.||August 31, 2015
SoloSally||50||Beautifully kept park with squirrels (my favourite part) and lots of rubbish bins and seats. It was a lovely relaxing place to have a picnic in. ||August 31, 2015
1997re||50||It's a huge park where you can take a nice long stroll. The gardens are beautifully done. You can easily spend a day there.||August 31, 2015
MLSkj||40||We was living close to Queensway U-ground and took the scenic route through the parks to Picadilly Circus or SoHo a few days , and then walked all through the park and had a picnic one day. A nice park, its big and divided up with lots of different patches, well kep areas and areas that are more or less left alone, at least to appearance. Beautiful park, lots of things to see. Do rent a bike if you like.||August 31, 2015
Ana M||50||Being a tourist this used to be the park I liked the most, as it is very well known for the gigs and festivals being host here. The park is amazing, as most London Parks. If you have to visit only one, then come to this one.||August 31, 2015
arlene05||50||Fell in love with London, so much to see and do. Hyde park, hired bicycles, stopped and had coffee . Loved Camden town, Bath, train system is amazing . Cheaper to travel outside peak hour. ||August 31, 2015
Nm-xo||50||Numerous bikes for hire and various shades of greenery no matter where you look. Gorgeous fountains and statues to make your visit that little bit better. Situated in some of the nicest areas of London which you can get to by exiting at various sides can't go wrong with Hyde park. ||August 31, 2015
william B||50||spent half a day here seen princesses fountain and the 7/7 memorial very poignant had great day-couldn't have picked better weather||August 31, 2015
Rissa1993||40||We went on the pedalos. At £12 per person, we found them really pricey, but thought it would be a nice way to spend an hour. It is a nice park, but I think it can get expensive. So, if you take a picnic and some drinks, it would be a nice family afternoon out||August 31, 2015
Tahari8||40||Amazing, huge park with lots of space to move around, enjoy the greenery. There is a huge pond with swans and ducks, and squirrels running around. It's a great place to take a morning stroll or jog. There are a couple of decently priced restaurants around the area too.||August 30, 2015
Lilstarz91||50||Been here many times. Nice in the summer when it's warm and the sun is out. Tube is not far and loads of busses near by. Big park so nice to walk around. Can go by bike or roller skates could be fun too. Good to sunbath and chill with family, friends or the other half. Wildlife to see. Nice pond. Cafe there too. They have winter wonderland in the winter nice day or night out. ||August 30, 2015
jamescZ6901HF||40||It's a great park, some areas need attention but the main areas are pleasant and it's a great place to just sit and chill out and watch the world go by. ||August 30, 2015
Julia M||40||Walking in the park it's always a good moment of any trip. Walking at the Hyde Park is always special, makes you feel part of history a little bit. ||August 30, 2015
Happy-Traveler1118||50||A very classic British experience, take a sandwich, a croissant and a hot coffee and just enjoy.Beautiful park, lovely views. ||August 30, 2015
kartik_2012||40||Best place to visit with friends and family.Get a cycle and go around the park.The lake is the best part.||August 30, 2015
duane-wood||40||Spent a lovely day here, started with hiring a "Boris Bike" for an hour so from the rack at Hyde Park Corner in the park itself. This is a good place to hire as there are TFL staff around to help. Go counterclockwise round the park from here and you will end up near Kensington Palace. Great for a "rest". Return the bike to one of the racks just off Knightsbridge and then go and get a picnic. There is 'arrods, but better value was Little Waitrose. Back to the park, hired deckchairs for 2hrs whilst having the picnic, bubbly and mid afternoon snooze. Then onto the Serpentine for rowing. This is not cheap but good fun and do these instead of the pedalo's.....less queuing.||August 30, 2015
KatyV1993||50||I went to Hyde Park British Summertime festival, mainly to just see Taylor Swift which was awesome!!! Highly recommended to go there- good music and food! Though alcohol and food very expensive!||August 30, 2015
JamieMc93||50||It's a park, so I mean, it's pretty self explanatory I guess. Nice space to bring food (a picnic or something bought in a store), and chill out and eat, and people watch.||August 30, 2015
Dawsonsiny||40||Hyde Park is a gem in the heart of London. We walked from Kensington Palace on one end to Green Park on the other. It is a long, but very enjoyable walk with fountains, gardens, parrots ( yes parrots) in the trees to fee, a lake to rent boats, geese and ducks to feed. I would also biking through the Park. Santander provides bikes at various locations throughout the city. Biking through Hyde Park on a beautiful day is a great experience and way to see the whole park.||August 29, 2015
sjabbott1||50||Huge park which is well maintained. Toilet facilities could be open a little later in the summer. Great for a walk any time of the day.||August 29, 2015
michd67||40||lots of very interesting birds. lovely to see all the people enjoying a day out with their families and friends. they could however do some cleaning of the ponds to take away the floating garbage and assorted detritus||August 29, 2015
28fahada||50||Most beautiful park I have ever visited. The Italian garden is the best. It is really an excellent place to enjoy a relaxing day with the family.||August 29, 2015
Raph L||50||wonderful place to spend time and relax. We stayed in a hotel close to Hyde park and enjoyed walking there. It is very large and so beautiful. I loved Rose garden.||August 29, 2015
traveller09Delhi||40||The place is good to spend 2-3 hours in quite environment and very green. The inside lake provides very good boating. Walk through hyde park is truly relaxing||August 28, 2015
jamtravels2015||40||Sit and relax or just stroll through the park. Take time out from the hustle and bustle and enjoy this big, beautiful greenspace in central London.||August 28, 2015
Leigh K||30||If you are a fan of historical English romance literature you know that most of the aristocracy rode about the park daily to see and be seen on horseback or in carriages. You will want to see it yourself then but having said that, it is just a park. You need to remember that you are in a big city and that they really enjoy their green space. If you need fresh air, a place to tucker the kids out or an inexpensive way to spend an afternoon then this will work fine. It is large and has a lovely lake but again, it is just a park. There are many other places to see if you have limited time to sightsee in this magnificent city.||August 28, 2015
Purpleknight1||50||It's a great place to go with a coffee and a sandwich from one of the many places surrounding the entrances, grab a seat beside the lake and watch the world go by.Definitely a must see away from the hustle and bustle of the tubes and the rest of central London!!||August 28, 2015
Saintjoan2001||50||i just love the park as there was so much happening there every time i went to uk.the best part was the special pulpit where anyone could give a speech-which is no more.there is so much to do at the park and i spent the whole day there and due to walking my feet ached and i just soaked them in Dianas water park.i did not take pic which is a pity.||August 28, 2015
waggiestravels||50||It's not often I get time to walk around the open green space in London but when I do it amazes me what can be found in the heart of London. ||August 27, 2015
Meg48_12||50||Hyde Park is a lovely place to stroll in the evening hours...or a midday stoll..the birds are interesting, the gardens are glorious and well kept...||August 27, 2015
annadraper||50||Huge park. You can see everything from Kenningston palace to the lake where you can rent paddle boats Feed the ducks as wellClose to the Paddington tube station ||August 27, 2015
JohnNieuwegein||40||Large park with lots of open spaces. Not all is interesting. The area around the Serpentine is the busiest and great place for a picnic. ||August 27, 2015
Djarmila1978||50||On the last day of my visit to London it was really hot so my niece and myself decided on a walk through Hyde Park.Hyde Park is a beautiful, big park in Central London with the Serpentine at its core. On a beautiful day loads of people are visiting the park and the atmosphere is relaxing and cozy. The park offers loads of different small highlights so there's always something to discover. Often you can find squirrels running around, some of them not too shy to take your food when offering it to them. On a hot summer day make sure to visit the Diana Memorial Fountain which is bustling with life then. Families come here to enjoy the cool water of the fountain so sit down and put your feet in the refreshing water. If you need a break from sightseeing and shopping, come to the Hyde Park to relax :-)||August 27, 2015
SweetM0lly||50||Just love this place. We walked for miles on one of the hottest days in August and it was brimming with people from all over the world enjoy the beautiful gardens and trees. Saw squirrels and plenty of assorted water fowl.||August 27, 2015
Gigi K||40||An expansive park. It is a lovely place for a walk. Not much in the way of concessions as you find in Paris Parks with quaint carts and rides for the children. But none the less, a please way to spend a few hours.||August 27, 2015
Rabbristol239||40||A pleasant walk even on a rainy day it shows in a different light diverse characters from joggers to cyclist and dog walkers.||August 27, 2015
Chinlee M||40||Just take a morning relax jogging at Hyde Park with my wife, jogging path is good, you can also see duck & goose in the lake too.||August 26, 2015
bounceyman||40||Lovely park to walk around in Summer or Winter. Is absolutely packed on sunny weekends but on weekdays it's so big you won't be bothered by anyone. Kids and adults will live the squirrels.||August 26, 2015
Janet A||50||A must see for first timers in London, if you can't walk through it, take a cab ride through it on your way to/from Paddington Station!||August 26, 2015
Hayley T||50||My first visit to Hyde Park, what a lovely place to be! Spent a couple of hours walking around, bought a drink at the serpentine cafe, very relaxing afternoon.||August 26, 2015
Akihil||50||Nice place to take a stroll and relax & the weather was too good. Very well maintained and not overly crowded.||August 26, 2015
woodlandartist||50||Wonderful place....do take a picnic and find your own spot to enjoy a quiet and peaceful, romantic time in London....give your feet a rest ! I recommend this, as well as St. James park to stroll through. Spend as much time in London as you can afford, there is so much to see and do. Cherish it.||August 26, 2015
Lilli H||40||A lovely place to walk through, especially in the summer when there is good weather. I recommend walking through hyde park from Knightsbridge (where Harrods is) up to Hyde Park corner towards Marble Arch and Oxford Street - so much more pleasant than getting the Tube!||August 26, 2015
jenniealee||50||We stopped at the Lodge Café (see that review - Lodge Cafe @ Hyde Park), and ate our lunch in the rose garden. The flowers weren't in bloom yet, but sitting there I can imagine how the different pops of color against the buildings in the background would make a perfect picture. After finishing our meal, we continued walking in Hyde Park looking for Princess Diane’s Memorial Fountain. Due to there not being any signs in the park, at most of the junctions, we got lost a few times before locating the fountain. We located the equestrian trails, the playground, squirrel sanctuary, the lake, and the nearby restaurant. When we found the fountain, we sat down and enjoyed the view of the river, the Iris Statute, and the fountain we were sitting on commemorating such an amazing lady. It is such a peaceful place, so serene.||August 25, 2015
Mark M||50||Wide open space, to relax walk around spent at least 4 hours took lunch and a bottle of wine. found a quite spot and just soaked in the atmosphere. ||August 25, 2015
starskyrules||50||We were asked to work here and it's beautiful, such a lovely place in the middle of a city. Well worth a visit.||August 25, 2015
Kimberly M||40||This was a romantic walk. The weather was beautiful, which helped, but even though the weather was perfect, it wasn't overly crowded. There was food and ice cream vendors, and a large ferriswheel. Worth walking through||August 25, 2015
Samantha R||50||Visited during a weekend and it was very busy. However it is a vast park so you can find spaces to sit. We sat and had a picnic on one of the many grass areas. There is lots to do including taking a turn at roller blading, rowing on the boating lake or just eating ice creams from the little shops.||August 25, 2015
MsRachel2014||50||I went on Aug 22 and it was a beautiful day! All I did was walking around with my friend to enjoy the perfect weather. Many people were cycling, suntanning, etc ... What a wonderful way to spend a summer afternoon||August 25, 2015
MuggleandMe||50||Wow! My son wanted to come here and we were both impressed. Got off on the tube (Hyde Park Corner) and walked up the left side of the lake. We saw a heron perched on a sign post. Went to see the Diana Memorial, which wasn't as I expected from a distance, but as you get closer it's actually very clever. My son (11) questioned why children were allowed to paddle in it if it's a memorial and I explained that Diana loved children so I'm sure she would be pleased. Carried on up and my son found a big bunch of house keys on the grass. We handed them in to a police car at the top of the park. I hope they got back to their owner.We stopped for a photo at the Peter Pan statue, then in the Italian garden. So pretty. Much needed peace and a lovely break from the manic city.||August 25, 2015
Julie O||50||Love Hyde Park. Good boating on the Serpentine or you can just while away the hours watching the roller skaters/dancers/skateboarders. Good café with excellent selection of food, drinks and ice cream||August 25, 2015
Diane F||50||Hyde Park is great for a stroll or play or 5 minutes peace. Its big enough for all, plus lots more. I see and find something different each time I visit.||August 25, 2015
shroppiefly||40||Never realised how large it is. We walked from St Pauls to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Had a lovely coffee at the restaurant on the edge of the Serpentine lake.Weather was glorious on our walk.Took photo's of Peter Pan and the Italian fountains.Well worth a visit.||August 25, 2015
rachelkutik||50||Great place to jog, swim, rent a paddle boat. eat, picnic, or just relax. Parts are very manicured, parts are more "wild" with longer grass and bigger trees. Around the pond, it can get busy. I liked some of the ins and outs of the paths in the more secluded areas. I jogged there alone every morning and never felt unsafe as there are always people around. If you're looking for a nice 5 mile jog, circle the edge of Hyde and Kensington parks.||August 25, 2015
Bernard1000000||50||a loverly couple of days in london , decided to take a stroll through hyde park , spotless no litter and more importanly no dog poo , at that point we happened to see the local ,well how can i put it dog poo warden his job, to collect any stray dog cack is name was ross he said he loved the job , but it was the smell that attracted him to the job , anyway if your looking for a dog poo free zone look no further than hyde park||August 24, 2015
Darknight2014||50||The beauty of the water with the ducks is amazing .. Very good place to relax ... Worth spending time with friends and family... best for small picnic outings..||August 24, 2015
Nancy T||40||Hyde Park is nothing special although it has a ferris wheel and kids play area. I didn't think it was worth seeing and disappointed in other parks around London.||August 24, 2015
Sarah H||50||Hyde park was right across from our hotel! It is a massive park and extremely busy on hot days! Lovely way to chill out for the evening or just to get some pictures! ||August 24, 2015
KSindt||40||The lawns were not maintained as well as they were when I was here 40+ years ago. It was fun to watch the swans in the park and the children playing.||August 24, 2015
thefosters001||50||This place is fantastic. You are in the centre of a metropolis listening to the birdsong! I actually think it could be quieter than Central Park.Make sure you either hire a Boris (Barclays/Santander) bike or one of the pedalos on the lake. If you can't, just chill out on a deckchair and take in the sights/sounds.And if you are sporty, why not splash out and buy a ball or frisbee as there is plenty of space to burn up those calories.TIP: Watch out, they do lock up at night, so don't get stuck!||August 24, 2015
rugaliyal||40||The biggest and the most famous park in London, though St James's park looks nicer to me. Serpentine lake is great. The fountain of the Princess Diana is strangely small and not impressive. Actually, anything related to Diana's name is made less impressive and intentionally put apart from royal family. That's a pity. You should visit speaker's corner - you can always find a crowd and a speaker there talking on any possible subject.||August 23, 2015
Steve S||50||Great place to walk around there is plenty of entertainment and food places within. It's a nice place to go and read on a sunny day.||August 23, 2015
drew1967I||40||HUGE park! Beautiful and very peaceful grounds, chairs to rest and enjoy your surroundings, place for children to safely run and burn up some energy, would be a great place for a picnic if so inclined||August 23, 2015
Samantha_Charles||40||Fantastic venue in central london. Busy on the weekends. Go whe the sun is shining. Take some food for the ducks (although not sure what ducks eat lol)||August 23, 2015
565esmab||50||This beautiful park is really big and spacious with many different things to see. I have so many great memories here that I will never forget. I definitely recommend everyone to come. I believe Hyde park is londons version of Central Park in New York. ||August 23, 2015
DaisyChain12||50||We enjoyed walking through here after a morning of shopping. There were arches we could walk through covered in flowers, beautifully planted borders, a boring lake and cafes to eat. It was a very warm sunny day and there were lots of people sitting enjoying the park. There were cyclists using the cycle lane and we also watched a roller blades doing fancy tricks around some cones. Glad we took time to have a wander.||August 23, 2015
Ben N||50||A beautiful respite from the rest of London. Lovely gardens, walks, and paths. There are a few cafes around to stop for a drink. Very very popular in Summer, especially on the weekends. Hire a bike and ride around!||August 22, 2015
michelleh413||40||Short day trip to London with a little time to kill before our train back. Let's go to Hyde park said the teenage son. Not the best weather wasn't really sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised, nice boating lake, nice gardens, loved watching the squirrels and the Santander bikes gave us an hours exercise before we headed home. Would like to visit again on a nicer day ||August 22, 2015
Catherine B||50||Spacious and clean Hyde Park really has something for everyone:Beautiful, well-tended flower beds catch your peripheral vision as you walk or ride around. Dazzling swans and geese claim their space alongside the boats on the lake. Boris bikes accelerate your pace around the Park. There are several docking stations within the Park.Paddling and rowing boats may appeal to the more energetic; while a mini-cruise boat is available for a more sedate trip around the lake.The two-part Serpentine Gallery is currently showing wonderful life-like work by Duane Hanson. A thriving volunteer-maintained allotment is a hidden oasis. Cafes to rehydrate and get a snack are scattered around the Park. Deck chairs are available to rest, reflect, enjoy sights and sounds; or simply be. Hyde Park is a centrally located peaceful attraction of simple pleasures for all! ||August 22, 2015
kiran_nisar||40||One of the beautiful park in London. Entry is free. Its really very big but well maintained. It has wonderful walking path, bicycle path. Good for thise who loves natural beauty||August 22, 2015
nirkules||50||A great place to take a break from the bustle of London. Wonderful walking paths, bicycling paths and greens. The ponds are full of geese and there are paddle boats for rent. The Princes Diana Memorial pplayground is full for the kids. ||August 21, 2015

alybob1||50||Had a lovely walk through the park, you didn't feel as though you were in London as it was fairly quiet. Stopped at the café to take in the view of the lake and birds.||August 21, 2015
joshiarun||40||A very nice park to have a walk/stroll/some lazying around.It is a big park with long roads.One wan enjoy some shallow water boating.Take some peanuts the large squirrels love them.You can feed them with your hand.It is just like one had been reading in English novels.||August 20, 2015
nathalie n||50||i was staying in the Bayswater area so the park was very close for me. I had not been in London for a long time and it was nice to get back, being there in May it was not that crowded. I enjoyed seeing the tribute to Princess Diana, having lunch on a bench and watching the swans swim by. The Serpintine is always very clean and relaxing..one can also go the see Kensington Palace. Love Hyde Park and you can cross thru to go to the V & A museum..||August 20, 2015
djmakinson||30||Replete with swans, trees and vagrants, Hyde Park (HP) is among the largest parks in the western hemisphere. With its open spaces and paths, HP provides even the most jaded Londoner with a chance to kick back, relax and enjoy a mediocre coffee for as little as £3.20. A boating lake provides a serene tableau for the meditative boulevardier to reflect upon. Vast plane trees sway in the breeze. Speaker's corner hums with hardline Islamism and the disconnected rantings of the quietly insane. Truly, Hyde Park is unique.||August 20, 2015
John_the_Cat||40||A wonderful park with a large expanse of water in the centre of London teeming with waterfowl. There was even a heron which still did not bother to move even when I was within 6ft of it. Having seen a multitude of herons, including regular visitors to my garden, where they have decimated my fish stocks, I have never got anywhere near to one as this. Plenty of happy boaters rowing or pedalling and a surprising number of runners who should be at work!A peaceful and pleasant swathe of green in the middle of busy London which locals must treasure||August 20, 2015
CatlondonUS||40||I love Hyde Park. It is often a bit too busy on sunny days but today it was slightly overcast and was just magnificent, I also recommend early morning walks through the park. The lark is great for families, with lots to see and do. It is very easy to spend hours here and wander round, have a picnic, people watch, visit the free attractions or ride bicycles. Transport is very accessible from points all around the park. Go see it. And take your kids if you have them.||August 20, 2015
kseley||50||Beautiful park. Wonderful trees. I loved the life like sculptures in the serpentine gallery. They were amazing.||August 20, 2015
landmark_jodi||50||A beautiful walk, unique sites throughout the park. Its great for people watching, picture taking, relaxing strolls and romantic sunsets. ||August 20, 2015
hadiabjwde||50||Me and my wife last week visited this park and we walked from the queen gate till kensington palace inside the park then to Diana memorial , we saw the lake of ducks then went to the serpentine and took a dinner in a restaurant , then afternoon we continue our walk to the end and saw Albert memorial and royal Albert hall. Took some pictures then went to the other End ( marble Arch ) and speaker corner. Then out the park to take the dinner near oxford street.It was a long happy Day we walked a lot but saw most of it, and it was great.Tips: we payed 17 pounds each to visit inside kensington palace.All the other places are free.||August 20, 2015
JasonMcfly||40||It really is hard to put into words just how MASSIVE Hyde Park is. Such a wonderfully magical park right in the middle of London. The grounds are kept very clean which makes this park even more majestic. Take a nice bike ride, walk, run, or just picnic under a tree. A lot of area to cover if you are looking to see the entire park. Another great feature is Kensington Palace is located in and around Hyped Park. Definitely a must while visiting the park.||August 20, 2015
martinn366||50||A great place for a morning walk, walk home from dinner or take a run. Suitable for picnics and stroller walks. ||August 20, 2015
Allgoodthyngs||50||No visit to London would be complete without a stroll through Hyde Park stroll though the trees along the water and get yourself pleasantly lost. Always plenty going on not just with the wildlife but the antics of people too. Maybe it's the animals watching us? LOLBring yourself here particularly on aSunday and speakers corner will surely keep you entertained with preachers and speakers that like to be heard.Extensive pathways and walking/boating activities to suit or you can just hire a deck chair and listen to the band munching your lunch and kicking back a little after the noise of the city.||August 20, 2015
Mp R||50||the hype park is amazing place in the sunny weather . the biggest place with green color amazing atmosphere , nice fresh air over it ||August 19, 2015
Eduardo S||50||What to say about Hyde Park? Nice place to go and spend an evening there.I would have loved to hire a bicycle, but the instructions weren't so clear. Maybe you are luckier.||August 19, 2015
helenmont18||50||A serene retreat right in the hustle and bustle of Central London! One can grab lunch at a number of pret-a-manger or Marks&Spencer stores nearby, and have a leisurely lunch right on the lawn. Playgrounds for the kids and places to exercise make it a good choice for a weekend morning pass time.||August 19, 2015
Kerry B||40||I love Hyde Park, I got to London about 3 times a year ofr business and i always try to visit Hyde park, there is something very relxing about it and in summer its a dream. There are always young people in the Park reaxling and its a rejuvinating place.||August 19, 2015
Marie B||50||Beautiful, our hotel was just across the street, wish we had gone there the first day, I'd have gone back every morning for a walk!||August 19, 2015

Steve D||40||Large park in the middle of London. Great for a quiet walk and for getting away from the hustle & bustle of the city. Lots of space for the kids to run around, also has the Princess Diana memorial playground & fountain again which the kids loved, large lake where you can hire a peddle boat and has a few eateries dotted around the park||August 19, 2015
antaninak||50||absolutely gorgeous to spend a weekend there, ride a boat, ride a bike, just walk around or lay on the grass. Very nice and relaxing.Besides, it's huuuge!!||August 18, 2015
Jade M||50||Hyde Park is a beautiful park and there is always something happening! We last visited for Winter Wonderland and found it to be far too busy and commercialised for our liking. We will keep our visits to lazy days in the summertime from now on!||August 18, 2015
Cenkmd||50||Extensive paths, meadows to explore next to Kensington Gardens and Place. We had a bite at the cafe on the Serpentine and watched people boat.||August 18, 2015
Raj S||50||Excellent location for experiencing many parts of London.Enjoy the park itself for nice long walks / cycle rides [especially using the TFL - Santander bikes for hire].Be careful *the deck chairs are chargeable**Pedalo on the lakes (Serpentine).Perfect for exploring the shops to the south in Kensington & the Natural History Museum.If available the Roof Gardens is a must do experience to the south west of the park.On the south east tip is Hyde Park corner & a large TFL bike stand - grab a bike here & enjoy the sights & sounds of Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Parliment Square, 10 Downing Street, etc - all within a 30-minute cycle tour.Acres of space to find your own quiet place for a picnic with friends / family / partner.Many sights & sounds are completely free to enjoy e.g. The Albert Memorial.Highly recommended!!||August 18, 2015
Gill68||50||A beautiful park with many things on offer. There are several dining options, both indoors and outside for breakfast and lunch. Many lovely gardens to explore with deckchairs for hire if the weather is good. The Serpentine Gallery was a nice diversion and free to visit. Overall a great way to spend some time away from the hustle and bustle of the city.||August 18, 2015
moody1955||50||Hyde Park is a large beautiful Park to walk. On Sundays one may spend hours enjoying the different opinions of people arguing about faith or politics or any other subjects.||August 18, 2015
Charlotta C||40||The park is lovely, huge lake and lots of open space for kids, dog walkers and people who come to reflect. Loved the rose garden and the Diana Memorial.||August 18, 2015
MaxEG||40||A beautiful park that is a must-see if you are in London for more than a few days. There is a nice pond with rent-able boats (pedal and rowboats) as well as a few food places. Close to many tube stations, it's just not right to visit Hyde Park when staying in London.||August 18, 2015
KimJ873||50|| Huge park in the middle of the city, nice views and lots of Places to relax and enjoy. A rich birdlife and Kensington Park and Palace next to ||August 18, 2015
helen m||40||Houses Kensington Palace, on the west side, the former home of Princess Diana, Take a stroll towards the Serpentine, visit the Serpentine gallery then under the bridge & have brunch, lunch at the cafe by the lake. Carry on along Rotten Row to the other side of the lake for dinner at the restaurant. When satisfied pop up to Marble arch for some shopping or down Piccadilly for tea at the Ritz, or into Soho for drinks.||August 18, 2015
Stoil P||50||Only for time losing place, to get there by foots / no good with own transport - to busy streets / and no parking place at all al round, but is quiet and nice peace of land. ||August 18, 2015
309jacquic||40||Next to Marble arch station is Hyde Park, with park Lane Heading South towards Victoria Station this is a great place to walk, run, cycle and people watch. Lovely Christmas market in December. On the north side of the park railing look at the art work on a Sunday morning. Admire the trees and stroll towards the the Albert Hall. Take a picnic and enjoy.||August 18, 2015
jrctourism||50||Hyde Park is a must if you visit London. It's huge and it connects with the Kensington Gardens and the Kensington Palace.The big lake in the middle is perfect for hiring a pedal boat in a sunny day.I cannot imagine a better place in London for having a pleasant walk.||August 17, 2015

21twilight||40||Walked through Hyde Park on our way to the Princess Diana Memorial - it was quite a walk and they have very little signage to direct you so there was a bit of a ramble. The park is beautiful and the views of the lakes were so lovely.||August 17, 2015
Jef3333||50||Beautiful, calm and tranquil in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of london. Its lovely to see Princess Diana's fountain as well.||August 17, 2015
Maire M||50||Hyde Park is iconic; you can't visit London without finding yourself wandering through Hyde park at some point. You can ride a horse along Rotten Row, hire a pedallo and head off across the Serpertine or just sit and watch the diving ducks.The Princess Diana memorial is here as are several children's playgrounds. You can even swim in the Serpentine!There's Speaker's Corner, great on a Sunday, various festivals/ parades, a great rose garden. Look out for plaques commemerating various events. If you need refreshment there are 2 cafes and a few kiosks. Or cross over the road to the Sackler Gallery and cafe.||August 17, 2015
kim3887||50||lovely place to relax on a deck chair or to walk around will go again you wouldn't think you were in the middle of London||August 17, 2015

Dyce0030||50||It's nice to cycle around the park on a sunny day using one of the Santander Bikes. The park is small enough to avoid getting charged for the bike if you're fast enough!||August 17, 2015
Simon B||50||A year round treasure within London. Hyde Park is a large area of open space with a range of lakes and other features that provide a level of tranquility not found in many other parts of London. Much to see and do. Children love the boat rides on the Serpentine Lake (itself offering good photo opportunities of the London skyline) as well as the Diana Memorial Fountain (bring a towel and walk around it - this is encouraged)Many people use the cycle scheme to ride around the park - a great way to explore the 350 or so acres of park. For the more athletic there are wide areas of paths and tracks to jog along.The location of the park is great too. Accessible by tube and bus from all sides, the park is used by both tourists and Londoners alike. We have visited the park on numerous occasions in all seasons and the impact of weather on visitor numbers is minimal - it really is an all year round park.December sees a large area of the park taken over by the Winter Wonderland. This is a wonderful (but can be pricey) mix of market and entertainment (rides mainly) with a fantastic feel and atmosphere. The park also hosts a number of open air concerts (many free) throughout the year - including amongst others The Proms!Whilst not perhaps one to visit if on a tight time schedule, those with a little time to spare will not be disappointed by a visit to this lovely park.||August 17, 2015
mcesar2015||50||It's the most known park in London and it has several interesting points: the Crystal Palace, he Art Gallery (Serpentine), the lake (with boats to rent) and all the walks and beautiful trees. It is really nice in all seasons. In sunny days many people go there for sunbathing. I love walking there and also bringing a book with me and staying there reading. here is a restaurant and small kiosks where you can have a meal. It has a Diana's memorial and a kids park near it.||August 16, 2015
Tucsondiego||50||We spent a fair amount of time in the park, walking, snacking and generally people watching. Lots of wonderful dogs and people enjoying their weekend. We especially enjoyed the Memorial to Lady Diana, the Serpentine and the Birdwatcher's Cottage. Huge trees and lovely gardens-relatively uncrowded.||August 16, 2015
Olga C||50||It is a gem of London and a very well kept place. I do not have a lot of green in Cyprus, so we enjoyed hours on end in Hyde park, all those lush green meadows, trees, ponds, etc. A big thanks to the park keepers! My son loved the playground, too.||August 16, 2015
Siobhan B||50||It is so peaceful to walk through, seeing the peter pan statue, ponds with ducks, swans and other wildlife. Then you get to the other side to the Diana memorial and it's amazing to see, don't expect it to be quite in the summer. Diana loved Kids and I'm sure she would love to see all the kids playing in the water having fun, had a laugh standing back watching all the kids and some adults having fun. ||August 16, 2015
jennideee||50||In 2008 me and my father was there, it was novdmber-decdmber and they had a winter Wonderland with ice skating, ferris wheel and lots of beautiful Christmas decorations. This made the park pretty both day and night! Absolutely a "to do" thing in London! ||August 16, 2015
jessyelle||40||Pretty park with lots to do whether it be sports, picnic or a walk. Good just-off central location to London and close to underground stations for convenience. ||August 16, 2015
McWett||50||From speakers corner to the serpentine you can walk, relax, sit and be amazed by how this great piece of land is here for everyone. Surrounded by all that is London here is where families go to picnic or play, where lovers walk hand in hand, where people come to sit under a tree and read or just take a relaxing stroll. Flowers, giant trees, sculptures, a lake to rent a paddle boat and expanses of green grass make this one of the more active parks in London.||August 16, 2015
framboise_blues||50||There are so many paths to choose from, you can literally take a different path each day for a whole year. While sometimes the main road will have horse dung (due to the policemen on horses...), the park is generally quite clean. On weekends, its usually filled with families just chilling on the grass. Its best to go in the late afternoon for jogging, as it can be quite chilly in the mornings.||August 16, 2015
fe d||40||The park is beautiful well maintained Park. Making it perfect for a picnic. There's are not to many children's play areas but there are plenty of sculptures to get interested in. The main aspect of the park is that the paths are well maintained giving the park access for those who use a wheelchair and other walking aids.||August 16, 2015
John R||40||Got to Harrods at 9:15am to find it opens at 10am so walked to nearby Hyde Park. It was a pleasant day so walked around the lake watching the many geese, ducks and swans resting by the side or swimming in the lake. Free toilets at the Lido were a welcome break and the joggers, cyclists, roller skaters kept us on our toes as we meandered around the lake. Boat hire was expensive so wasn't tempted.||August 15, 2015
debbied442||50||During our recent stay in London I chose our hotel because it was close to the tube and a park. One of the best decisions I made for this trip! We had warm weather ( a pleasant surprise for a spring visit:) and the park was a perfect place to enjoy it. There is so much to see and do I'm not sure where to begin. There are an abundance of memorials (including the newest one to Diana) to scope out. The are plenty of signs and maps so you can figure out where you are. The lawns are expansive, the pathways wide and well maintained, lots of gardens and blooms, trees for shade, bikes to rent and nooks and crannies to explore. We spent time exploring and enjoying during our stay. Also made a point of walking thru the park instead of the city sidewalks when venturing else where and the route hit along the park. Highly recommend enjoying this historic London asset when in the city. Hard to tell there is a major city outside the park boundaries when you're inside. Several tube stops get you there.||August 15, 2015
Nan F||40||For walking, biking, people-watching, this is the largest offering in London. I have been there a few times and still only seen a small fraction of it. Located near many wonderful restaurants which you'll want to visit after working up an appetite. We liked the ones in Mayfair.||August 15, 2015
petrag813||50||Great huge park with lake, lots of nice restaurants, beautiful garden, Princess Diana fountain which is great fun for the kids, bring swimming suit and towel.||August 15, 2015
dadaforcks||50||We had a beautiful London weather at noon when we ate our lunch here at the Playground. We bought our lunch from Harrods and ate lunch while my 5 y/o played with other kids in the playground. Just perfect day in London amidst the tube strike!||August 15, 2015
Holiday_Junkie222||50||Hyde park is a fantastic park to visit and whether you want to lie in the sun and read a book or walk around the lake, it makes a very good family trip out.||August 15, 2015
Rebecca B||50||On a glorious summers day in london i had a couple of hours with a friend. Instead of doing coffee we decided to walk around Hyde Park and experience the pedalos on the Hyde Park serpentine which was loads of fun. Would highly recommend this experience - bit pricey but fun anyway ||August 15, 2015
AlleyGator2142||50||A very enjoyable afternoon visit to enjoy the many attractions in the park. Whether you want to run around with your kids, cycle around the park, go boating or even ride a horse, there is plenty to do there.Be advised it is quite a large park and can be tiring over a long period, especially with young active kids||August 15, 2015
Travelingpianoman||40||When you get overwhelmed or exhausted in London, this is a great place to take a break. It is clean and beautiful and a great place to have a picnic style lunch. We used it as a place to allow our one year old son to run around and to relax a bit.||August 14, 2015
Kaaps||50||I'm a city park fan.However, Hyde Park London is where it all started for me and what a start.Go there, roam around, fall asleep in the sun, hire a bike and ride around, amble back. In other words, enjoy a few hours of woken dream.||August 14, 2015
Pauline_Rowney||50||Having decided to escape the morning rush hour on the tube I decided to take a cross park walk from Marble Arch to the Natural History Museum. It turned out to be one of the most enjoyable times I spent in London. The cafes and walkways alongside the Serpentine are beautiful. The plantings, wildlife and monuments - including the Princess Diana memorial - the pedalos and children's play areas were an unexpected pleasure. There are deckchairs for those who wish to picnic on the grass and benches line the walkways. You have no inkling of the busy city around the park. London is so very busy nowadays this is a lovely sanctuary for visitors and certainly helped me recharge my batteries.||August 14, 2015
chris2pher62||40||We spent a few hours on a sunny afternoon here. It's like an oasis in the middle of a very busy city. We hired a deck chair and just ready the papers. It was a nice contrast to the busier tourist spots.||August 14, 2015
UK_12345678||40||Relaxed by the beautiful Italian Gardens one sunny afternoon (Lancaster Gate entrance). Lovely views of flowers, fountains, greenery. Busy but still feels quiet and calm. Nice just soaking up the sun and people watching.||August 14, 2015

LondonBenelliott||30||This area of the park seems to have been taken over by wealthy families of the far east. The eating house is very popular and nice in the summer with good outside space. Lots of activities and amenities along the Serpentine. Beware of bikes and skaters on busy days.||August 13, 2015
Mcgee8275||40||Hyde park was a nice quiet spot that we were able to pick a spot under some trees and enjoy take away picnic style. The landscaping was beautiful in case you like taking pictures of scenery and the ducks were a good distraction for the kids.||August 13, 2015
Squashie56||50||Summer in London - you will find the parks full of people. All the parks. Get a sandwich or something at a Pret-a-Manger, find a nice spot, and enjoy one of the many parks.Hyde Park itself has much to offer. There are paddle boat rentals for the Serpentine, horseback riding, crowded areas, and secluded areas. There are areas where the grass and other veg are left to grow wild (these I've seen more in the northeast but not all the way east in the park section). There are very cultivated sections like the Italian Fountains. ||August 13, 2015
Swanlaik||50||The park is really amazing. Too big & seats everywhere so you can set for a while a lone. Very nice for walking & have fun with young children & enjoyment!! You must go. ||August 13, 2015
AlexiVenice||40||Lovely place to exercise and mingle with the London residents. Early morning brings out the dog walkers and it's a blast to see them running through the park.||August 13, 2015
paul o||50||The park is great for sightseeing with so many separate areas like the Italian gardens, the picturesque Serpentine and Diana's play area for the children. There are quite a few cafes and facilities located at convenient locations within the park. A great way to spend an afternoon.||August 13, 2015
J0seyWhales||40||.....and relaxing. Good place to eat & drink, not cheap but not overly expensive. Plenty of places to have a picnic if the weather is fine, so if your'e on a budget that's probably best. Nice walks as well - London's answer to Central Park..... try and combine your visit when there is a show / concert in the Park.....now that really is something.||August 13, 2015
Athene W||40||The park is well maintained, where the grass is perfect on a nice day for picnic. The paths through the park are also well maintained providing excellent access for those who use wheelchairs and other walking devices. Not to many children's play areas but has lots of sculptures to look at and get interested in. ||August 13, 2015
peter d||50||A sense of history in the air, walking through Hyde park is a subtle sensation, I can't think of a nicer stroll then along the Serpentine.Having a cup and a ale at the Lido and then go out for whatever place you like, Harrods,Oxford Circus,Buckingham Palace all to be reached in a 15mi stroll.How nice the London cabs,busses and underground might be, this is the best (and healthy)way to reach above mentioned destinations.||August 12, 2015
Sparklehorse68||40||This and Kensington Gardens are really lovely for a walk around though if you are not from London do remembered that they are very large parks which many exits so take note of wher you entered the park or you could get a little disorientated. There are cafes and restaurants which deck chairs available to rent. ||August 12, 2015
Jodi V||50||Hyde Park is a fantastic, shady, huge and picturesque park in central London that is a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the city. It is an easy walk from Harrod's, so we brought all our fun food hall purchases here (several bags worth!) for a leisurely picnic. The walk from Harrod's is not far but a little challenging to figure out - from the Knightsbridge tube area, point yourself towards the park (north) and look for the walkways under/between the buildings that line Knightsbridge Rd. (looks like these show up on Google maps, watch the locals too). Through the walkway and across another road and you're at the southern end of Hyde Park, near the Serpentine lake - couldn't ask for a better picnic spot! There is also a playground on this end of the park - we were going to walk up to the Princess Diana playground (technically Kensington Park but connected), but this playground ended up being a place that the kids were quite content to stay at for a while.||August 12, 2015
Roamingtheworld||40||We visited Hyde Park on the last day, and loved the laid-back, family atmosphere. You could rent bikes or paddle boats, or just hike the grounds. Lots of nice paths, and side areas of interest like the Princess Diana memorial pool. You could also loop around to see Kensington Palace. The small lake in Hyde Park has a swim area, but it is not a beach, and you pay to enter it. Showers and changing facilities are part of what you pay for, but in the early part of July, the water was still quite chilly according to our sons. Also, be aware that there can be a topless sunbather or two, which our sons quickly noticed and then quickly pretended not to:)Hyde Park is worth a visit, and would be an excellent picnic spot if you are looking for one. ||August 12, 2015
Almuth M||50||If you like people watching or roller blading or both this is the park for you! The memorial play ground a treat for kids. Food in cafes lousy and over priced,take a picnic! ||August 12, 2015
Abdelrahmanelkot||40||Its always nice to go there for a walk, or for a picnic. Also, next to the Serpentine gallery, there is the Serpentine pavilion which gets designed every year by a different architect, and its a great experience to go there and have a coffee because these pavilions are usually amazing. There is also the Magazine Restaurant which was designed by architect Zaha Hadid, and right next to it is the serpentine sackler gallery which also have many interesting exhibitions. http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/serpentine-pavilion-2015||August 12, 2015
Vicky1985rj||50||A really lovely day out just walking around Hyde park- a romantic long walk that can cost very little except train fares and lunch, other than that perfect walk in the park. The flower gardens are beautiful and if u want something else to do as well nothing is far off a walk or a jump on the train.||August 12, 2015
haley_tw||50||On a sunny day this place is a must. The scenery is beautiful and there is so much to do from boating on the lake, walking the Diana memorial, renting bikes or rollerblading. Not to mention all of the activities that don't cost. Had a picnic here on a sunny Saturday, could not have been happier. Just be aware of where the nearest toilet is!||August 12, 2015
Anthony T||50||On our last full day in London, we were on our way home and a random lady struck up a conversation with my daughter and her mother on the tube, suggesting that based on our next stop we visit Hyde Park to see the swans. This wasn't even on our radar, but we thought "why not?" We had some trouble finding this attraction, though it is an enormous city park. We got off at the Notting Hill tube station, then took the bus in the general direction of Hyde Park, not sure where to stop. We got off the bus basically giving up, and the Park happened to be basically right there. We wandered around in the park and happened upon a children's park, then past that some fountains, which were adjacent to a lake with... swans! We followed the lake for a while and found... all the swans! We also found a cafe/restaurant where we ate dinner. On the way out of the park, we found a visitor appearing to be feeding birds. Turns out there are parrots indigenous to the park. He lent us some nuts, and before long we had parrots eating out of our hands. What a wonderful side trip. Highly recommended. ||August 12, 2015

rachellou94||40||while visiting london were were visiting both buckingham palace and kensington palace and rather that sitting on a hot stuffy bus or underground we decided to walk even though it was quite a distance (for me who is not a walking person) usually a distance that far i would be lazy and get the bus. i am so glad i walked through the park it was lovely the views and the weather which was warm and sunny. i don't think it would be quite so nice if it was raining. i do however wish there was some sort of map of sign as i had to reply on an app on my phone to direct me through the park to kensington palace.||August 12, 2015
636aggelikig||50||An amazing place for a walk, a run, a ride on a pedal boat or just some peace and quiet. I could definitely spend the whole day there. ||August 12, 2015
AMF3||40||Beautiful park with plenty of space for picnics, walking, riding or just hanging around. They offer horseback riding but need to make reservations in advance. They do have rental bikes but most are spoken for. There are also bike tours that you can take.||August 12, 2015
Tayla J||50||I went to winter wonderland 2014 - AMAZING so magical and would get anyone into the Christmas spirit!! rides for all ages food for all tastes ( from all different countries/ sweet carts)lots of beer/ mulled wine stores all so christmasy! a bit of a German market type thingreally pretty at night and open till late overall great experience will defiantly be going back again this year!||August 12, 2015
thesteevesgroup||40||The park was good but it was kinda out of our way. We actually did not plan on going there but was walking to Kensington Palace and saw the park and walked around a bit.I would not put it on my to do list, however.||August 11, 2015
Laura_TravelTheWorld||40||Very nice park in the middle of the city. The area around the lake is beautiful. I can especially recommend the Serpentine Pavillon. ||August 11, 2015
Mel C||50||Be sure to visit here for a day, take a picnic, relax in the deck chairs and just take it easy. Take a boat ride or rollerblade here. Sunday morning is especially good if you want to go to Speaker's Corner and here all the debating of free speech. This park is great for couples, families, so much to do or to just do nothing except relax.||August 11, 2015
Geographic_educator||50||A beautifully treed haven in the middle of London, Hyde Park is a tranquil yet majestic park well worth a visit. The magnificent Albert Memorial, serene Serpentine with elegant swans, and the respectful Princess Diana Memorial fountain replete with families enjoying themselves, make this one of the most beautiful parks in London. Enjoy this quiet retreat from the busy streets that surround it.||August 11, 2015
purnimafoodie||40||Hyde park is place for those to be visited who like to sit in peace with their loved ones and spend some quality time....||August 11, 2015
Emily Gramos G||50||Even in vacation, one does feel the need to rest, take a nap, read... Hyde Park is a giant park, where families go to spend the day; having picnics, feeding the ducks, sleeping, talking... That was an experience we shared. Beautiful park. Go to the restroom before and don't leave your kids alone because it's huge and trust me you DON'T want to get lost there.....||August 10, 2015
S_Forder||50||Visit the park by bike allows you to get around between the different bike rental stations. You can also ride down hill all the way from Queensway station entrance via the serpentine and Green Park to Buck Palace and Trafalgar square. Highlights of the park include the serpentine and gardens nearby, the Princess Diana memorial fountain (this is designed for kids and big kids to paddle in), the Serpentine Gallery and summer pavilions. Hyde Park links to Kensington Gardens and the beautiful fountains near Lancaster gate and lady Diana memorial Children's playground (adults only allowed with children). this park can take an hour or a day but does close at midnight.||August 10, 2015
Joan T||40||hyde Park is a nice place to hang out. Big, green, close to stores and sights. You can walk through Hyde Park to get to Kennsigton Place. It's across from Buckingham Place too. So, it your shopping, or sight seeing and you need a place to take a break, Hyde Park is great.||August 10, 2015
Halsmind||40||The park may not contain some outstanding monument but the atmosphere there is quite fanstatic: you will always find some place to play football or badmington without bothering your neighbours or laying on the grass to take a small nap between two visits. I didn't visit so many park so large and so peacefull.||August 10, 2015
Rosa D||50||The first time I visited Hyde Park, 15 years ago, I fall in love!! Little I knew that I will end up working and leaving so close to it that I could visit every day!! I still in love with the park and it hearts me when I see people mistreating the plants and animals. It's not very often but it happens. The Park is beautifully well kept. They clean every day, all day! The Park is too busy during weekends. If you would like to enjoy the park, visit early in the morning. It's a beautiful place to go running or for long walks. I just would like people to stop visiting, so I can have it for myself!! he, he. Very selfish I know ;) I just wish every Park in every city would resemblance to Hyde Park. For me is the best Park in the world!||August 10, 2015
Oliver H||30||Hyde Park is a great quite contrast to the buzzing cityscape around it, although that is all that it tends to offer. Apart from being a perfect location to host the numerous concerts and festivals that occur rather frequently, Hyde Park is one of the lesser parks in London. I would advise you walk through if you are in the area, yet, don't visit Kensington purely for it. ||August 10, 2015
Midlotrails||40||I was their early on a Sunday morning to run and they were having a big 10k Race for Breast Cancer. This park has a huge lake and offers many activities and also soft surfaces for those that do not like to run on pavement. Enjoy!||August 10, 2015
greggjc||40||lovely setting for a variety of purposes ... it isn't New York's Central Park by any means, but lots to do - boating, catamarans, sitting, walking, roller blading, cycling etc - very pleasant gardens, nice atmosphere on a sunny lovely day||August 10, 2015
R_Riddle||40||At the heart of the City the Park is a great way to avoid the crowded streets. We were able to rent the readily available Boris Bikes to navigate from attraction to attraction with ease.||August 10, 2015
W13_and_beyond||50||Two large arches (Marble and Wellington), a huge lake (Serpentine) with boating and cafe overlooking, cheap open air swimming (the lido), one ridiculously huge gold monument (the Albert), an Italianate formal garden, children's play areas, a palace, water based memorials to princesses plus trees grass and ice cream! Why go anywhere else?||August 9, 2015
MikeR03||50||Beautiful park with many different paths! They offer bikes for those who would rather travel on wheels instead of heels, although not all paths are open to bikes. The park was very much alive with music and street vendors all going on. Pretty little pond where you can go and have a nice picnic near by. Very clean also! ||August 9, 2015
hsasmith||50||This place is great for a walk and to get away from the hussel and bussel. The flower garden was nice and there is plenty of grass if you just want to sit and watch the world go by.||August 9, 2015
mad_nassos||50||This is a great park, almost in the centre of London. I am a big fan; if I moved to London, I would really want to find a place near Hyde Park! There are interesting neighbourhoods and places of interest near Hyde Park. Some years ago, I was lucky enough to be offered a place for free (for 20 days) in Bayswater (5 minutes on foot), so every day, instead of using the subway, I would go to the park and walk to the other side. In any case, if you need to use the subway, there are a couple of stations in the East part (Marble Arch in North-East and Hyde Park Corner in South-East). On the other hand, if you want to take Oxford street, it literally starts in the North-East part of Hyde Park.||August 9, 2015
kathy b||50||The serpentine has boat hiring facilities, rowing or peddling. The busy restaurant was efficient. Hire bikes are in abundance. Deck chairs left for anyone to sit either in the sun or in the shade and free! The Princess Diana memorial fountain was amazing and in full use by the children. Loved the Princess Diana walk through the park. ||August 9, 2015
SamVDB2||50||This is one of the cleanest parks I've ever visited. Great place for whenever you want a place to eat your lunch, go for a walk or run. The park is enormous and also has playgrounds for kids.||August 9, 2015
weregypsies||40||Great green space in the city. Walking distance from the Science, V&A and Natural History Museum(s) so it's great for a picnic. Lots of space to walk and relax. The playgrounds are pretty much designed for little kids. There is one that has a large ship that is ok for older kids. However, it was pretty crowded so try to go at an... off-peak time?? If possible!||August 8, 2015
ELENA511||50||A fresh breath in the very heart of the city.You can enjoy a whole day being there for free.There are little squirrels as well.||August 8, 2015
Aakriti_J||50||I was staying 2 mins from hyde, would walk there in the evenings. It was peaceful green and oh so serene. Totally worth to pack a picnic basket n go there for a day.||August 7, 2015
seek_save||50||Hyde Park was a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the city, and gave a chance to just slow down for a while and stare at the swans. A great place to watch the people as much as the wildlife, make sure you plan for a couple hours to just leisurely stroll or use as a rest stop during your city walk||August 7, 2015
E11i3||50||An all year round park great for picnics, walks, runs, letting off steam or simply getting some fresh air. The park is so big you often see groups having sports or gatherings, couples on a date or young families feeding the many ducks. With great access by bus or tube it's a must for anyone visiting LondonYou can easily spend all day here!||August 7, 2015
437karin_||50||The best thing about Hyde park is that you can " hide" from crazy life. It is so peaceful, you can walk by the water, chill out, you can eat or sleep in the grass and nobody cares. IT is great location to take a break from London life||August 7, 2015
Chris S||50||Come on! this is!........This is London.Anyone coming to our city has to appreciate this. Our people already do. If not, please go away...............very sad!!||August 6, 2015
Kel H||40||Tons to see, rain or shine. View Princess Diana's Fountain, stroll the ponds and endless trails. If you want variety of sights and a taste of urban wildlife, this is it. Try going at different times of the day as the scenery changes with the light.||August 6, 2015
LarryR86||50||Through a mix-up with our bus we wound up walking though the park from bottom to top to get to our hotel. It was a sunny day (yes, even London has these) and the temp was ideal. Almost all the trails are paved and the lake was filled with water fowl and small boats. Bikes were everywhere. When we were driven to our hotel we went by the full extent of the park length-wise and a 5K or pink-colored walk was going on that followed us all the way to Speaker's Corner. Beautiful site.||August 6, 2015
Felipe D||50||The park is huge and beautiful. It has several spots to chill, practice sports and even swim in summer time.||August 6, 2015
seveng_ly||50||I was there in November and they set up the so called "winter wonderland". You can find food and beverages such as bavarian sausage (wurst), pretzel, french fries and different kinds of beer. There were many booths selling jewelry, hand crafts, magnets and whatnot. You can relax around the lake and watch the sun set or plan a picnic at the park.||August 6, 2015
Ruth D||50||We took two portable chairs to sit in the park and had a lovely warm afternoon watching the world go by. Was a fab place for people watching. We also paid a visit to the memorial of the 7/7 bombings and were moved by the feeling walking through it.||August 5, 2015
Lisa G||40||Lots of things to see, lovely cafe, friendly squirrels, Kensington Palace and Gardens, Diana Memorial and Playground.||August 5, 2015
tldawes||50||A beautiful park! We rented bikes from the park rentals, very very easy to rent (compared to Paris velo). The park is so beautiful and relaxed. Well worth a 1/2 day. You can go to Kensington Palace as well. There is a beautiful memorial fountain for Princess Diana. One of our favourite days in London. ||August 5, 2015
BC0313||50||Whether you seek a peaceful stroll, a place to jog, shade from the heat, or the perfect picnic place Hyde Park is the place. Water and grass mixed with flowers and trees create an area where everyone can find that special place just to be.||August 5, 2015
Emily B||50||Hyde Park is massive and beautiful. The lake is lovely, as is the Serpentine Café next to it. Although pricey, this was a nice place to have a snack and a drink watching the sunset over the river. There are a few places along the edge of the park to hire a Boris Bike, and hiring is easy, just follow the instructions on the computer system. It is £2 per half an hour. If you return within 30 minutes it is free, so have a short cycle, return the bike, have a picnic, and then pick up another bike for 30 minutes and you wont have to pay at all! A beautiful park, and often events on so check that out online too.||August 5, 2015
Bec456||50||Will never forget hiring a bike and riding around Hyde Park so ecstatic to be in London! A must for anyone's first time to England. ||August 4, 2015
SarahT959||50||Loved Hyde park, could have spent all day there. The squirrels are very friendly. Tip: buy some nuts, the squirrels will sit on your knee for a snack :)||August 4, 2015
Patti24||40||Huge park with lots of paths. The gardens are lovely and there's lots of things to see and do including playgrounds, biking, horseback riding and jogging. ||August 4, 2015
Judith M||50||We rode through this park on Boris Bikes and really enjoyed it despite it being so busy. However there were places in the park where we couldn't go on bikes but it didn't stop our enjoyment.||August 4, 2015
Neha W||40||We had the chance to experience Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. Lovely except that it got v v cold at night obviously (december). The food joints inside the fair were brilliant - tried the hot and juicy hot dogs. During the day the Hyde park is serene and refreshing.||August 3, 2015
Jeanne A||50||Winter wonderland! What a great time with plenty of things to eat as well as rides and attractions. At might the lights make it magical. ||August 3, 2015
david1892||50||plan a trip here if you want to relax and have some time out.many people just run,walk,sit or even have a pinic.the Diana memorial is here and is great during the summer months.||August 3, 2015
Abidshaz||50||Lovely Huge park. Edgeware road is nicely located near the speakers corner which is useful for the local shops and foot outlets.||August 3, 2015
Bruno P||50||I've lived in London for about one year. During this year, I must have been to Hyde Park like 15 times. Sometimes I went there because I wanted to walk, sometimes skate, take photos, go to a concert, etc. In general, it's an amazing place to go with family or by yourself. You take approximately 2-3 hours to see everything by foot.||August 3, 2015
fetchmypony||50||beautiful on a sunny day, a really relaxing place to visit. Remember to take some food for all the birds! ||August 3, 2015
KunderaRoma||50||If you are in London during the beginning of the summer, you can't loose this event. it is already three years i am attending to the music festival, watching live Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath and this year The Who with so many other support popular bands. The festival is open to every age and family. A lot of restaurant inside the area and funny little events makes this experience unique and enjoyable for all. If you could efford it, I deeply suggest to buy tickets for the restricted area, if you like to live the concert very close to the stage, if not enjoy the folk and be sure that the music will reach you everywhere in the park... of course we are in Hyde Park folks. ||August 3, 2015
Dencroft||50||My husband and myself went to this park yesterday (Sunday 2nd August) it was a lovely summers day and plenty of people milling around. We thought the park was clean and very well maintained and lots of lovely planting.Plenty of things to do walking around the serpentine, hire a boat or pedalo or have something to eat/drink in the restaurant.It's amazing how quite it feels away from the hussel and bustle of the city.||August 3, 2015
TravellingBoneDoctor||50||Hyde Park is one of our favourite parks in London. we enjoy walking and renting bicycles there. the views of the lakes and greens are amazing. ||August 3, 2015
Gary D||50||Great place to go for a stroll and a couple of drinks. There's always something going on ; and at times to join in with. It's a great place to just sit to one side and watch the world go by. Hyde park itself its an all round beautiful place to go.||August 3, 2015
Darlene M||50||I read elsewhere that not visiting Hyde Park while in London would be like going to New York and not visiting Central Park and that is a fair comment. It is a huge park with so much - the Serpentine river, the gardens, etc. There is a ferris wheel on one end right now that adds to the fun for kids of any age. I run in the early morning and I am always delighted to find a park that is not closed early in the morning (which I experienced in Paris - Luxembourg Gardens, for example, does not open until 7:45am - by then I am back in my room, getting ready to have breakfast with my family). I am thankful to London for creating and maintaining so many beautiful green spaces that are so accessible.||August 3, 2015
RobynR||50||Walking through Hyde Park with time to spare is the best way to see such a magnificent place. Sitting and watching the world go by is a must as well as visiting every corner of the park and enjoying what's there to see and do.||August 2, 2015
lesleyannefinlayson||50||a beautiful park. Feed the birds, take a stroll or punt in a boat.Look out for special events and concerts. The famous winter wonderland at Christmas||August 2, 2015
rrumakanthan||40||Very good and a large park and very nice to go with family, friends or alone.Many activities for children and adults e.g.cycling,boating or just for picnic.A must visit place for first time London visitors.Pack your eats and have a picnic ,if weather permits.Close to Oxford street is very convenient both for shopping and eating.||August 2, 2015
Ewyena||50||However I live in Greater London, but almost every year I found time to spend a half day there if weather allows. Great place to lie down on a blanket, or sit on a bench, run, ride a bike, dog-walking, family picnic,skating Summertime used to be crowded a bit, depends on weather, and used to have events, concerts, etc. Too huge to find tame squirrels to feed. To discover and walk around needs lots of time. Inside of the park is unbelievable that it is in the middle of a noisy metropolis.. if someone visits London, good to have a short walk in the park.||August 2, 2015
AyoubW||30||I used to love this place.. unfortunately, the grass area close to the lake has become very dirty !! the grass is drying up .. and full of cigarette butts all over the place, that you need something to sit on. And if you have a baby who like to crawl - good luck. I noticed that they are now renting some wooden sun beds/seats, I hope that this doesn't become the solution for keeping the place filthy like this! There's a nice restaurant at the lake that you may try .. much better than sitting on the park floor. If you're looking for real park experience, I'd suggest to go to another cleaner venue. Very dissappointed||August 2, 2015
sheepygold||50||Hyde Park itself is great but for a full day of free entertainment...Start at Notting Hill Gate tube and walk 5 minutes east towards Queensway. Before you get to Kensington Gardens turn right down Kensington Park Gardens to see the most magnificent houses in London. Keep going south until you pass Kensington Palace on your left. Turn left by the palace and enter Kensington Gardens. Head straight on (east) until you get to the Broad Walk then head diagonally left until after a minute or so you get to the small round pond which is a lovely place to feed the ducks and watch the world go by. Head back towards Kensington Palace but head towards the north (right hand side). Of course you can visit the palace but if you do not make sure you see the small but magnificent formal sunken garden and consider taking tea in the Orangery (expensive though).If you have young children make a detour north for a 5 minute walk to the amazing adventure playground otherwise head South towards Kensington High Street and when you get towards the end of the Broadwalk turn left (east) and walk along the path which is usually bordered by nice flowers. Keep on going till you get to the Albert Memorial and Albert Hall and then onward till you get to the road that bisects the park. Turn left and after a short distance you will get to the Serpentine Gallery where you may catch an exhibition.If you are feeling fit you can head left to the path along the Serpentine and turn left towards Lancaster Gate and pass the famous statue of Peter Pan before reaching the Italian Gardens with lovely fountains. Continue on the path around the far side of the Serpentine passed the Henry Moore sculpture and when you reach the road again that bisects the park get back up onto it cross it and also the bridge back over the Serpentine and head left along the Serpentine towards the Diana Fountain. Nearby there is also the Serpentine Lido if you fancy a swim. If not continue East until the end of the Serpentine for at least a look at the 1960s Brutalist? architecture of the Serpentine restaurant (it is a bit disappointing but a great place to sit). If you go further around you can also hire a row boat.Head south towards Knightsbridge untl you get to the cinder track where you may be lucky enough to spot some soldiers on horses and then left towards Hyde Park Corner. There are some lovely rose gardens just before you reach HPC.On a Sunday morning you can make a detour North towards Marble Arch to experience Speaker's Corner but not if you are of a religious persuasion and easily offended.Otherwise head under the Subway (Apsley House is REALLY worth a visit) and across the centre of Hyde Park Corner (you can also visit the Arch) as well as see the war memorial nearby. Head into Green Park and wander across on any path you like enjoying the peace and tranquility towards Buckingham Palace (also REALLY worth a visit when open during the summer). Finally head into St James's Park opposite the Palace and wander round the lake. The bridge in the middle is a great place for a photo. The best flower beds are at the far end as well as the Pelicans if you are lucky.You will end up near Horseguards Parade so are within 5 minutes walk of Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, Cabinet War Rooms, The Banqueting House, Trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey, National Gallery...............||August 1, 2015
GarfieInFowey||50||Lovely place. Especially liked the Italian gardens absolutely beautiful. Also the rose gardens are amazing. Whilst in the park it doesn't feel like you're in a city. So well kept too.||August 1, 2015
bumblebeegirl2015||50||I loved the italien garden and the serpentines where I went paddling. In all the park was beautiful and a very good place both for relaxation, walking and exercising.||August 1, 2015
yobar41||40||You can't be in London without go there. It like to travel NY and not visit central park.Be carefull if you go for morning run at rainy days. You don't have place to hide...It is very lovely park at good weather. ||August 1, 2015
Hizkuntza||50||One of the fav spots in London. I would suggest any traveler to get off Hyde Park (tube station or bus) and then walk all the way through the Serpentine Gallery. Near the lake, lot's of locals take sun bathing in a peculiar very londony way. There's an icea cream parlor nearby too. Finish at the Serpentine, where major and fantastic displays of ephimeral architecture are built every Summer.||July 31, 2015
BsrYsn||50||I have been there too long time ago with my friends.. So that was an amazing.. If you go to London any time absolutely you must be there and walk around the lake.. ||July 31, 2015
cp_0010||40||Hyde Park is centrally located in the heart of London. There is a nice lake inside. Park is huge and nice for a stroll on summer evenings . There are many cafes around. Easily accessible to Oxford Street, Regent street, Marble Arch on one side and Bayswater road on the other side. ||July 31, 2015
James R||40||What can i say, it's a beautiful park. Nice for a walk or a chill in the summer weather. There is a nice lake called the Serpentine, and has many nice cafe's.||July 30, 2015
Peter2868||50||We had a wonderful stroll through Hyde Park from Knightsbridge to Mayfair. What a great slice of London! We especially enjoyed the Serpentine Lake where people relaxed in chaises, kids chased the geese and dogs trotted along the tree lined paths following their owners. What a contrast to the hustle and bustle of London traffic! Be sure to visit this piece of heaven. ||July 30, 2015
748mrf||50||Amazing park which has an amazing lake with lots of services available. Lovely for a stroll and with the family.||July 30, 2015
Kurt M||30||A nice space in the middle of a bustling city. Hired bicycles and went around the paths, Central Park it ain't so bring a picnic. Nothing spectacular but was pleasant nonetheless. ||July 30, 2015
JDS404||50||A relaxing park in the centre of London.I would recommend using the paddleboats and rowing boats which are available on the Serpentine Lake. This is the best chance to explore the relaxing qualities of the park.The park is kept very clean and there are many cafés and ice-cream kiosks around this large park.Overall, Hyde Park is the highlight of my London visit.||July 30, 2015
beverlya24||50||On my recent trip to London, I passed Hyde Park on my first day and entered the park only planning for a 30 minute quick tour. But I ended up staying over two hours and then returned twice more on this trip. I loved walking among the variety of birds that populate The Serpentine (lake) and surrounding banks. They have no fear of people. And, needless to say, the varied and rich landscaping and gardens are magnificent. Further, nothing is more therapeutic and peaceful to the mind than a long walk in this tranquil and beautiful environment..||July 30, 2015
Graham W||40||Beautiful open space close to Oxford Street, Bond Street and Marble Arch. A recent addition is the memorial to the 52 people who died in the London bombings on 7/7. A simple but effective 52 pillars each show the time, date and location of the tragedies. A plaque bears the names of those who died. A simple place to reflect on the horrors of that day. ||July 30, 2015
Chinar007||50||I am associated with the Hyde park due to the Chinar trees in Kashmir and in the Hyde Park. It has also a symbol on the national flag of Canada.||July 30, 2015
Dthompsonaddo||40||I visited Hyde Park during one of the hottest days of the year. It is very easy to get to from Hyde Park Corner tube station. Even on a very busy Saturday there is plenty of space to relax, as well as lots to see and do. We stayed close to the Serpentine lake but if you want your can cycle, go for a walk and explore more of what this large Park has to offer. ||July 30, 2015
David D||40||Saturday 18th July, beautiful sunny day, we were in London to meet some some friends, who were in London from Southport and we're staying in a hotel near Marble Arch.Decided as it was such a lovely sunny day we would do some sightseeing by foot, so our journey commenced in Hyde Park by Marble Arch.The Park looked amazing, the trees in full leaf, of various colours, and the flowers in bloom, really beautiful. The were lots of people enjoying the park, some cycling, rollerblading, sitting on the grass enjoying a picnic or just sunbathing. There were many other activities going on including us just strolling along chatting away and enjoying it all. The park is huge and the pathways very wide, cycle lanes, there is comfortable space for all.Our walk took us past Speakers Corner, there was not activity there apart from people queueing for ice cream and cold drinks at the kiosk, so on we went. Before leaving the park, in to Park Lane at the Sout East corner of the park, we paid a visit to th 7/7 Memorial. This is a memorial to the 52 people that tragically lost their lives when terrorism hit the streets of London, a very dark day in this great city's history.There are 52 columns that are 3,5 metres tall, although there are not names on the pillars, there is one for each person that lost their life at the 4 sites that were attacked on that awful day. It is possible to walk amongst the pillars. There were a number of people there some stood in silence heads bowed, others spoke in whispers while others stroked the pillars. The visit was an emotional experience but was made more so as the floral tributes from the 10 year anniversary service were still on display. We slowly left the memorial and continued on our walk about the sights of London.Realise we only touched the tip of the iceberg in respect to looking at all of this great park. We will certainly be back, to explore and enjoy further. It is amazing that such a place exists in the centre of London and admission if free, so no excuse not to visit.||July 30, 2015
KAREN J||50||Beautiful oasis in the middle of London, fabulous park. Had a pleasant walk around the Serpentine. Loved it.||July 30, 2015
Jerome93200||50||A very nice place to visit when it is hot in London. Just a good green place quiet relaxing and with good walks||July 29, 2015
seafare74||50||Such a large and beautiful green space in te heart of the city. Londoners have a wonderful place for recreation.||July 29, 2015
Rebecca W||50||Hands down my favorite park! It is always a flutter of people, but there are so many paths to walk through it you never feel crowded. The Serpentine is lovely to sit by or get a boat on. The Princess Diana walk is a nice walk on a sunny day and takes you to all the best spots. ||July 29, 2015
yvr2010-06||50||The very first time I walked through Hyde Park was with my husband on our honeymoon 9 years ago. We just loved the serenity it provided considering it was just located outside the busy city centre. 9 years later we brought our sons back and they simply loved running around the big open green space. We were to make our way to the play area for children but we never made it. The boys were quite content playing and making up their own games. If you need a bit of down time in London, a great place to walk and/or visit.||July 29, 2015
LizNewCastle||50||It's a fantastic park in the middle of London. Take some down time from your trip to London to have a picnic here.||July 29, 2015
Lynne M||30||Although the Hyde park is not as big as Central Park, the best way to see the park is on a bicycle, which you hire at 2 different locations on the edge of the park. Although the first 30 minutes is free, after a £2 registration fee. It's almost impossible to see much before you have to go back and recharge your time, if you do it in 29 minutes it's free for another 30 and so on. if you're late eg. 31 minutes, it's another £2. It's a good business strategy, not sure it benefits the user.||July 29, 2015
ashghandi||50||There are a lot to explore there. a very giant Park. you can Hire bicycles there. make sure you get your code. many people miss their code since it is a two step procedure. you can have fun by renting pedal boats. drinks and foods are available inside.||July 29, 2015
314erikt||40||Nice park to walk or run, most of the park is bike free area. Good atmosphere and nice scenery. Must see when your around. ||July 29, 2015
Hotelier16||50||It is always great wonder around the Park on a warm sunny day. Then spending an hour out on the water rowing to top it off who can complain.(The rowing is a little costly)||July 29, 2015
Ann281||50||Hyde park is one of the largest parks in London. It was created by Henry VIII for hunting in 1536. The park is contiguous with Kensington Gardens.You can get there by many of the tube stations. We decided the best way to explore the parks were by one of the Boris bikes, As the park is very large 350 acres.It's the location for speakers corner, Princess Diana memorial, and many others. There is lots to do walk, cycle take a boat on the Serpentine, we enjoyed a picnic under the the shade of a tree.The park is also a popular venue for rock concerts.||July 28, 2015
Aleksandra L||50||Speakers corner,many different animals let free,greanest grass ever seen and much more to do and see in Hyde Park.In my opinion it is the best place to relax in the City.||July 28, 2015
Carolyn J||50||Whether jogging, doing yoga by the pond, sitting by the Italian garden area or strolling through on the way to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park is a welcome oasis in the middle of London. I only wish I had more time to visit the cafe and laze on a deck chair. Speakers corner is also a fun way to spend a few minutes listening to some extreme viewpoints of passionate public speakers.||July 28, 2015
JannienadKev||50||Londoners are very lucky to have such a huge space to wander around in so handy to the centre of the city. The day we walked here there was a huge sponsored walk/run for women and was nice to see all of the support.||July 28, 2015
nwillis2||40||After Westminster Abbey my husband and I headed to Hyde Park to take in the scenery and do something free! Hyde Park is absolutely gorgeous. The serpentine lake is gigantic and you can rent paddle boats and paddle out on the water. I loved the fact that the lake was full of swans and all the birds are so used to being fed that they come up close to you. Of course I got bird poop in my shoe but really that is to be expected. The Princess Diana memorial fountain is amazingly beautiful and makes you tear up because it really does capture her open heart and nature. The park is really huge, we didn't have enough time to see it all. It's very beautiful. ||July 27, 2015
rabbit h||50||Londoners are so lucky to have such a Wonderful park!! It's big. It's semi-wild, if i may say so (meaning, it's not manicured, you can walk anywhere you want, plop down, rest). No bicyclers are zooming through the park, only around - on a special path. Dogs are enjoying life leash free!!!!!!!!!!! I am so happy about this fact. Gorgeous, huge 2-3-4? -hundred year-old trees!! Linden, chestnut, oak, o-oh, Sweeeeet! ||July 27, 2015
ginspice||40||Lovely park in the middle of chaotic London. Nice place to stroll and enjoy the flowers, people watch, etc.||July 27, 2015
NP383||50||Hyde Park is London's Central Park. Everyone is there, lots to see and do. Great for people watching.Not recommended for taking a quite reflecting walk, too much going on. Plenty of other beautiful parks in the city with fewer people and more privacy.||July 27, 2015
fkokol||50||one of the greatest place in London. you must visit and you should spent enough time to feel real atmosphere. lots of things to discover. ||July 27, 2015
Hluong||40||Dont forget to bring your stuffs for a perfect pinnic. The park is pretty huge so not so crowed that you can freely enjoy your time in every corner. But it has nothing special, just for breathing, relaxing, watching and chatting with partners||July 26, 2015
rolf12014||50||A lovely mix of landscaped flower beds, fountains, rough grassland, mature trees, sculptures, monuments, and refreshments to be explored at random, follow your nose. ||July 26, 2015
GeorgiaRedheifer||50||Wonderful place to relax and enjoy lunch, listen to music or nap! The park reminded us of the squares in Savannah, Ga. Though we only had a short time, I would not have wanted to miss this.||July 26, 2015
Steve M||50||Another park around the palace area of London that is always interesting. Around the Serpentine you get all sorts of people walking and you can see Kensington Palace if you walk to the top of the park, at the other end of the park is Speakers corner, good on a Sunday to hear people rattling on about allsorts of things.||July 26, 2015
Darjoey W||30||We walked through Hyde Park by accident one day while looking for a washroom, which I must add are few and far between and sometimes there is a 50 pence fee. The park was full of people. Not much to see till we reached Kensington Palace.||July 26, 2015
Teresa V||50||nice park well maintained and well worth a visit for a relaxing sit down to watch the world pass by or wide games with others||July 26, 2015
AnnawandsMg||50||We went for a picnic on a Saturday. You can find your own bit of privacy while observing the wider happenings of the park. A very beautiful park, was also very happy I got to see a squirrel!||July 25, 2015
14maryellenm||50||We spent a somewhat rainy Sunday morning at Hyde park and candidly didn't notice the weather at all. The gardens are stunning. For those of us from the U.S., it is difficult to realize how large the park really is. Definitely worth a few hours of your time to explore. ||July 25, 2015
chloe f||40||We decided to visit Hyde Park and Kensington the same day. We loved it, these parks are really big, and it's easy to forget if you are in Hyde or Kensington. Anyway it's a to do if you're ever in London.||July 25, 2015
Cynicoren||40||Hyde park is a very nice place to spend a couple of hrs. Strolling through the park with stunning tree views,the flowerbeds, the geese, ducks and swans in the lake, and the green that looks sometimes infinite. There's Lido cafe, where you can have a coffee or a good ice cream and just view the scenery (there's a lake view). The park has fountains and other places of interest, including the fountain of joy, Achilles statue, Holocaust memorial gardens, and the Italian gardens among them.||July 25, 2015
Fiona A||40||Gorgeous park where your feet can take a battering from all the walking! Find yourself a peaceful area on a nice day and you will forget about all the chaos behind the fences.Speakers corner is quite fun & interesting,make sure you have some nuts for the squirrels as there super friendly!||July 25, 2015
Anna M||50||Perfect for relaxation after a long and tiring day exploring the city. The shade is nice and cool and perfect for sitting down and reading a book. It might also be fun to bring with you a picnic blanket and have lunch at the park. Seems clean and well manicured.||July 25, 2015
Serendipitylife||40||A little grey in winter but our boys loved chasing the squirrels and exploring the different spaces. The winter wonderland was a bit of a letdown more of a winter circus or regional show and it was sooooo muddy.||July 25, 2015
EKnive||40||Nice, clean and open park that can be enjoyed by all. By walking the park you can get to most of the Tunisia spots around central London||July 25, 2015
KarieSyd||40||A refreshing green amongst the business of London. We entered at Speakers Corner with our picnic lunch bought from Marks & Spencers. We found deck chairs which could be hired for 1.60pound per hour. A ranger collects the money. There is a pleasant walk through the centre to the lake within it which has a lovely restaurant and park area. There are nice flowers too.||July 24, 2015
ALBADEEN||50||It's the most park the visitors to London go to. It has long history and famous with its corner speaker every Sunday. Some music and sports activities are organized in the park. ||July 24, 2015
Kenzedd||50||Beautiful plants, great spacious green areas, nice wildlife. A wonderful spot for a relaxing walk. Often free events are held there or televised on large screens. Keep a eye out for these. I preferred this over Big Ben and Buckingham palace.||July 24, 2015
LanaDavies||50||Beautiful park very close to everything central. As with most of the parks in London, Hyde Park is impeccably maintained and is a great park to meet friends for sundowners.||July 24, 2015
Ekaterina T||10||It's nice to get away from the city noise, but consider spending no longer than 30 minutes in the park and don't go further in - you will be disappointed: there are no flowerbeds, not that many trees, the grass in July was practically nonexistent, there's basically nothing to see inside. ||July 24, 2015
Abir J||40||The beauty of Hyde Park becomes clear as you come near the lake. You can also enjoy seeing different types of trees. If you intend to spend the day there, I recommend that you buy your food and drink first. The food outlets on the park are difficult to locate and it is next to impossible to find seats if you are visiting on the weekends. ||July 24, 2015
Robthesparky||40||A good place to relax While in London. Good for picnics or riding a hire bike. they have Concerts in the summer and a christmas market in the winter.||July 24, 2015
943joew||40||Even if you just use it as a way to get across London, you should vist Hyde Park. Very large and very peacful, compared to the hustle and bustle of London.||July 24, 2015
Allen H||50||What a wonderful place to walk on days off, a boat row on the lake, recommended, had the pleasure of a stroll through the park after a snowfall, which made it magical. Treat yourself.||July 24, 2015
Taxidevil||50||The weather was lovely when we visited London so it was great to visit the park. We took a picnic lunch with us and enjoyed it sitting on the grass. Deck chairs were available to hire.It really is a large park with lots to explore. We enjoyed walking around the Serpentine and seeing Diana's Memorial.||July 24, 2015
WasteOfPaintt||50||Hyde Park is a lovely place to take a stroll. We visited the park for a concert one evening and loved the view! ||July 24, 2015
Roy C||50||The first time I strolled Hyde Park was in late 1962. It was beautiful then, again on visits in the 1970s and it still is today. My wife had never been there, so we strolled from the north end (speakers' corner) all the way to the south end on our way to watch the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. It was a sunny day and she enjoyed the stroll immensely. There is now a place near speakers' corner selling snacks and drinks. The park is dotted with benches. (In the past, someone would charge a couple pence for you to sit, giving you a chit indicating you had paid. I do not know if they still charge for sitting on one of the benches.) They paths are wide and shaded. Everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime.||July 23, 2015
Carsten N||50||After walking through busy streets of London, it was a delight to walk for half an hour in Hyde Park.I can highly recommend it.||July 23, 2015
Mairi S||50||You really need a lot of time if you want to see all of it, it is quite huge. We enjoyed our visit there as the weather was good and we sat at the grass gazing at the clouds. I loved the pond with the ducks and swans.||July 23, 2015
Nature_Window||50||I love Hyde Park, but it is especially magical in the Spring time. We approached it from the north (Paddington side) and walked through an area with some very old oak trees then along the Serpentine and to the restaurant next to the Serpentine. The weather was gorgeus and there is always lots of people-watching to be done. ||July 23, 2015
marieclairelove||50||Enjoyed many long walks in this diverse park. Something for everyone really. Make sure to pause at the Lido restaurant for a refreshment. There are a lot of birds that will dive after your food, so please clean up and toss garbage where it belongs. Bring cleaning wipes along to wipe down tables and chairs. ||July 22, 2015
Lussi12||50||If you go to London Hyde Park is a must: garden beautifully maintained home to various species of animals (including the adorable squirrels), all people can go to relax during their lunch break or after work. On Saturdays and Sundays the park is full of people who want to play sports of all kinds, families who make long walks or children who feed the ducks and swans in various. Adororerei if there was a park so well taken care of in my town!||July 22, 2015
ODXXC C||50||It is such a huge park in the middle of London and you can't possibly miss it! There are lovely fountains, statutes and unsuspectingly quiet spots if you manage to really walk around the whole park (and not only stick to the paths where everyone seems to be walking on). A great place to "get away" from all the crowded tourists spots you've visited all day.||July 21, 2015
MarisaS1995||30||Very beautiful place to stroll through. Can see the London Eye through the trees. Next to the queen's home, Buckingham Palace.||July 21, 2015
AlejoHouston||40||Parts of Hyde Park are absolutely gorgeous-- like the Italian Gardens and Kensington Gardens. Other parts of the park seem to have a lot of trash-- a shame that people don't pick up after themselves. Hyde Park is huge and you can spend any amount of time here that you want. We were staying close by and spent an afternoon like many Londoners seem to do-- walking around the park, watching the ducks and swans in the pond and renting a paddle boat. Overall, it is a lovely way to spend a day and if you have kids you can't beat it ! The Diana Memorial playground is also very nice, but it gets really crowded on the weekends.||July 21, 2015
JDeeside||40||Hyde park is a large expanse of green in the centre of London which links you to some of the major attractions in the city e.g. The Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace. Don't go underground and spend your time in this large open space. There are cafes and plenty of lakes and boating ponds. Lots of areas to picnic, play games and sunbathe too.||July 21, 2015
AustralianSharly||50||Loved Hyde Park. We actually went there on three occasions while in London for only nine days.We used the Serpentine Restaurant as a meeting place to catch up with friends.||July 21, 2015
ian g||40||Spent a full morning in here with my two teenage boys walking boating an ice cream more walking Hyde Park Corner etc etcThere is quality classic things to do ice cream in s deck chair an hours rowing on the serpentine loads of shady and sunny areas to sit chillax, lounge or just plain lummox around Plenty of eateries though the prices are highGet on down its a great time to be romantic or famlitic||July 20, 2015
catp79||50||I love Hyde Park! It is such a beautiful, tranquil place away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Take a picnic, hire a pedalo or rowing boat, eat ice-creams and just watch the world go by :-)||July 20, 2015
Hollie O||50||Observed a couple having their wedding photographs taken beside the lake surrounded by swans. The grounds were well looked after and the maps were simple yet effective in showing the points of interests. ||July 20, 2015
ASotonUK||50||If you want a break from hustle and bustle of London (you can get overwhelmed by all the attractions), head to Hyde Park. Especially on a sunny day it is a lovely green space where you can sit down for picnic, visit Kensington Palace café for cream tea or just go around the park and enjoy the fauna & flora (lots of ducks, geese, birds, squirrels). Peter Pan statue is a must for all lovers of the book:-)||July 20, 2015
Kaprifol||40||We used the park for running in the mornings and strolls in the afternoon. Walk around the Serpentine, check out the Italian garden, watch the squirrels, rabbits and birds, check out the Peter Pan statue and have lunch at The Lido or have a picnic. Great place for relaxation!||July 20, 2015
Vivyrom||50||It is one of the capital's eight Royal Parks.Hyde Park covers 350 acres and is home to a number of famous landmarks including the Serpentine Lake, Speakers' Corner and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain.The park also offers various recreational activities including open water swimming, boating, cycling, tennis and horse riding. It is accesible from all parts of London by subway or bus, getting off at Knightbridge station or even Paddington. A nice place to walk around or enjoy its seasonal activities. Don't try to cross it, it's a very long distance!!!||July 19, 2015
GizmosmumCumbria||50||A peaceful oasis in a busy city. Spent a lovely couple of hours people watching and drinking coffee.||July 19, 2015
446damianv||40||Always amazed at the peace and cool breeze in such a busy city. Wonderful place but beware the pigeons !!||July 19, 2015
KetanDani79||50||Yeah...I like this better than the central park in Manhattan... its beautful, clean, lovely flowers, also great to biking around.Also a perfect place for having a day picnic..Its so big too and almost in the center of London, I just wish every city in the world would have such a great park..||July 19, 2015

markwY1545ZY||50||A beautiful park near Buckinham Palace. You can rent a chair and sit and watch the world go by has a tube station that dumps out right at the park.||July 18, 2015
70alexish||50||This park is beautiful, set right near the Marble Arch train stop. You can ride around the park on bikes that are stationed around the park. You can rent one for 2 pounds a day. There are specific paths you can ride the bike and those are marked clearly. The bike path basically goes around the entire park and does not go into the main sections of the park. The famous Serpentine is in the middle of the park where you can rent rowing or paddle boats for about 12 Pounds and it is great do it with family. Right next to the Serpentine, there is the Serpentine Kitchen & Bar. The Pizza is great and made to order they have 5 kinds and of course the fish & chips and the tacos are great too! They have breakfast in the morning if you get there early.  Note: You order at the bar and make sure you tell them the table number. It's not fine dinning but to sit in the beautiful Royal Park and have a bite is a real treat. ||July 18, 2015
Craig J||50||Hype Park is a beautiful park to visit. It's clean and filled with lovely flowers. Great to walk, sit or bike ride around. ||July 18, 2015
Richard K||40||Iconic Hyde Park is a large spreading well kept public park in the centre of London with the Serpentine Lake completing its vista. Perfect for up hanging out on a family or romantic picnic. Speaker's Corner is where public speakers would expound on issues to anyone who would listen.||July 18, 2015
bobbyp18||40||London has many beautiful parks but there's only one Hyde Park. A huge blob of green on a city map, there is something for everyone: massive grass fields for kids to run around freely, play football, indulge in a spot of frisbee throwing or just chill out in one of many sun loungers or plainly crash out and let the grass hug you...and that's before you check Serpentine kitchen, say hello to a squirrel or a swan, find an inspiration in one the galleries at your disposal...||July 18, 2015
Inga B||50||After 4 days visiting the museums and all the tourist sites in London, we decided to spend a day at Hyde Park. We had a lovely afternoon watching the birds, squirrels, and people :-). Next time we will bring a picnic, some games to play and a good book to make a it a day.||July 18, 2015
Gigi_Winnie||50||When I was a teen, I would go to Hyde park in the summer and chill out or go on the pedlows. I loved hanging out here or walking round the gardens. It is such a large park right in the center of London so it is lovely to go to for a while whilst out and about in the city.I would recommend it to anyone.Around Christmas there is winter wonderland which has stalls, rides and a ice rink. It is rather expensive but so very pretty and really gets you in the Christmas spirt. In the summer it is lovely too. You can rent bikes out and cycle safely around the park. There is also horse riding and rowing boats & pedlows. I love love love Hyde Park. ||July 18, 2015
lionelw2004||50||A relaxing place to walk through and certainly will take a couple of hours due to the size of the park.||July 17, 2015
13AM81||50||The park is huge and a great place to relax and enjoy the scenery. Would have loved to spend more time there||July 17, 2015
Sherxue||40||Been to Hyde Park twice in Spring and Winter, returned to this place this Summer and absolutely loved it! Weather was perfect for us to walk around, we enjoyed our stroll amongst the birds - the beautiful Mallards, the Geese and gorgeous Swans. There's abundance of space for picnics too, so slow down and enjoy the sunshine and breeze this Summer. If you're lucky, you might even be able to spot the horses along the sandy tracks! Just be careful of their droppings while exploring the Park ;)||July 17, 2015
695dalianad||50||One of the most beautiful places i've ever been.The flowers impressed me but also the animals like squirrels or swans.Try it!||July 17, 2015
Lucy-Little200||40||Lovely park, lots of different areas and things to do/see. Loads of geese and swans, which were quite friendly. Not a huge number of benches in some areas so bring a blanket to sit on.||July 17, 2015
Bunmaster2014||50||There's a lot going on in this vast park. Plenty of physical activities. And much to see if you just like walking around. Great for people watching too. I never get bored when I come here.||July 17, 2015
NinaAlexander||50||This is perhaps one of the best things to see in London. The city itself isn't all that amazing, but the experience of being bitten on the bum by a swan is quite impressive and this is exactly what happened to my sister, after the bread she was feeding them with finished.Also, if you're going there, make sure you have a bag of nuts - London's squirrels are really friendly and brave and you might just have one come and pick the nut from your hands!||July 16, 2015
maxm2272015||40||Nice break from the city, me and my girlfriend walked around for an afternoon. Make sure you have energy to see the whole place and appreciate it and not get grumpy half way through though. If you are tired you can get food or sun tan on the grass.||July 16, 2015
C1174PTjamesb||40||I love the place.You make a day of it, head up to London, wander around the tourist spots for a bit, then head into Hyde Park as it gets a bit darker and just soak up the atmosphere.The Ice Kingdom is great fun, just strolling and sitting, eating some German food, having a drink. It's great.It is crammed though! you cannot swing your willy without knocking over 8 people.Some people say it's expensive, I say "Jog On" it's once a year, eat that £5 tiny portion of Polish potatoes are shut the F up!Really cool. Will go every year!||July 16, 2015
Sarahthexton||50||What a wonderful well maintained park in central london. the monuments in it are worth visiting and the lake is beautiful. An excellent place to spend a few hours people watching. close to the buzz of Harrods and Londons tourist attractions||July 16, 2015
AleksandarStavrev||50||One of the most amazing places I have ever been. It's nice place for couples. I recommend to get a bike!||July 16, 2015
victoriaw603||40||Brilliant concert in the park but it could have been better sign posted as Hyde park is a big park to find this in without signs.||July 15, 2015
anandklondon1||50||this is a park you want to visit if you are in London. Runs right through the heart of London. this park is a lot bigger than it looks on a map. great for a picnic in the summer. Beautiful to walk through during sunsets and even during the winter.||July 15, 2015
Sarah J||50||Hyde Park is great! You can often see squirrels at the park and on a lovely day out it is the perfect spot for a picnic!||July 15, 2015
Gerwyn J||50||We had a picnic on the most amazing May evening. The grounds are kept beautifully. The park is so huge, heaps of room for everyone. The activities, tennis, playgrounds, horse riding, and much more are impressive. We didn't have enough time to explore. Great visit.||July 15, 2015
E7066VSlisas||50||We truly enjoyed walking through this park on our way to Buckingham Palace. It was a nice shortcut. Nice and green and clean with lots of people enjoying themselves on a very pleasant day.||July 14, 2015
marceyd2015||50||Every time I make it to London, I try to get at least one long walk in Hyde park!! Its beautiful in Spring, Summer, and Autumn, a bit cold in the Winter-but still glorious to view!You can walk, run, bike or pay to ride the ponies! It boasts spectacular views a da constant paved walk way all the way to Kensington Gardens, and around the Round Pond, over to the Serpentine Gallery, to Lady Diana's Memorial and much much more! Bring a sandwich or pack a picnic and enjoy the splendor of the protected parks!||July 14, 2015

poodledoop||50||We went to the Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park on Boxing Day, late in the afternoon - lots of rides, mulled cider, wine, beer, meat pies, entertainment. My accompanying teen enjoyed it too. All in all it was a lot of fun for a drizzly dark day. The rest of Hyde Park looks like it would be nice to walk around in warmer weather. ||July 14, 2015
711filippob||50||A very nice and large park in the city center, with a nice landscape and large lake.It worth a walk to enjoy it.||July 14, 2015
Gillian B||50||Visited The Serpentine with some friends. If visiting there be sure to get precise meeting place as the Serpentine is large. Ebbed up walking all the way round to meet friends so was a good opportunity to see all that was happening. Great place for all age groups as there is something for all to do here. Spent the afternoon here relaxing in the sun at the lido cafe outdoor area. Has an area blocked off in the Serpentine for swimming. The Serpentine cafe does good bbq Angus burgers on the opposite side. Definitely recommend it as a place to chillax and get away from things while being close to transport. ||July 13, 2015
Nasib21||40||It's mostly just a standard park, it's nice if you wanna stroll the city with family and friends. During summer, the grass is very well kempt. I was there a few days ago and it looked miserable as most of the grass was dead and patchy.||July 13, 2015
Gaile1958||50||Such a beautiful park, take a picnic lunch and a blanket, enjoy the sun, feed the ducks just a nice place to visit ||July 13, 2015
kellyhmoore||50||Walked from Wellington Arch near our hotel to Kensington Palace, and back. Beautiful rose gardens, lovely lake with paddle boats for rent, people biking and walking dogs. Speaker's Corner fun to listen to people rant on multitude of issues. Started our walk on east side, and returned on west side - people sunbathing, sleeping and playing on the grass. Cyclists have a bike lane, which is necessary, so stick to walking paths, or you can easily get run down! Great day or few hours out.||July 13, 2015
365rachelf||50||You would not expect to find such a beautiful place in the capital city, it's much bigger than I ever imagined, it's beautifully landscaped and we'll kept. We throughly enjoyed strolling through here there was no hassle from other tourists or trouble from locals everybody was free to do their own thing at their own cost.We rented out a rowing boat for an hour and throughly enjoyed the sunshine and freedom. ||July 13, 2015
GeorgiaRSwift||50||There are lovely paths to walk down and large fields and benches where you can relax, as well as somebeautiful plants. Speaker's corner is also very interesting, and the lakes are lovely. A well maintained place||July 13, 2015
rudeboyjc||50||This place reminds everyone how beautiful England really is.With all the hustle and bustle in London you can step inside Hyde Park and forget it all .PLEASE DO NOT EVER CHANGE THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE||July 13, 2015
Eileen R||10||I tried to order for a child with a nut and egg allergy. After an initial language barrier with the staff member about allergies, I asked if the flat bread pizza was nut and egg free. I was told they had sold out. I asked about the children's pizza and was told it contained egg (unlikely). So, I asked what was available that was nut and egg free. He said he didn't know - I then encouraged him to ask. He went into the kitchen after 10 seconds came out and said he couldn't serve us anything. Said I should go somewhere else! I asked to speak to the manager and he tried to fob me off. I then demanded to speak to the manager who came out. I was offered a white bread ham sandwich which was nut and egg free. I ordered food for everyone else. My soup came and was told be waitress that she forgot the spoon. She then continued to serve other people - didn't seem to be able to find table numbers. In the end I went to the kitchen to get a spoon. The soup was cold on top and warm at the bottom. Terrible service. A lovely park with a family history, spoilt by people not looking after those with disabilities- it is 2015... its not on. The 5 big allergens must be catered for.||July 13, 2015
Princess_Huda||50||I enjoyed Hyde park ,very well maintained and really long and stretches long paths very enjoyable for long walks and discovering the around and abouts of the city by foot ,I recommended it to anyone visiting London ||July 12, 2015
cticarlo||50||A large park in the center of London. Beautiful and clean. A nice place to visit in a sunny day, to walk and to see.||July 12, 2015
tomhooves||40||This is where Speaker's corner is located where ordinary people can stand up on a box and tell the world going by their thoughts (within reason). But there are many other reasons I liked renting a row boat and then having tea beside the pond||July 12, 2015
kamakshi2015||50||Hyde park holds a charm as no other garden in London . This beautiful sprawling gardens holds the speakers corner at one end with Rose Garden and the leads you all the way around the towards the Kensington Garden ||July 12, 2015
Alberto170||40||Hyde Park is a must when you visit London. You can either enjoy the perfect gardens walking around or just sit down watching at the world passing by. One of the best choice for jogging/running or have fun with your dog.||July 12, 2015
TippOz||50||We stopped by with a friend to enjoy the Lady Diana memorial which my daughter loved - always enjoy this park! What a great park!||July 12, 2015
takumin2014||50||Before open British museum I went to there. Just for kill time. However no regrets beautiful and clean I spend excellent time at Hyde park.||July 12, 2015
littlejojo94||50||I came to Hyde Park with a friend on 30th June 2015, to see Taylor Swift at British Summer Time. The atmosphere was amazing, and the park was stunning, and the concert was brilliant! It was all very well organised, and it is situated in a great location, with easy access from Marble Arch station. There were plenty of food stalls (although they were pricey, but that was to be expected) and there were very long queues to use the toilets, but other than that it exceeded all my expectations and we had a really lovely day. Hope to come back another time, either for another concert, or just to sit on the grass/walk around as it is a beautiful park.||July 12, 2015
rachel f||50||I did not expect to see a park this stunning in the heart of England's capital city, not only was I overwhelmed by the size of it but more it's beauty and how well kept it is. We took a rowing boat out for an hour as we were lucky enough to catch fantastic weather and blazing hot sunshine, it was quite expensive (£24 for two people for an hour) but other than that, great way to spend an afternoon. Throughly enjoyable. ||July 12, 2015
GT-MPB||50||I really enjoy this park. It's a great escape from the traffic, a nice place to walk or run and there are lots of sights close by and in the park. Highly recommended when visiting London.||July 11, 2015
BCKC826||40||nice park in the west end , good for a stroll or to sit and watch the world go by. See a lot of horses being exercised and if you are by South Carriageway drive about 9:30-10:00am you will see the changing of the guard go by on its way to Horse Guards.||July 11, 2015
CVictorT||40||A great place to take a break from the busy city life and enjoy the green grass and trees. Good place to bike, jog, walk, or just sit on benches or on grass to relax and recover. Lots of bicycles. ||July 10, 2015
Livia H||40||I was here on the 14th of June 2015 for the annual Rath Yatra. It was a fantastic day, so many people were there, all having a great time - and we were not taking up a quarter of the space in the park. The huge size makes it perfect for the Winter Wonderland event. It would be much better with more toilets, it is really difficult to get in sometimes.||July 10, 2015
FamTimeFL||40||This park is beautiful and over whole trip we wanted to go for a run in it. However, on the way back to the hotel, we saw a violent fist fight break out. For this reason, I would recommend visiting the park during the day!||July 10, 2015
OregonMomTraveler||40||Wonderful oasis in the city. Loved strolling the grounds and seeing the Albert memorial and the Diana memorial. Well worth seeing.||July 10, 2015
Simon Y||50||During hot weather this place is booming with people. That shows you what a great park it is. It is very scenic and very accommodating to a wide variety of people. There is the lake where you can hire a boat, lots of places to have snacks, the lawns to lie about and sunbathe, the grassed areas for playing sports, the paved areas for roller skating and skate boarding, cycle tracks for cycling including London hire bikes available for rent, places for horse riding and places for festivals and large gatherings, paddling area for children (Princess Diana Memorial). There is just so much variety of space in a heavily built up expensive area of London. You can understand why it's so popular because it's a place close by for people to get out of the concrete jungle with loads of traffic and stressed out commuters. On the contrary on a cold or wet day, there is a bit less to do and people are noticably more sparse, but that's just like any park.||July 10, 2015
Laxiaozi08200912||50||Visited with good friend in Dec 2009 when they had the winter wonderland theme, this is ought to be one of the best parks that I've visited when I visited London! The giant snowman with the carrot nose, the reindeers portraits at the entrance of the park were all of some the interesting themes in the WINTER WONDERLAND)! Santa Claus is there, then we had the one and only real life MAZE! The best part is it looks invisible as if you can simply walk through but then, bang! You will get whacked by the glass wall! Therefore, you have to use both hands and move carefully before you get hit by the walls! Then in the summer, it's very peaceful and the lake is clear and clean)! In the pond many ducks and people lie down on the grass to relax. How wonderful!||July 10, 2015
kofolatte||40||It is a nice thing to rent a bike and bike around the city in general. Taking a walk, watching the birds, occasionally sunbathing, reading a book or eating a sandwich are the things to do in Hyde Park. (Except when you come during Olympics or World Triathlon Series and there is triathlon happening, which is even more amazing experience! :)) )||July 10, 2015
Jimbo732||50||This is a great place to visit especially when the weather is dry, not much cover if it's raining! Surrounded by the Bayswater Road, Marble Arch, ParkLane and Knightsbridge so very accessible. Enjoy! ||July 9, 2015
Christian L||50||I jog in this park at least twice a week, it is an excellent place to scape from the crowed streets around and breath fresh air, see the vegetation and many other ornamental sights of this park. Birds, lakes, people enjoying the sun (in summer), never to be missed in autumn, spectacular views of the ground covered by leaves. It is an Oasis in the middle of London. Regardless of whether you are a tourist or local it will worth the visit. My favourite place is Lancaster gate entrance.||July 9, 2015
David d||50||Romantic, amazing, the best moment to go is early in the morning, with the breaking down, and you see the sun rising. ||July 9, 2015
Chayma-L||50||The Hyde park is perfect for a long walk. You can walk all along, go to the serpentine gallery and then go have a drink at the bar in front of the river!||July 9, 2015
joyouswiggle||40||Big old park in central London - worth a visit if you're in the area, and worth cycling through as it's much nicer than through routes like Park Lane or Kensington High St. Recommend boating on the Serpentine for a quintessentially English feel. Bring your own food, drink, everything - cafes abound here, and flog everything at tourist prices!||July 9, 2015
Anass S||50||This park takes a lot of my time when I visit London. Its quiet and peace when there is no festivals there and amazing and wild when they do have. The Christmas festival is great there. Fun for all the family.||July 9, 2015
shewalksinrivers||50||I visited Hyde Park three times while in London. It's a great place to watch the seasons change, and there's plenty of space for picnics. Down by the water there are lots of geese and ducks and swans to watch (kids would enjoy it). There are large fields where groups can have enough room to play football or kickball, and there's a refreshment stand not far from the main gate. Lovely spot for reading or just relaxing in the sun.||July 8, 2015
garciaar||50||A park where your view is always different and you can sit and read a book or join in on a footie game.||July 8, 2015
shopwise2015||40||The system is massive and over whelming compared to Toronto or New York. The depth of the tunnels and the territory you can cover is very very large.||July 8, 2015
Bobbie435||50||I never imagined this place was so HUGE! So much beauty and activity going on at the same time. To think there have been so many influential happenings there over the years. The on and off buses are handy all along the park. I felt like it took us hours to walk through there.||July 8, 2015
MoMo87NaNa||40||I am not sure about this popular park..yes it is relaxing sitting under all the green trees while watching people pass by or watching the horse riding but there is not so many things to do, but then it is a relaxing place so we came to relax and doing nothing but chattering and watching around. The park is well maintained and just a minute from the tube station and one of the HOHO pit stop..||July 8, 2015
KJS716||50||I had planned to visit only once but I came back to this park every day on my visit. It is a green area of quiet beauty and tranquility in the middle of a very busy city. From interesting memorials (including the infamous Princess Diana memorial that is much busier and bigger than I thought) to a nice cafe and boat rentals on the Serpentine River, this is an absolutely perfect place to recharge your batteries. Plan a picnic lunch or just cool your feet in the fountain. Do not miss!||July 8, 2015
Jacopo979||40||This is literally an oasis in the city centre. If you feel like having a walk alone or with friends or just lay on the ground to relax yourself this is the place to go!||July 8, 2015
northantsnobody||50||Having been in London during the hottest week of the year, there is something special about seeing everyone relaxing in Hyde Park. You forget for a moment, that just a few hundred yards away, the city traffic is bumper to bumper.||July 8, 2015
kerrywafer||30||I have always heard so much about Hyde park, so this was one of my "must do's" for our trip. I did enjoy the open spaces, and being out of the hussle and bustle, but have definately seen better parks. I was also disappointed that Princess Dianas memorial waterfeature was not working. I loved seeing the ducks and geese, and they made for good photography on the water. We visited in summer... perhaps autumn would be more breathtaking with the colourful foliage?I will give Hyde park another chance when we visit London again.||July 8, 2015
Kashmirite||40||I have been to Hyde park many times, with family and friends.It's lovely, though it can be busy.It's full of kids playing, cyclists, people jogging, as well as lots of people relaxing.It's a great location for some relaxing times with friends or the family. Equally good for a picnic or a nice walk or even to feed the ducks!☺||July 8, 2015
Janice B||50||We walked through the park after a day in the city and hadn't realised how big this park is-it's amazing.Included is a lake where you can hire some paddle boats or there is plenty of areas to relax or play sports.||July 8, 2015
MJGx2||40||A wonderful green area in the centre of London with several memorials - the Albert memorial is impressive and the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain is an interesting design. Wandering along the Serpentine enjoying all the wildlife was a great way to spend a few hours||July 7, 2015
Rebecca M||50||There's something exciting and vibrant about London ...aleays has been. So when you crave apiece of rest and relaxation what better way than to head for one of the inner city parks. This park i imagine must be the largest and most central There is something for everyone here. Peace, tranquility, birdlife to observe and feed, squirrels and wildlife to watch and listen to. Trees in London are surprisingly healthy despite all the traffic and I guess the planes keep a better balance. There is something regal about Hyde Park,maybe it is the wonderful trees...It is home to many shows and spectacles and concerts and a great meeting place for folk. Great for people watching especially the antics some folk have with their pets. A place which seems to draw large groups of people I've noticed. There are many memorials and pockets of interest both topical and historical.It used to be famous for the speaker's corner, near to other places of interest and tourist attractions it serves as a great plainof greenery and Nature amongst the city sights of our vibrant c Capital city.||July 7, 2015
G F||50||Lots of people really enjoying this huge park in London. Use the Santander bikes to get around They are affordable and fun.||July 7, 2015
clarkUtvik||40||If you have some spare time and want to have a day in the green this is the place. Its very good with families. Bring some food, drinks, a frisbee and a ball. They find a private spot and have fun all day with your friends and family. After you can bring some food extra and feed the animals (probably not allowed - but who cares). Its good for relax and not stress if you are in the big city.||July 7, 2015
Lauines||50||After walking and walking this park is an oasis of silence and fresh air. Its scent is so sweet that it feels like heaven. I would recommend taking a whole day to walk it slowly, visit Diana Memorial, have lunch and then visiting Kengsinton.||July 7, 2015
KatieF2901||50||A great location for a little peace and quiet and a good walk in between sight seeing. There are lovely gardens to see and cafes and restaurants to fill in plenty of time||July 7, 2015
Saoirse201||50||Such a gorgeous place with plenty of walking! My favourite place was Diana's memorial! It is just beautiful with a nice vibe surrounding the area :)||July 7, 2015
WiltonL1999||50||The competition is hot for this title, Hyde Park must be amongst the very too with Central Park in NYC. A city without a great open space park is not a great city, it is just a concrete jungle and there are lots of these around....||July 7, 2015
Jacob J||40||The park was lovely. We had ice cream and strolled thru the park walking by Kensington palace. We also saw Princess Diana's play ground. It is a vey nice place to visit. We stayed just across the street at Comfort Inn Hyde Park.||July 7, 2015
ThomasAb||40||I live in the Hyde Park neighbourhood of my own community, so it was necessary for me to walk the original! The paths for pedestrians, cyclists and horses was definitely an interesting combination.||July 7, 2015
WhatCheerStephanie||50||Our hotel was across the street from Hyde Park, so we had a beautiful view. It is gorgeous and is also very busy. Bicyclists are everywhere, so watch out for them.||July 7, 2015

Carola B||50||Love to get some walk, rest as well in this great park. Get some food from the great Harrods (downstairs is located the food court) and just enjoy a great picnic! Beach chairs available !||July 6, 2015
K1w1Wanderer||50||One of the things I love about London is its parks and to have a space such as Hyde Park so central in a major city really is incredible. Early in the morning is it well used by people out exercising and in the evening in the summer lots of people are enjoying the warm evenings to have a picnic or to kick a ball. There is space for everyone. If you would rather then there are the beautiful Italian gardens and off course the elegant swans or the ever so cute squirrels !!||July 6, 2015
leanne_h69||40||Went to see an organised British Summer Time concert in Hyde Park. Great atmosphere, however most of the enjoyment was due to the weather! Ban were amazing, however not sure it would have been so fabulous if the weather had been worse. Not great organizing inside with the catering, however that was an organisation issue. Not a fan of having to pay 20p to use the loo either!||July 6, 2015
On2Legs||40||It's a huge park with all sorts of people and activities... if you want to do it justice then you need to spend a full day here.||July 6, 2015

susandelauter||50||Grab a picnic lunch at Harrods and talk a short walk to Hyde Park. Then feed the ducks and paddle boat. There is lots of bus and tube access to get you to Hyde Park. There is also food available in the park but the food at Harrods is so great and the selection is great.||July 5, 2015
Esteven||50||large park, nice for cycling and walking. I appreciated that the walk ways and cycling paths are seperated||July 5, 2015

Maxwell B||50||Great place to go on a sunny day with friends and family. We played a game of cricket and relaxed in the sun. We brought the dog too and he loved it!||July 5, 2015
SuperSpotter||50||Really nice and big park in center of London. There is lots of possibilities to do! For example, it's really nice to go to the little pond with ``padel boat``.||July 5, 2015
supermarel||40||Hype Park is perfect for a relaxed day out. You can rent a couple of chairs or just bring a picnic blanket. Can be quite busy in the summer, but I somehow always manage to find a nice place to sit down. There is a boat hire on the water in the middle of the park, which is a great activity. Would recommend hiring the boat for an hour, time tend to fly by and before you know it you have to return the boat again.||July 5, 2015
Jenny198327||50||my favorite park so far :) highly recommended! Plenty of walks. relaxing, so many things to do there!||July 5, 2015
akshay21t||50||One of the blissful places to go to in London. The suggested plan would be to do your shopping on oxford street and then relax in the Hyde Park post shopping . . We left theKids along with grand parents in the park and went shopping :) . . The park has these chairs on one side ( paid ) . . U can sit back and relax :) there is a mc donalds right across the street ( on the oxford street corner ) . . Grab a quick bite and use the common facilities if needed :) Have visited the park on each visits to London ( saw a concert there once as well ) and its always been a place where u want to go again :)relax ||July 4, 2015
DrPaulT||50||Love Hyde Park. A sanctuary of peace in London.Plenty of walks and interesting things dotted around.The stroll around the Serpentine can get busy but is still relaxing. There is even area of the lake you can swim in, and plenty of boats and pedaloes.The cafe on th lake is a favourite stop.||July 4, 2015
Katherine D||50||By far my favorite park so far. You can take a horse back tour of the park and see more than just driving by. Hightly recommended. ||July 4, 2015
Julia E||50||A brilliant place for a quiet stroll amid the hustle and bustle of the city. Stop for a coffee in one of the lakeside cafes and watch the world go by. I love it here.||July 4, 2015
Rajatm123||50||Took my 6 yr old daughter and her friend to Hyde Park around serpentine lake. An evening activity which is fun is feeding the ducks by the lake and boating in serprntine lake. Fun for kids and then ice cream, fun filled afternoon.||July 4, 2015
sarahladyjane||40||How amazing that this park is in central london! It is huge with lots of different pockets:Boating lakeCafePlay areasHorse riding tracksBike pathsSo much open green space!||July 3, 2015
MsKellye||50||The best way to experience Hyde Park is on horseback, but if you are not an equestrian a leisurely stroll is also nice. Stop and grab fish & chips for a snack, and enjoy the beauty of this historic park.||July 3, 2015
William C||40||Such a beatiful park, right in the middle of London, you could spend the better part of a day here. It is very big so riding a bike would be my suggestiong for getting the most of the day but if you have the time its also great for a nice stroll. The scenary is wondeful pretty much year round (I visit every time I am in London). An excellent change of pace in a very busy City.||July 3, 2015
ettrick22||50||We arrived during the heat wave and stayed near this beautiful parkLoved the way the huge greens in part are left unmown , the flower beds, sculptures and lakes , cafes beer gardens and trees ,and proximity to central London .this and other smaller parks were for us one of the best features of this amazing city.thanks to whoever keeps London so clean , planted and pruned and free of much of the graffiti that mars other big cities||July 3, 2015
gabipb||50||Lovely big park! I have been to Hyde Park loads of times. The bikes are amazing and Winter Wonderland.||July 3, 2015
194larryg||50||This 600 plus acre park is massive. Walking it would take hours. We used the rental bike system in the park. For two pounds a day you get on and off at the many stations in the park (If you keep each trip under 30 minutes). Ponds, paths, open green spaces perfect for exercising, walking or picnicking. Don't miss the Peter Pan statue. Great family fun.||July 2, 2015
Eleanor E||50||Even with many people mulling around, the garden was peaceful enough to be able to relax. Perfect for a run, for a picnic or just for a place to see some greenery. I like the fact there was a place to get food and drink without having to go far to find anything. Very romantic. ||July 2, 2015
stephanies648||40||Great place to walk off some jet lag :) Serpentine lake and Princess Di memorial fountain were the best parts.||July 2, 2015
Nicky C||50||This beautiful oasis of peace and quiet in the centre of a very busy part of London is a real joy to spend time in. We walked, dangled our feet in the Memorial Fountain, ate our lunch picnic style, and generally just soaked up the relaxed atmosphere. We visited on the date of Princess Diana's birthday, and there were Union Jacks fixed to the gates of Kensington Palace, which was a lovely tribute.With pedalos for hire on the Serpentine, numerous little cafes offering much needed refreshments on a baking hot day, statues, memorials ( check out the recent Bomber Command addition- it is simply awesome), and a great childrens' playground this is just a smashing place to wind down in after a busy morning of sight-seeing, and offering something for everyone. Highly recommended.||July 2, 2015
Chick L||30||Hyde Park is next to the Bucking Palace with ten minutes walk, near the Green Park side of the palace. It's a large park, but I found it not much to see. Nothing exceptional.||July 2, 2015
Clapham12345||50||Went London for my birthday weekend with my boyfriend and this is where he really wanted to visit, and glad we did, because it is beautiful. If we had more time we would have liked to have walked around more of it because it is so huge. Hoping to visit again soon!||July 2, 2015
sonalshomakash||50||Though we didn't get to spend much time here but whatever we could, enjoyed it thoroughly. I'll surely visit it again & spend the whole day here enjoying the beautiful lake, landscape, peace, calmness, activities etc. One place where you must leave your worries behind & just enjoy the natural beauty.||July 1, 2015

Jonathan W||40||Went to the BST Hyde Park concert with Taylor Swift headlining - lovely park, and great organisation to go with it. Some people have criticised it in the past but I think they have adequately dealt with most if not all of the previous problems people had.||June 30, 2015
LipstickJigger||50||Welcome to London's paradise. It's a enchanting park. You can dive in this park for all the day. Every corner of this park is bewitching. Don't forget to see the Diana fountain memorial.||June 30, 2015
GudbjorgRG||50||Hyde Park is such a beautiful park! It was so nice sitting in the park and drinking a smoothie in the sun. Next time a will definitely rent a bike and bike around the whole park. Visiting Hyde Park is definitely a must do.||June 30, 2015
mattgoodheart||50||Well if Regents Park is for the flowers, Hyde Park is for the birds...swans, monk parrots, geese, ducks and a few pidgeons...bring a lunch, some running shoes, a bicycle, a bathing suit, a blanket and as Julia Roberts said in Pretty Woman, cop a squat in the park.||June 30, 2015
Djruni||50||This is the biggest park i have had the pleasure to visit. So much to see and so much history in buldings around the park.my advice ... if you like nature... you must visit this park :)||June 30, 2015
solidlikerock||40||Very beautiful place, Probably one of the most relaxing places to just sit by a tree and read a book. I remember walking around the park, was always cold, but worth it because of the beauty.||June 30, 2015
oatesyUk||40||I can only comment on this part of this park, as i was only here to watch the who,it was all very well organised, plenty of food and drink to purchase once inside ( they didnt allow you to take any drinks in ) a great place to watch live bands, The Who were amazing on the oak stage||June 30, 2015
Jo F||50||Great setting brilliant band's fantastic location . Expensive drink great food everybody was on great form and this is the best way to see any performers better.||June 30, 2015
Fiona M||40||I love the space and diversity of this park. However our recent trip was to a concert there and the Royal Parks Company let themselves down as there was not enough toilets and drink bar facilities for the number of persons in the park. It took 30 minutes to queue for a drink which was almost the full set for one band. Surely small bars dotted around or roaming bar salesperson? To me this is 9bvious but maybe no-one has told the company in charge before now?||June 30, 2015
LoraineSM||40||Loved feeding the ducks and swans. Good cafe nearby sorry cannot remember the name but if you walk br princess Diane memorial water feature you can' t miss it.||June 30, 2015

TheRealLondonReader||50||Summer in the city and it's time to relax. Hyde Park covers a large area so take the time to explore. In the West there is Kensington Gardens with beautiful fountains and flowers, a lovely place to walk or to sit and watch the world go by. Art can be found at the Serpentine Gallery. The Western half of the park is the most natural with lots of large trees, long grass and wildlife as you move East there is more short grassed areas where during summers evening Londoners enjoy games and concerts. Hyde Park is a beautiful part of London where with little effort you can find your own space to take a breather.||June 30, 2015
Vacation561774||50||Its a very beautiful park...the gardens,flowers,tress,grasses,they look so amazing.i really love this park.you can ride a bike,you can jog,walk around because its very wide park.and under the trees are nice place to sit because of fresh air.and the bus stop are nearby only.its so convenient||June 30, 2015

vivekgokarn||50||February is cold even when bright and sunny but a walk through Hyde Park and adjoining Kensington gardens is a pleasurable experience. Lush greenery, clearly marked trails including the Diana memorial walkway, ducks, large water bodies, art and sculpture. We spent over 4 hours crisscrossing the parks and all around the circumference including the side that has a quiet row of embassies and the Kensington residence. Being a pet-friendly park makes this place extra special.||June 29, 2015

791fatimah||50||This park is HUGE!! it's great for pretty much everything; family outing, friends hangout, walking, reading and biking. Loved our day here and would visit every time I go to London in the future.||June 29, 2015
shenn09||50||something for everyone, we cycled around along the lake and visited Dianas memorial. a wonderful spot, great for kids, couples, everyone||June 29, 2015
Kara W||50||The whole grounds were fantastic, the volunteers and staff were all extremely helpful and very friendly. The services were top notch with plenty of facilities and places to eat albeit a little pricey. Straight in at the entrance with hardly any wait at all. All the stages were amazing and even with the cheaper tickets you could get really close. Amazing access to underground stations nearby and right in the middle of the city. Thoroughly enjoyed the whole 10 hours I was there. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED ||June 29, 2015
NDNSHM||50||This park is just amazing whether you are going alone, with family or with a group of friends! So much to see and do. From riding bikes to walking in the forest like paths to sitting by the amazing lake and eating ice cream. This park is always amazing and there is always something interesting happening. ||June 29, 2015
Sergio S||50|| Probably is one of the most spacious places in London, with a diversity of things to do and the perfect place to spend time with family or friends in summer festivals or during the rest of the year while practice some sports or other alternative activities.||June 29, 2015
bristol54||40||Enjoyed the music but the event was too big and there really were too many people. Too far from the stage to see the bands. Everyone leaving at 10.30 was a real H&S nightmare (50,000 plus people). Poor crowd control and there would have been a serious problem if anyone had fallen in the mass exodus. ||June 29, 2015
LGSchnor||40||When i was in London last October,my brazilian guide Ismael went with me and my Wife in a sunny sunday in this wonderful park.It was a pleasure to walk around two hours and see a lot of sightseen.As the weather was good,there were a lot of families enjoing the whole park||June 28, 2015
Thanks A||50||Okay, so the doorman said that it's sunny maybe 5 days a year, so if you're lucky enough to be there on a sunny day, it's a great place to take it all in.||June 28, 2015
TheKacko||50||I loved walking around London and getting educated about the history of London and England then being able to walk through a park and see people walking their dogs, playing Frisbee, and kids running around and enjoying the open space. It's a beautiful park in a beautiful city.||June 28, 2015
marklJ4112YN||50||Had a great weekend at BST watching Taylor Swift. We walked in and out of the park a few times, visiting the Italian Gardens, the Serpentine, the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain.We saw the wild parrots that live there too!What a great park to have in the centre of London!||June 28, 2015
AdamL168||40||Vary nice place to go in London I loved going on the boats but there was a little high but then that London for you and I hop ton go back doon||June 28, 2015
urban_fox90||30||Packed in the summer especially when there is so much going on in London. Taylor Swift was playing there when I walked through but the park is so big you can avoid the crowds. Seems like a great place to cycle as well with the Boris bikes available and designated cycle paths around the park.||June 28, 2015
Jefre N||50||Absolutely beautiful! My sister and I walked through most of the park and had a fantastic time. The gardens are lovely and well maintained. We saw a lot of wildlife. We especially enjoyed the birds at the pond. Hyde Park is much prettier than Kensington Garden. Plan to spend several hours there!||June 27, 2015
dora4444||50||After walking for a long time (and you will walk a lot in London) it's a really pleasant place to be at. Relaxing, peaceful and beautiful. If you have any spare time, give it a try, you won't regret it :) ||June 27, 2015
DoctorVonCueBall||40||Giant park where there is a music festival going on with a throng of people headlined by U.S. Star Taylor Swift. Streets blocked off and over a half million people in the area today as this is also on the main shopping street Piccadilly where Harrods and other stores are located. Nice thing it is on Tube and Bus stops so throngs of people move along fairly quickly.the Doctor||June 27, 2015
CaboRobNB||30||Nice spot to grab some shade, picnic, or enjoy some music and walking trails. It's a park so unless there is an event or concert, it's not a place where a tourist would spend much time.||June 27, 2015
cindyintexas||40||Hyde Park is a wonderful escape from the hustle and bustle of London. The Rose Garden is gorgeous and it was very relaxing to stroll through the park on a nice summer afternoon. Had a great time watching children play at the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. I would have loved to go out in the paddle boats, but at 10 pounds per person per 1/2 hour, it seemed a little pricey.||June 27, 2015
Nanna J||20||Hyde Park is ine of the least attractive parks in London, I really don't understand the hype!The grass is greyish and scorched throughout the summer and there's always some kind of cheesy funfair. If you want to stroll in a nice park, choose Green Park or St James park.||June 27, 2015
PaBirddog||50||very nice and peaceful, as well as historic. I recommend taking a few hours out of the day and stroll the grounds to get in touch with nature.||June 27, 2015
Benn91||30||We have been on many occasions to the Radio 2 Party in The Park and expected this BST to be similar. It was however not as well organised as The Radio 2 event. There were no signs from stations directing crowds to the event. Our tickets directed us to North Gate but no signs on gate to indicate which gates they were. The Radio 2 event is laid out using the parks pathways to make aisles but this event was not so a constant stream of people walking through the crowds with trays of drinks also very difficult when you are the person carrying the drinksNo food or drink allowed to be taken in. With Radio 2 event we can take a picnic.The bars and food service areas could not cope with the queues and lots of the concert we both spent queuing There were very few stewards. Plastic bottles and plastic glasses with drink in were being thrown in the crown with no one available to stop this.Toilets let not even talk about them but at the other events lots of rows of toilets available.I think our general opinion is that the organisers of this event spent as little money as possible, cutting back on stewards, toilets, signs for crowds to find their way in and out of the event. I suspect they charged food and bar providers a fortune to be on site so crowd could not take in a picnic. We are looking forward to attending Radio 2 again in September but would not recommend the BST event. Also would like to let people who have attended BST and come away disappointed this is not reflective of all events in the park.||June 27, 2015
STV_Wanderer||50||One of my favourites! I used to go during the weekends to relax and listen to music. It's also a good venue for festivals :)||June 27, 2015
Gunner196||40||I went to see the the who at bst hyde park they were amazing they were supported by paul weller the kaiser chiefs jonny marr and gaz coombes I've been to hyde park to see several live bands and i was so looking forward to seeing my favourite band (the who) paul weller was good did a mix of old and new which only die hard weller fans would know over all good a solid performance the kaisers did all there hits and they were great really got the crowd going they just rock the only down side was the barrier that separated two sections of the crowd if you had a wrist band you was aloud in when booking tickets the was no mention of this segrgation when booking tickets had we know this we would have paid the extra to get closer as there was two enormous sound stages that blocked the view for many and seemed to me they could have been moved further back The bars were very very slow with long queues when we've been before this was not a problem over all a good experience but recommend if you are going to hyde park to watch any artist make sure you get into the premium area ||June 26, 2015
chait123||40||Perfect place for a relaxing day out in London!!! There's so much to (not) do here. Clears your mind!!!||June 26, 2015
eliles||40||The park is humongous and there are festivals and other events going on in there from time to time, you can rent roller skates and take lessons, go on a paddle boat or a normal boat, chill, relax, have a picnic, whatnot.||June 26, 2015
Mihai G||50||Relaxing. I really enjoyed the long walk. The ducks and the swans by the lake are very friendly, waiting for some food. Everything is clean and...green :) There is also the posibility of renting paddle boats or bikes, if u want. I just love walking and sitting on the grass||June 26, 2015
Tarik76||50||It's an amazing beautiful park. Good for a nice walk and picnic ! you can spend the whole day just bring your own food and drinks although there a restaurant by the lake but the prices are bit high!!!||June 26, 2015
shals88||50||An evening with giant squirrels, royal swans, long walks or just hang out with friends by the lake with some good food of course, from the restaurant by the serpentine lake is my favorite thing to do on a lazy weekend and not to miss out people watch as well.||June 26, 2015
RMartinSDXB||40||One of the most relaxing places in the entire city, its a great place to escape the city and have a break. The lovely lakes full of ducks and swans its something beautiful to admire, specially, since its so well maintain. An amazing privilege to have this kind of parks in the middle of the city....||June 25, 2015
Selinawongg||40||Definitely enjoyed the walk in the park. It's obviously quite big, not sure that anyone would cover the whole thing by foot but should definitely walk towards the lake and the cafe's by the lake. I suggest renting a bike as it's easier to get around. Plenty of places to have a picnic/lay around and just sit. Paddle boats are also an option however a bit on the pricey side. You can find lots of birds,ducks,swans in the lake. Accessible and clean toilets made available too. Very chilled, a definite must see when in London.||June 25, 2015
shinysimo||50||Great place for walking/running or relaxing in London. It's very clean and quiet and more important for a woman travelling by herself, SAFE! Lots of swans and ducks peacefully enjoying the lakes:)||June 24, 2015
mariamajik||50||well organised events, loads of toilets, drinks £5 each. Both events were brilliant sound is good our last visit was to see the Rolling stones and again it was brilliant, Hyde Park is a great location to have these events. ||June 24, 2015
Jocelyne B||30||I spent a very relaxing afternoon here, enjoying the animals and the beautiful weather. It's a great walk and very accessible from many stations.||June 24, 2015
Jennifer S||50||This immense park is one of the great things about London. An oasis in the city. So many people and activities going on in all corners. Great to sit on a bench and animal/people watch or go play in the grass. Beautiful flower gardens as well.||June 24, 2015
539R||40||Loved running in Hyde Park. You can easily take a loop where you see both Kensington and Buckingham palaces. If you're lucky, the Royal Mounted Guard might go by.||June 24, 2015
JudyM214||50||We went through Hyde Park on a bike tour, but when we return to London, top on my list will be to picnic in the park, one of them anyway, and spend time their just relaxing and reading. What absolutely beautiful parks. The bridge in Hyde park over the water offers awesome photo ops. ||June 24, 2015
paschalise||40||It is a very beautifull parks.You should visit the sepertine gallery and you can also do horse riding.Also you can drink a coffee at park's cafe.||June 24, 2015

beckaj01||50||This lovely green Park where Kennington Palace is located is full of walking & bike paths leading through many green spaces, flower gardens & lake areas. While visiting this park it is also nice to see and visit Kennington Palace.||June 23, 2015
GeorgeFMarkhamON||40||A great walk, particularly in the spring and summer. Winter can be windy and wet. The Serpentine is marvellous, and there are often events on the East side.||June 23, 2015
Ladybird1000||50||Have visited London many times, and previously attended concerts in Hyde Park, but until now never stopped to really appreciate the park. A fantastic escape from the hustle and bustle, it's difficult believe Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are in the centre of our capital city and a stones throw from Picadilly, Oxford Street or the Royal Albert Hall. From the fabulous Gates by Hyde Park Corner, to Speakers Corner, the Albert Memorial, Kensington Palace, the Serpetine Gallery, cafes, formal garden areas, the Princess of Wales memorial garden, lakes, expanses of trees and grounds, these parks really have it all. Better still, it's clearly loved and used by young and old, cyclists and walkers, runners and dog owners, Londoners and visitors. Wish we'd explored this sooner!||June 23, 2015
MsAPRIL||50||I had a really good time here. Started by a walk, then rent a bicycle. To rent the bicycle, it requires a debit or credit card for a security purpose. Rental fee is £2/day. You'll receive a 5-digit code to unlock the bicycle. You can ride it within 30 mins for free. If you want to ride more than 30 mins, you can just return it to the parking and get a new code from the ticket machine. Make sure that it shows "red light" after return the bicycle back to its place. And make sure that you return it in-time (before 30 min), otherwise it'll charge from you card. The rental rate is shown on the ticket machine. Hope you guys have fun!||June 23, 2015
TMTLTBMG||40||Hyde Park is an impressively large oasis of green in such a central location. With water and colourful flowerbeds to add to the mix it gives visitors a chance to see some of the British natural flora. At the Marble Arch end you will find speaker's corner, where people come to "stand in their soap boxes" and share their views on the world. If you have time, then a visit here would add a different perspective to a trip to London. ||June 22, 2015
SunkissedSpraytans||50||Hyde park British summer time festival to see the strokes. What a beautiful place with Kensington palace and gardens at one end, Prince Albert monument , royal Albert theatre , serpentine , boating lakes, band stand etc .... All dotted around this huge park. Didn't notice any tragic noise despite being in London, the trees camouflaged the buildings nicely and it was a very relaxing place to be. The festival was done well and I enjoyed every minute & would definitely go back ||June 22, 2015
SomersetLucy||50||If you're ever visiting London, this is one of those places that need to be ticked off the list of "Places I've Visited", no matter what season you're in London - it's beautiful in autumn, when the leaves change colour; in winter, if it's cold enough, it's pretty awesome to see frozen fountains; spring flowers are beautiful in any country; and summer is perfect for a picnic, or even to visit some of the outdoor live events that are staged here. It's a great day out for anyone, to relax after the noisy bustle of the city.||June 22, 2015
tinylass||40||A huge 350 acre park in the 'posh' side of London open from 5am until midnight all year round. You can access it from all four sides including Park Lane and through Green Park. The nearest tube stops are Knightsbridge, Marble Arch, Lancaster Gate, Queensway and Hyde Park Corner. There is a large Q-Park underneath the park open all year round which is outside the congestion zone and really easy to get to from outside London. It is a massive open space with a few things to see and do but also a lovely place to sit and do nothing!||June 22, 2015
Kirsty G||50||My trip to Hyde Park was to see Blur on the 20th June 2015. To be honest, I saw little of the actual park. But it seemed clean and well kept, and very busy with gig-goers, tourists and locals enjoying the pleasant afternoon (which turned to rain, but this isn't the park's fault!)To anyone thinking of going to a Hyde Park gig, I would absolutely recommend it. I would like to say about this particular gig, that the gate staff were great, and polite (not so on previous occasions). Once in, of course the food and beverage sellers have their captive audience (once you're in, you're in and no going out!) so prices are expensive, but this is to be expected and if you reason that with yourself before you even get there you will have a much better experience. We had a really good lunch, and then a KFC when we got out to save some money! But there were all sorts of foods available, great choice. And the band were simply incredible - as always!||June 22, 2015
Komya||40||Parks can be attractions also. I got to know this when i visited the Hyde park. Its humungous. You can come with your family or even spend some time alone reading a book or listening to music. ||June 22, 2015
Dr3as||40||Had a nice morning walk in the park. Had beautiful weather and walked for an hour. No bikes is allowed on the walkpath and that is nice.||June 22, 2015
jebskulker||40||Being surrounded by residential & other buildings it's quite accessible. I've often found myself wandering around in there when I had some time to kill. The Winter Wonderland setup around December is pretty nice. Although during winter the paths can get quite icy. The Serpentine Gallery is well worth a visit if it's open, and if it's free.||June 21, 2015
happyonthebeach_11||30||It is a big park but we felt like it wasn't as well kept up or as clean as it could have been. There were a lot of people so I am sure it is well used. There also seemed to be a lot of dogs running around unleased- a big no-no.||June 21, 2015
philippam2006||50||This is one of the nicest of the Royal Parks. It is vast, very peaceful and beautiful. You often see the Blues & Royals exercising their horses here, which is always a sight to see. The Serpentine is also lovely, with its river, wildlife and pleasant cafe. ||June 21, 2015
Lotus439||40||Hyde Park is very good for a stroll in the evening or just to relax in during a busy day. Bring food and drinks as there is not many places to buy anything in the park.||June 21, 2015
nicholasl678||20||What is so nice about a gloomy park with bare trees in winter? If I were to jog, then it is useful. As a tourist, there are more interesting places to go. ||June 21, 2015
Tanvir I||50||In London this is the best place I enjoyed.the wide ground with full of green and the lake. The place where you can spend some romantic time with your partner. ||June 20, 2015
aspd3815900||50||They had a big concert going on with massive amounts of people inside an enclosed area. We walked the perimeter from the Queen's Gate to the Marble arch. It would take 3 or more hours to see the entire park, all it's features and statues. ||June 20, 2015
Melodybungle||50||We visited when the sun was shining and it was very relaxing to wander around. We sat on the grass and people watched. We ate an ice cream. We had a leisurely paddle around on the boats. Beautiful park. We saw a heron on the lake as well. It is so large so I am sure we missed bits out so would love to visit again. ||June 20, 2015
NoFranchisesAllowed||50||My daughter runs the park each morning. She says it is always very active. I visiting on a beautiful 75 F/23 C day, sunny with few clouds. It was a Saturday and there were a lot of people in the park, walking, running, walking dogs, having picnics. I enjoyed the vibe I got walking through as it was very nice to see so many people enjoying the park. There are many trails/roads to walk through fields, around tree lines, and along the Serpentine river. Don't forget to find the Peter Pan Statue in Kensington Gardens on the other side of the Serpentine, my 4 year grandson loved seeing the pictures of it as he has seen it featured in a movie. ||June 20, 2015

DebbieH530||50||This park reminded us so much of Central Park. It's so beautiful and a nice escape from the city. Grab a baguette and enjoy some down time having a picnic at this park. There are so many huge trees to sit under and relax. One of our favorite places in London. Be sure to bring money for the bathrooms.||June 19, 2015
Aurora A||50||I love to run, and this place is perfect for it, is huge and all green with lots of trees, there is a lake also. The best place to run in London, definitely!||June 19, 2015

426ChrisD||40||Huge park. Bring your walking shoes and maybe even a lunch. This park is giant. There's multiple parts to it. You can play ball, walk through gardens, feed birds, take out paddle boats, get wet in a princess Di little water park area, fun for the kids. ||June 18, 2015
AliceW33||40||Great for a stroll. You can imagine that you're not in a city at all if you want a break from the hustle and bustle.||June 18, 2015
dgg123||50||We still through here every time we come to London. Love the speakers corner even if you do not agree with what is being said still fun. Stroll among the trees and head to the Pond to rent a peddle boat for a hour or so. then just relax and enjoy the surroundings.||June 17, 2015
Norma4298||50||Huge green area. A lovely place for walk or to relax. Beautifully maintained. Can hire deck chairs. The Diana memorial feature quite serene. ||June 17, 2015

Racingtiger||10||I fully agree with Rachel1984's review. When I arrived this morning the manager was outside emptying the bins, I asked if they were open and received a terse 'yes'. Shortly afterwards he came inside and started to make my coffee without washing his hands (!) and when I pointed out that the lid on my cup was very loose I was told with a shrug, "they're all the same." My colleague and I have been here on a number of occasions and I should point out that I know there are pleasant staff who work here however this sullen and unfriendly manager is, clearly, not in the right job.||June 16, 2015
Ricardo M||50||Everything is very clean, organized, the birds are just marvellous. A great walk, sightseeing. Close there you can see the gard change and the royal palace.||June 15, 2015

kendstar||50||I had the pleasure of strolling along Hyde Park on a Tuesday evening. I was told that Hyde Park should be visited only on the weekend by my friends but I am so glad I didn't listen to them.The park is huge and so beautiful.We started in the rose garden which contains many beautiful flowers with roaming bees. We continued towards the lake and saw all the ducks and swans.We visited the memorial for Princess Diana and then we finished by walking towards the Albert Memorial.We haven't seen half of what this park has to offer. I am sure there are a lot more beautiful gems to discover.Do yourself a favor and visit this park. You will not regret it||June 14, 2015
SweeeY||50||Great place for a stroll. There are swans and duck on the lake. Perfect for a picnic as well. The rose garden is filled with many roses and worth the visit!||June 14, 2015
Ynhockey||30||Maybe it's because I visited in 2014, after they reduced the size of the Speakers' Corner, but the Hyde Park was just a big letdown. There are a few nice statues here, but overall it's just an undermaintained public football (soccer) field. Absolutely nothing in the park was interesting for me.I tried to come at the peak time of the Speakers' Corner, hoping to see this interesting London phenomenon, but alas, it was empty as well.||June 14, 2015
Seelyme||50||Beautiful place to go when the weather is nice. Pack a picnic and settle in for an hour or two. It's fun to watch the birds and do some people watching. Cute little water park to cool off. We rented bikes and rode around the park. ||June 14, 2015
natalieytan||50||Arguably one of the more famous parks in the world, we did not appreciate how large it was until we visited and probably did not set aside enough time for it.This beautiful park boasts many interesting features and is obviously well loved by the locals as well.The features we had time to have a look at were the rose garden as well as the princess diana memorial fountain - which looks like a lot of fun to take your kids to!||June 12, 2015
lottimac||40||Great place to catch your breath. Or even to go for a run or cycle. Beautifully kept. Clean. Peaceful. And the roses and looking stunning. Lovely monuments from the huge Alfred mem to Peter Pan( if you can find him!!)||June 12, 2015
LilJessie94||50||One of the many parks in London's city centre. Hyde Park is a great place to sit and watch the world go by, or take a stroll through. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.||June 11, 2015
mgoblue82||50||Took a stroll from our apartment which was a 5 minute walk from the NE corner of Hyde Park. It is very peaceful and tranquil. We could let our toddler run around without having to worry about him getting lost or bothering anyone. There is a huge pond in front of Kensington Palace that is very nice and has a lot different types of avian varieties to view and feed. I would highly recommend Hyde Park if you have some free time that you'd like to kill or a day that you just need to relax. There are cafe's around the perimeter so I'd encourage you to pick up a sandwich or two, grab a bottle of wine and relax in the middle of this urban retreat.||June 11, 2015
Jacqueline W||50||Absolutely love this park. Visited on a Sunday when it's bustling with families enjoying the sunshine as well as weekdays when it's much quieter and equally the visits are so calming.||June 11, 2015
Manzarra||40||If you have the time go to Hyde Park near the Serpentine and rent a chair, sit by the water or rent a boat and enjoy the fun.||June 11, 2015
mike e||50||Hyde Park is and always will be our favorite park in London. The walks are enjoyable, the verdure is well planned and it is beautiful in most places. The new "loos" at the Italian Gardens area have been there for a year or so now, but now it will cost 20 p. to pee. Oh well, they are clean. There is some good statuary here and there, and though it is quite large, the park can be enjoyably traversed from the Bayswater side to the S. Kensington side in about 20 minutes or so. We always have time for the park at some point and it suits well for picnic lunches. Even the multitudinous joggers have become a lesser inconvenience when we sit here to relax and enjoy strangers' dogs at play.||June 11, 2015
eve7125||50||Absolutely love Hyde Park. So many different things to find. Lots to see and do or just relax. Rose garden is lovely and so is the Italian gardens. Good for bird watching too!||June 11, 2015

Shaun C||50||This is my second visit in 2 months. Once again the staff are unbelievable. Courteous, professional, attention to detail (Kiran) and nothing is too much trouble. ||June 10, 2015
lindacschoeps||50||A lovely and beautiful park in the middle of London. Very nice to just walk around in after a long day on the crowded streets. To be able to just get away from everything and lie in the grass is a very relaxing thing to do on a sunny day!||June 9, 2015
DamaneekM||50||Its a must visit if u have some time to spare! Away from the hustle bustle! We had coffee and snacks from this little shop near the princess of wales memorial walk!||June 9, 2015
Rachael C||50||My fiancé and I stayed at the Lancaster Gate hotel bordering Hyde park and Kensington gardens. I recommend going there, it's so beautiful and charming and has monuments around the park. ||June 9, 2015
Michelle W||50||We were blessed to stay right on the edge of Hyde Park while in London. I had NO IDEA that there was such beautiful open green space RIGHT in the Center of London. We took our morning walk there everyday on our trip and saw all kinds of interesting things- such as colorful wild birds eating out of peoples hands! Incredible giant statues, sparkling ponds with unusual brightly hued ducks. We probably would have skipped Hyde Park if we hadn't have stayed so close- DON:T MISS IT!! Bring a sack lunch and a blanket to sit on while you watch the local teens play a pickup game of soccer... or is it futbol?||June 9, 2015
Tange2200||50||tranquil and fresh in the middle of London- room for play, contemplation, walks - wiht dogs, kids, tourists and locals all mixed. I love that place more than Central Park||June 9, 2015
Kilo T||50||Combined with neighbouring Kensington Gardens, this is the largest open space in central London. In fact it’s not always easy to know where Hyde Park ends and Kensington Gardens begins. But both parks are highly popular and always seem to be busy with both visitors and locals alike enjoying what’s on offer. The main feature of Hyde Park has to be the Serpentine lake with its lido, which strangely changes its name to The Long Water once it goes under the bridge. Other features include the very popular Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. Other features include the Sackler Gallery, and Holocaust Memorial Gardens, and on Sundays Speakers Corner can provide excellent entertainment. There are also places to grab a bite, or go for a more substantial meal. During our visit we were fortunate enough to see a troop of Horse Guards from the nearby barracks exercising their horses on Rotten Row.||June 9, 2015
weeezoo||40||Lots to do and see. People use the park for cycling and running but its a lovely place to relax after doing a whole day of shopping.||June 7, 2015
JosephZee||50||A great royal park. Lots to see & with 350 acres to. It you are never going to see it all.My favourite was the Speaker. corner where my friend & I had a wee go at airing our views to the surprise of the other visitors.Obviously a lot of Londoners it either to relax or to get from one place to another.The Princess Diana fountain was nice to see as was the Serpintine.The flowers are amazing and we came across a little cottage which had all the old flowers still growing around it. Think it was a former gardeners cottage, beautiful. Visit this park when I am in London.||June 7, 2015
drjavedrasheed||40||I have always enjoyed visiting this park in leisure.The atmosphere,the green lawns,the benches,the ponds,the swans,the shady trees... Have an overwhelming effect on you especially if you are a nature lover and one is reminded of William Wordsworth's quote about his poems : "Emotions recollected in tranquility ".As a lover of art,I also make it a point to watch all those artists sitting on the pavement outside the park who sell their works and paintings and did pick up some with my wife and they dawn our living room.Dr.Javed Rasheed||June 7, 2015
cfern1463||50||what a place to picnic walk run cycle anything you can imagine you can also rent a horse and go horseback riding through the park on designated trails we were also there for the London triathelon with all the athletes it was quite a spectacle. a good day out and have a picnic while the children play at one of the playgrounds. it is nice any time of year as they are constantly updating the plantings.

NatalieNickol||50||It's a big and green park, good for picnic and walks, you can get a bit lost there. There is a cute refreshment point at the beginning of the park. If you walk along the alley near Park Lane, you will reach Speaker's corner and Marble Arch. Serpentine lake is nice, with lots of birds in it.||June 6, 2015

LLMorel||50||Beautiful park right outside of London within walking distance from the best hotel Inn at The Park where you will be pampered like a king. Expensive but worth it and all within walking distance from what we can call downtown London. Cheers!!!!!||June 5, 2015
Penthesilya||50||Just take your time and enjoy it. Walk, have a picnic, take a boat... Take many photos of it... Don't forget to bring along snacks for squirrels, they not just expect it, they demand it :) Very cute.||June 5, 2015

PHDSydney_Australia||50||A beautiful park that lets you enjoy the quieter moments in London. A place to relax and so well maintained as only the British can do||June 4, 2015
Michael M||50||Hyde Park is a great place to stroll around and just relax. The setting is serene with all the geese and joggers. It is literally picture-perfect.||June 4, 2015
Yashoda N||50||A historical place. A place to break and to enjoy the waffles! Green space & natural connections to take you away from the busy life of London!||June 4, 2015
valeryah||50||Hyde park is one of the largest parks in London, as well as one of the Royal parks too. The artificial Serpentine lake marks the boundary between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.Famous for its Speakers' Corner (located in the northeast corner near Marble Arch), were people can make free speeches on Sundays.Tube stops: Knightsbridge, Hyde Park Corner, Marble Arch, Lancaster gate.||June 4, 2015
TH Y||50||A great park for relaxing in the big city. I love the rose garden and the lake side. My husband and I enjoyed having a morning walk each morning. So refreshing!||June 4, 2015
480christyc||50||I'm not a fan of city life so anytime there's a green space I will be there. My first trip to London was in the early 1990's and Pavorati was giving a free concert in Hyde park. It practically shut the city down for the afternoon but people were out in the fresh air to hear the music. It is a fantastic memory.||June 4, 2015
Afifah6320||50||The first time I visited Hyde park was with a tour group in 2012. Did not get to see much of anything . About two weeks ago I went to London UK again with a friend. We stayed in a hotel opposite to Hyde park. So on our last day in London we were determined to see what makes Hyde park famous. We definitely fell in love with the beautiful park. It's big and spacious with beautifully cared for gardens. There were lots of wild flowers. In the middle of the park there's a beautiful lake with swans and a variety of birds. There were friendly squirrels up on the trees that actually followed us begging for nuts I guess. Will definitely visit again and this time will bring a picnic basket too!||June 4, 2015
hor_heManila||50||This park is no Mr Hyde! Luscious green. Lake in the middle that is so calming. You can have a sun boat ride too. The Italian garden is relaxing. My daughter likes the Princess Diana memorial fountain, great place and fun to soak your tired feet on the flowing fountain. Bird lovers will like the different feathered friends you hear chirping around. Statues are "talking" but you need an active Internet connection to avail of this feature. After dinner stroll or morning jog are best activities in this park. ||June 3, 2015
lsav-17||50||Stayed across the road from Hyde park. Beautiful gardens and a lovely walk through. Kept very tidy and clean. Italian fountains beautiful and princess Diana's memorial is even more so. A lovely tritute to our late princess. We were there on a lovely sunny day so my daughter was able to enjoy the princess Diana's fountain along with all the other children splashing around.||June 3, 2015
3awasha||50||the best park in London.we can easy forget about time and spend the whole time here walking feeding ducks, playing in the slides have a meal in the cafes/resturant and rent a boat.it is soo huge||June 3, 2015
Armando_74a||50||This park is located in the historical part of London being surrounded by many monuments and well known areas. This park is one of those itself... People from London loves to come here and enjoy the park (specially if sun shows,,,). ||June 3, 2015
Kate B||50||Sit and ponder, walk and talk, enjoy the peace or absorb the hustle and bustle. Just love this place. ||June 3, 2015
BRLArgentina||50||The park is huge and beautiful. To me, the best of it is speakers corner on Sundays after 4. You´ll find all kind of people arguing about the most weird subjects. Get in by Marble Arch||June 3, 2015
MobinaZK||50||I love green spaces, no matter how big or small. Love the park for it's lake and the calmness during non-touristy hours. Can get a bit crowded during the summer. Lovely spot to sit and read a book or feed the birds.. jogging and walking are both good options too :)||June 2, 2015
CKEllis||50||Very calm and lots to see. The fountain for Princess Diana was breath taking, the wild life was abundant and interesting. Loved my walk there.||June 2, 2015
N2249IIwilliamt||50||Went here with my girlfriend had a really nice walk around the park saw some amazing things. Was to cold to go boating or a swim but definitely coming back in the summer to do both. Really cool to look at the trees and stone work and see people that have carved their names into them and put dates. I saw a Bill that was there in 1850 which was pretty cool.||June 2, 2015
vaztaba||50||It is a huge common park in London, worth to visit. Have statues, animals, cafés, perfect place to relax, enjox the nature after a long day.||June 2, 2015
Nitika A||50||Its nature at its best in middle of London. You can roam around for hours. The change of guard ceremony is one thing not to be missed.||June 1, 2015
anugoel||40||It's a huge park and really beautiful. It has a cafe in the center of the park right beside the lake and very neat and clean. It has a great ambience. The cafe has amazing hot chocolate. Great place.||June 1, 2015
gammish||50||We walked the park after a visit to William & Kate's house - Kensington Palace. Great break from the city and, like many parks in the city, an escape from the hustle. ||June 1, 2015
mad4scrapping||50||Gorgeous park with monuments to Albert and Diana, among others. Great for walking and people watching-- an oasis in this big bustling city. Beware, however, if you want to sit on a lawn chair, you have to pay! And you have to pay to pee-- it made me want to drop my drawers behind a tree, as I do on the AT. But I behaved myself. We visited the park twice during the week we stayed in London.||June 1, 2015
Belinda C||50||Hyde pRk is a beautiful place to escape the london craziness. The park has multiple facets and can offer a nice time out from the hectic capital life||May 30, 2015
Kapil K||50||It is a big park with a long lake inside it. Go to this place in summers and soak up the sunshine. you can walk around the park, there is be people cycling, jogging or skating. You can also try boating at the lake but boats are a bit expensive - 12 pounds per person||May 30, 2015
Halldor t||40||Great to take a walk in good weather and sit down and we went to princess diana memorial fountain and that place in wonderful.||May 30, 2015
Nicki S||50||Because we had a particularly sunny day, we decided to stop through Hyde Park, and we weren't the only ones! Yet despite the large sum of people roaming through the huge garden, it wasn't at all cramped. Lots of statues, fountains, flowers, and monuments to see throughout if you're looking for a leisurely stroll, and there's also the Serpentine Bar & Kitchen if you get hungry!||May 30, 2015
GlobetrottingSwede||40||It seems to be the largest park in London and features an enormous lake and wide open space. People come here for sports, gatherings and relaxation. Many restaurants and hotels located within walking distance to the park.||May 30, 2015

Claire M||50||We walked through this park on our way to the V and A museum and we were very impressed how beautiful and tranquil it was. It is a haven from all the hustle and bustle of the city. A very attractive space to enjoy.||May 29, 2015
Pamela Jane L||50||First time around Hyde Park and what a lovely Park to walk around the sun was shinning which made a big difference there was plenty to see a lovely big lake plenty of swans a boating lake a statue of Peter Pan loads of very tame birds that came up to you squirrels it was all such a beautiful park||May 29, 2015
B R||40||Famous in the world Hyde Park offers you a variety of places to see and lots of space to stroll through. You will need a map of attractions to see as park is really big and offers a lot. Make sure you find the cute legendary Peter Pan statue - definitely a must see! If you visit during weekend make sure you go also to Speakers Corner to see the free speakers - interesting experience really... If you visit during winter there will be Christmas market (but check the dates on internet first).||May 29, 2015
roy768||40||Fantastic gardens for a leisurely stroll, surprisingly it was not jammed with people, but enough to enjoy the worldwide pleasure of people watching.||May 29, 2015
TinySeasideDancer||40||This is the huge park where Henry VIII hunted. You can't believe it is right in the middle of London. It is beautiful and made for a most enjoyable walk. ||May 28, 2015
Sally A||40||It's a beautiful place to take a leisurely stroll with coffee shops offering meals and drinks. Nothing to dislike.||May 28, 2015
David S||50||Hyde park and Kennsigton park are connected making a huge park that begins at Kennsington Palace and extends eastward encompassing miles of biking and paved walking/jogging routes to travel. On the northwest corner you will find Princes Diana's gift to children a great children's park where you'll find a lots of excitement for younger kids age eight and down to spend hours. The Italian Gardens begin in the north near the middle and begins a water area that includes the Serpentine. Here you can rent paddle boats and lunch along the river. An entire day can be spent in this park enjoying the outdoors while seeing many sights offered and maintained perfectly. Bike rentals are at various spots along the park that will help you see even more than on foot, but it will still be hard to see it all!||May 27, 2015
KYULAUDI||50||Love Hyde park! Very spacious and comfortable park with lots of different species of birds. The squirrels there are very friendly and won't leave you alone. You can ride bicycles there and just have a lazy picnic or nap!||May 27, 2015
meanderingRN||40||Went here to meet a friend for some lunch before leaving London.I think we walked around about a quarter of the place- IT IS HUGE. Did not expect this in the middle of London.Now I'm sure to locals the squirrels are just annoying but to the unaccustomed eye they are rather cute and adorable and they are everywhere in the park!!One word of warning the deck chairs as it turns out aren't free only reason this isn't an excellent park.||May 27, 2015
ken b||50||beautiful park near the palace and you can sometime see the house hold Calvary riding through there during the day, some nice places to stop and have a coffee while walking ||May 26, 2015
pacemaker1||50||Hyde Park is a vast relaxed area in central London. Great for walking , cycling, getting away from the crowds and if you are in the mood a boat ride on the Serpentine. Small waterfalls, vast green areas and more bird life than you could ask for. Cafes for a seat and rehydration. Benches to relax and watch life go by and lots of shaded areas along side the sunshine pathways so if you are starting to heat / burn up you can find some protection. Walk past the Diana memorial and head up to Speakers Corner or on to Kensington Palace. Just be careful of taking pictures at Kensington Palace as the building is stunning but if you leave the park at this entrance there is no photography allowed. ( Isreal embassy etc )||May 26, 2015
Nomade_On_Earth||40||In this park you will simply forget you are one of the most busiest metropolis of the world. The park is very well maintained. There is plenty of space for everybody. You can go running, walking, ... or simply lay down relaxing after a difficult day at work.Several statues (e.g. Peter Pan) and spots (e.g. Diana's fountain, Italian garden) can make you visit more interesting.||May 26, 2015
countessraven||40||Ive been to Hyde Park quite a few times (many) so think its about time i reviewed it ! Well what can one say about such a grand old park in London ? Well its an absolute treasure and everyone who visits london needs to visit here too. I spent a long lazy sunday afternoon here with a bottle of wine and a picnic just relaxing in the true sense of the word. And whats more i had one of th tastiest ice creamts here a delectable peaches and cream flavour from the food pavillion. I want to try the boating lake next time i visit . I would like to see more toilets as for such a huge park there isnt adequate toilet facilities. Whenever im in london i always try to visit hyde park and of course its especially brilliant december as its home of the winter wonderland||May 26, 2015
Elliern||40||We enjoyed our walk around Hyde Park. But it is quite large and rather noisy. The gardens are lovely and the Princess Diana Fountain is very unique and beautiful. There are places to eat, row boats and paddle boats to rent, and public restrooms. We saw people riding horses during our walk. I think the gardens are nice in this park and the fountains are beautiful, but I prefer the quieter St James Park that is nearby.||May 25, 2015
Joanne W||50||We spent an afternoon in Hyde park when stopping off on our way to reading. It's awesome! So many things to see and do. The Diana Princess of Wales Memorial fountain was lovely and my 6 year old loved paddling in there for ages. It was so nice to see so many people enjoying themselves and so peaceful, we walked around for ages, fed the squirrels, watched the roller skaters, sat and enjoyed an ice cream by the lake and went on a nature trail. Great afternoon hard to believe this is in the middle of a big city.||May 25, 2015
IRBtrip||50||This is a great park to visit while in London. It helps take away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city with vast park lands filled with flowers, trees, ponds and sculptures. There are a good amount of cafes scattered throughout to keep you fed and watered as well.At the weekend you will find the park teaming with picnics but there is enough space that you don't feel too crammed it.We would recommend visiting on a nice sunny weekend with a picnic and just enjoy the park, feed the ducks/swans and enjoy a slice of countryside in the big city.||May 25, 2015
DrNahed||50||It is am amazing place, must be visited, free and extraordinary beautiful.there are flowers, trees, area to have food or drinks, pond , roller blade place, every thing a family or anyone would like to enjoy in a sunny day||May 24, 2015
Dayana T||50||Some fresh air, cute animals and a huge green space - not someting usual for a city centre. I was there with my brother and we made a lot of nice photos and loved watching the geese and the squirrels.||May 24, 2015
scottishtraveller74||40||Been here a couple times once was for a triathlon. lots of areas to walk in and as others have said its hard to believe your in central London. a couple cafes etc if your feeling hungry or thirsty.||May 23, 2015
Vanessa E||50||A wonderful park, lovely river and plenty of space to relax and enjoy the sunshine (if there is any). Plenty of activities for young and old.||May 23, 2015
TimPlus||50||I love Hyde Park and each time I am in London the park motivates me to take out my running shoes and get a couple of KMs done ! Once in Hyde Park all busy London fades away. Such beautiful and quiet place ! For me a must to visit each time !||May 23, 2015
Martz560||40||Nice place to take a walk, enjoy the sun and feed the swans. It can get really crowdy on sunny day! Great place for a morning jog, too.||May 22, 2015
Muhammad K||40||Long lazy day in London at Hyde park. away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, the sun was bright like the glow of a candle so we took a wee walk through the park & gardens. plenty of things to do wildlife in the park too and lots of seats to sit and take in a view and in the summer they say you can hire a deckchair and soak up the sun and if like my mrs then turn into a lobster. ate at the restaurant, fantastic fun stuff for kids, they were happy as larry and enjoyed boating on the river and river rides. Nice 2 see flowers blossoming, picknics laid on the grass and everyone with big SMILES. A bin to winter wonderland in winter and had a fab time plenty to do rides and lots of laughter.||May 22, 2015
familytravels71||50||I went with my 9 yr old so we could rent bikes and tour around the park. Unfortunately you have to be 14 to rent the bike. We tried anyways but the bike is too heavy for kids. It's also busy on the path. It was fun to watch the people feeding the birds and them swooping all over. You can rent a peddle boat but we were short on time and it was 14£ for 30 min. I love seeing the horses around as well.||May 21, 2015
Judith H||50||No matter what time you can be sure to have a wonderful time in Hyde Park. Just take a long walk and enjoy the relaxing atmosphere...||May 19, 2015
Silvia P||50||Summer time in London means to be out and about every chance you have. And Londoners do just that. They can be seen with their families, friends, dogs, or by themselves reading a book, at this park. Be sure you do the same. ||May 19, 2015
520wilmaw||50||This is one of London's many cozy parks. Bring some food and a blanket and then just sit down an enjoy life. But make sure that it will not rain - that might not be so pleasant. ||May 19, 2015
Toni T||50||London has so much to offer but should you require peace and quiet you could do no better than HYDE PARK. This massive park has so much to offer for all from boating on the Serpentine Lake to hot meals, and you will not be lacking things to see from the Diana Memorial Fountain to the Albert memorial. You might even like to ride your horse on the famous rotten row or just relax from the madness of London||May 19, 2015
Essexnat||40||A lovely place to spend a few hours. The serpentine has herons flying around, business people sit on park benches to read books on their lunch breaks, youths play football with each other, runners with their headphones on sprint past, dog walkers smile as they pass by, tourists with their maps seek directions, families walk their children, and no sounds of the London traffic, just the planes passing above on the discent to Heathrow. ||May 19, 2015
L920DZbillb||50||stopped here for lunch and a drink. got my food and proceeded to sit outside along the lake in nice comfortable chairs. great view of the lake and the birds....as well as people watching.||May 19, 2015
Miriam R||50||Take a leisurely stroll through this beautiful park to see the wonderful plants and flowers set in formal beds along the many pathways of this huge space. People watch as the more energetic go about there fitness routines jogging around and through the park. This is a lovely space to sit and have a picnic, ride a bike or paddle on lake. Plenty of places serving refreshments too. Sunday in the park is a favourite||May 19, 2015
652adelek||40||Recently went to hyde park for a jog. It was beautiful. The place was nice and many people were jogging too! Especially loved ending my jog at a cafe within the park called the serpentine. Wonderful place to just enjoy nature and take back all the calories you just lost from jogging!||May 19, 2015
TottoV||50||We walked around in the part several hours this sunday. Weather was grey but no rain. The park is just beautiful at this time, the first spring flowers just opening to the sun. Especially the area around the Serpentine is great. ||May 19, 2015
sulby||50||We stayed at the Lancaster Hotel during a trip to London to see a concert at Royal Albert Hall. The hotel overlooks the park. What a lovely park, so impressed with it, walked across it 4 times. So peaceful and beautiful, saw, squirrels, rabbits, swans, geese, heron and numerous other birds. It was like being in the country. If its a nice day, you could spend all day there. Loads of people there but didn't feel crowded. ||May 19, 2015
rachel984||10||I had such a stressful experience in this resturant I would like to advise that others avoid it. One member of staff was seen shouting at members of the public in the vicinity and telling them to get out the way. He turned out to be of all people, the manager! He also caused a scene when the person serving me accidentally gave me the wrong drink. Instead of allowing her to correct it for me easily he stated an exchange could not be made which was of course ridiculous and so I opposed it. I got the correct drink however the man refused to apologise to me. Such insolence set an awkward end to what would have been a nice relaxing final drink of the day. Avoid at all cost - the drink wasn't even that nice.||May 18, 2015
598giadas||50||I would have never expected to find so much greens and trees in the center of the city (zone 1)!There is a bycicle, pedestrian and horses path all park long.There's also a very big lake with ducks and swans for lovers who want to live a romantic afternoon.||May 18, 2015
Mitch M||50||We love the atmosphere in the park. Great things to see, love watching the horses trotting down the path, the Princess Di fountain is my wife's fave. Lots of area to explore, a great walk in nature. Never seems crowded, but lots of people unwinding during the day.||May 18, 2015
dpjess||40||Lovely park within central London to take a break from the bustle of the capital. It may not be the Royal Gardens but is still well maintained and clean. ||May 18, 2015
yokef79||50||Excellent for family, kids and couples! Many things to do in the park. Plenty of people enjoying the spring weather. As we went there as couples, we were thinking of our kids back home that we could have brought them one day to visit London and to play in Hyde Park!||May 18, 2015
JKJABB||50||When the weather is nice in London, make sure you head to Hyde Park for a soft-serve icecream from an icecream truck, and a lazy sit on a deckchair (which you can hire). Walk down to the lake where you can sit outside at Serpentines Cafe, hire a paddle boat or read a book by the water!||May 18, 2015
smiths669||50||Proms in the park provides a wonderful evening of entertainment culminating in a rousing patriotic celebration running alongside events at the Royal Albert Hall for a fraction of the cost||May 17, 2015
pinked_10_11||50||We loved our walk in the park with so much more to see. Foliage was spectacular. Lots of people enjoying the park. The dog park portion was awesome to see but made us homesick for our fur - babies at home. We will explore further on our visit.||May 16, 2015
debsmillen66||40||Remains a great park for many things, including Kensington Palace, Diana's Memorial Park and fame spotting. After spending all day in central London it was great to walk through the park and see people relaxing and enjoying themselves.||May 16, 2015
MATT_SWK||40||The park is huge and has some great gardens and locations to just sit, lie down and relax. Beautiful scenery and is a great place to be in the sun after a busy hectic day.||May 15, 2015
donnak930||50||Full of historical statues, the pond is iconic and a great place for pictures. We saw the Peter Pan statue, walked through the lobby of Kensington Palace. Enjoyed the flowers and beautiful lawns. Peaceful, lovely, easy to navigate, right adjacent to shopping at Harrods. Worth and add on walk if you've been shopping.||May 14, 2015
737littlem||40||Hyde park is vast and open. It's the perfect place to ride one the rental bikes dotted around town, or walk the dog. Horse riding is also permitted as there are sand areas designated for horses. It's a quiet park with plenty of places to sit and get lost in the surrounding beauty, or to walk around during summer whilst eating an ice cream. There was a café on the side I entered the park and several activities such as bowls and tennis in the courts.||May 14, 2015
xraymike85||40||Great open space in London and there is always something to do, no trip to London is complete without wondering through hereFor pictures please check nimzzzy on Instagram||May 14, 2015
FaddySue||40||A visit to Hyde Park in spring is always wonderful. We stayed at Thistle Kensington Gardens opposite Hyde Park. The park is beautiful in spring where flowers were in full bloom and the trees were all green with leaves. Spring is the perfect time to enjoy Hyde Park where the weather is not too hot and you can enjoy a stroll or a jog without breaking a sweat. A picnic by the lake is also a pleasant experience. ||May 13, 2015
19Rainbow87||50||I went last summer with my friends. We took a little boat and we spent one hour in the serpentine. Nice experience!||May 13, 2015
kateharmond||50||I'd forgotten how vast this park is, with the Serpentine Lake a massive attraction in its centre. The Lido cafe is a great place to chill by the water, with all its exotic birds and glorious trees all round. Diana memorial a huge disappointment- very plain and tacky. This is a great time of year to see the flowers and blossoms at their best. Even the robins are tame and will eat from your hand!||May 12, 2015
MihaiSir||40||Hyde Park is a place you wanna relax and walk. The view around is amazing considering that is in central London. I would recommend it for a Sunday walk with friends or family. If you are a jogging fan then this is for you as well. Keep in mind that every winter there is Winter Wanderland coming.||May 12, 2015
noorain||50||Acres of green space with spectacular trees.A must visiting place for nature lovers.Italian garden with beautiful , vibrant flowers and fountain was particularly attractive.Nothing to dislike||May 12, 2015
Emmab B||50||I think Hyde park is the biggest of the Royal parks. It truly is never ending. It is brilliant in the summer for a wonder or a picnic but be warned it can get very busy in parts.There are various things you can do in the Hyde park such as visiting speakers corner. feeding the Ducks and Swans, take a boat ride on the Serpentine lake, visit the Princess Diana memorial, there are also a few cafes/ bars that you can stop at. It is hard to get board and you could spend a week there. Hyde park is also home to some fab events such as summertime London concert and Winter Wonderland. Hyde park is easy to get to on the tube but once in the park it can be hard to believe you are in London.||May 12, 2015
Dunks961||40||Even though the summer is probably best for the parks, the winter still gives you great photos and views, and the environment is lovely and quiet in the morning too.||May 12, 2015
Andreia R||40||This park is huge! You have to be prepared to walk for a very long time if you want to visit it. But believe me when I say that it is worth it. Pack some snacks and just go explore it, because that's the fun part really. For example I discovered the flower walk by coincidence and it is amazing! On the contrary, sadly the Princess Diana memorial is nothing special. In the park you have bathrooms but you have to pay in order to use them.||May 11, 2015
Ghadeer2014||50||Hyde Park London Hyde park in London holds a very special place in my heart. The park is a very distinctive part of London. Walking or jogging there is very relaxing especially if the weather is cool and sunny. People are always happy and enjoying their time at the park. I always have a very refreshing walk through the park. It is a must visit for tourists and visitors to London. See photos.||May 11, 2015
Julie P||40||It is a very nice park and it was nice to escape to city noise for a little while. I walked from Buckingham Palace to the Natural History Museum.||May 11, 2015

beth j||30||It was the happiest time of the year.Just a day before Christmas when we went to Hyde Park to experience Winter Wonderland.There will be a kid in me forever so Adam brought me here because he is sure I will be delighted.Rates for entrance is not bad if you really planned of going but if not and no kids with you I suggest to skip Winter Wonderland.||May 10, 2015
Julie B||50||Hyde Park has a lot to offer Londoners and tourist a like one of the Royal Parks to visit. The park is taken care of by a number of Staff, volunteers, patrons and sponsors who all do a great job in taking care of it. With miles different walks to choose from all levels of fitness can be achieve. their are a number of activities to decide from such as roller blading, roller skating, bike riding, swimming, roller skiing, Boot camp, paddle, walking the dog, or taking time out to distress this park has it all. There are a number of themed areas including Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, Kensington Palace, Speakers Corner, Serpentine Gallery and many more attractions for a free day or to treat yourself to afternoon tea a enjoyable and relaxing day out. ||May 10, 2015
Sandy K||50||We stayed Park Lane Marriott which is located directly across the street from this massive 350 acre park. Inside the park there's the Serpentine lake for boating and swimming, a horse stable, several full service restaurants and its super dog friendly.The landscaping is incredibly beautiful and there's several Princess Diana memorials. I was surprised that they even had a modern museum of art called the Serpentine Galleries which we checked out. Really enjoyed the different species of birds and water fountains. I'm so happy we experienced this park and its amazingly located right in the heart of the city. You can get here from the tube and many buses stop here - so it's very accessible||May 9, 2015
WadeanaMD||40||I never realized how HUGE the park is! Every time my partner and I took a walk through, we found a new little hidden garden or feature that made our day. The grounds are immaculate despite the amount of traffic and it is kept as free of rubbish as could be expected (the odd bit occasionally seen). The paths are well marked and maintained and it was super easy to make our way to various parts of London by walking through the park. So great!||May 8, 2015
LeeMTucson_Arizona||50||Sometimes you just need to see a graceful swan couple necking. Or a flight of swans majestically lifting off and circling overhead. Well, this is the place. A wonderful park with broad spaces and dogs on the loose (typically very friendly dogs I might add), is a great page to enjoy the day.||May 8, 2015
Marianna W||50||Wonderful park. Very spacious. Nice walk along lake. Careful, they lock the underpass walkways in the evening. Also the side of the park nearest Kensington Palace appears to get locked in the evenings as well.||May 7, 2015
Beth1322||50||Wonderful park. Wish we could have stayed longer and could have rented bikes to check it out more. Really enjoyed the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain.||May 7, 2015
Rachel W||50||A lively green space in London so big you have so much to see and do it makes for a really nice day out and is lovely in the evenings||May 6, 2015
V7885MSchristopherd||50||Whether by bicycle or just walking there's something for everyone. It's a great example of how much beautiful green space there is in London. It is best in the summer where you can hang out or engage in some busier activities including horse riding. And you can then go on to green park and Buckingham Palace if you have the time.||May 5, 2015
David M||50||There are a number of former "royal parks" but I think this is the best, edging onto the front (well, actually, it was technically designed as the rear!) of Buckingham Palace, with Whitehall (Downing Street and Westminster) at the other end. Nice for lying on the sun, cycling or just walking past the lake and admiring the swans and ducks. Plenty of food available locally, either within the park or in nearby streets, so easy to get some food and out together a picnic.||May 4, 2015
Sofia G||50||The title pretty much sums it up. Visit at least the part with one of the two ponds (I visited the round pond) for some pictures near sunset. ||May 4, 2015
Michael-James_Lee||50||This is one the amazing parks in London, a great expanse of green which I love to go for a run or a leisurely cycle trip!||May 3, 2015
djhallett||40||We had a wonderful stroll around this magnificent park which is so very popular on the weekends and the weather is fine.Plenty of birds to see.....hire a boat and go for a paddle or just soak up the sunshine like most of the visitors||May 3, 2015
Abid S||50||The Best Park in the Center of the City, Spent one whole evening here, as I was in London in summer. I haven't seen the NY parks, but till then this is best park I have been to till now in the big city in the Center of the City. Very Nice!||May 1, 2015
Ed R||40||This really is an enormous park and the area around the Diana Memorial Fountain / Isis statue / Serpentine is very attractive. However I found some of the signposts not very clear - it sent you off in one direction then at the next junction there was no mention of what it was I was looking for. As a result I missed Peter Pan. Lots of green spaces with some afternoon sunbathers. Perhaps some of the space could be used to put in some things for children? Anyway, a nice walk but needs a bit more in my opinion.||April 30, 2015
D_Jekyll||50||Hyde Park is smacked in the heart of London was easily accessible on foot from our hotel in South Kensington. It is a lovely park, well kept & clean, suitable for a nice evening stroll. There are also bicycles for rental similar to those around central London. Highly recommended for families & couples.||April 30, 2015
Ingrid M||50||love the fact of a big park inside a big city.A breath of fresh air, well treated, safe, great for big walkings.They do big events such as The Winter Wonderland on Christmas time that is such a marvellous event. Alone, as a family or as a couple is definitely a stop in London.||April 30, 2015
Alana K||40||Myself and a few friends meandered through the park on an early spring afternoon. We enjoyed the variety of ducks and geese, as well as sitting by and watching the kids play in the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. It would be a great park to run in, or a good destination for a picnic on a sunny afternoon. There is also a cafe with outdoor seating if one should so desire.||April 29, 2015
se50820||50||Hyde park is a very nice oas. Spend time here just relaxing and enjoy. There are several places to visit. If not - go for a long walk or run. Many activities to watch. Information is available making it easy to plan your hours in Hyde park.||April 28, 2015
YYC454||40||It has got just about everything - even better if it's a sunny day when you go. Worth visiting as it's got long tree-lined walks. There's the Serpentine lake or pond, with small boats for hire. Some people skating, cycling even some horse riding. Tennis, sports, flowers, cafes, exhibitions, toilets and a great place to picnic. It is so huge, so that you should pick an easy meeting place for friends and family. We always like to walk through the park, paralleling Kensington Palace, just resting on the grass or a wooden bench. It's so relaxing.||April 27, 2015
AlanM924||50||Very large park with large lake. It was a sunny day when we visited, so we walked for miles. Boats on the lake, horse riding etc. Toilets and places to eat. Great for a picnic. It is so large that you can easily find a quiet spot to sit or sunbathe. We always like parks, and this is one of the best. You can also walk on into Kensington Gardens if you wish. Recommended||April 26, 2015
Dalry||50||Leaving the snow of a New Brunswick winter behind, it was such a delight to spend a spring afternoon in Hyde Park. This place is always busy, but amazingly there are quiet corners and plenty of benches where you can find a peaceful haven in the city. Diana's memorial is always busy, but head past that towards Bayswater if you want to avoid the crowds.||April 26, 2015
mkaeberlein||40||This is an impressively large park in London. Lots of trails for walking and jogging with large open spaces. A horse trail runs around part of the park, which is interesting. We saw a group of riders from a local riding school. Worth a visit, but nothing particularly spectacular or unexpected here.||April 25, 2015
Elizabeth T||50||A lovely park in the middle of London where you can cycle, jog, stroll around, ride horses, row boats in the lake, and more. I went there during the spring (April 2015) when all the flowers and trees were blooming - a gorgeous sight. I highly recommend you devote at least 2-3 hours to this great park.||April 25, 2015
Jay289||50||No better place to sit and chill with your friends and spend your day at open air :) we enjoyed to the maximum :)||April 25, 2015
roshni r||50||This park is a great place to be with family, friends, partner. If you want quiet, you can walk into the hyde park, which is huge, and get lost or sit under a tree and enjoy the piece. If you want loud, you can go to speakers corner or sit where there are many people, especially by the water. The best time to go is when it is sunny.||April 25, 2015
glamourprincess||40||I love city parks, and Hyde Park is an icon within parks. This huge city park is a well-needed green lung in central London. The park is quite big and features palaces, lakes, boat-hire, wildlife, art and monuments. I do think St.James park is prettier and Hyde Park does have a few open areas with nothing to see or do which makes it a bit vast land. But hey it´s free, so enjoy!||April 25, 2015
akstone1031||40||Loved this park for walking. Bikers had to stay on designated lanes. But we stopped to sit in chairs by pond and after 10 min were told it cost 1.60 pounds per hour to sit...so we kept walking. ||April 25, 2015
Rampikino||50||No better place to jog - long routes with variety, plenty of paths and a huge number of historic views along the way. Just keep running and soak up the sights.||April 24, 2015
r00m_with_a_view||40||Hyde Park is a huge park with one great advantage -which ever way you walk you can be in the hustle and bustle of London or you can wander the park and take in this "green lung" .To the north you have Bayswater Road and then Marble Arch ,Speakers Corner.To the east you have Park Lane then into Mayfair or down to Hyde Park Corner and Piccadilly.To the south you have Knightsbridge, shops, shops and museums (V&A) (Science) (Natural History)To the west you have Kensington Palace and Kensington Gardens and Kensington High street (more shops)You can walk to the Albert Memorial and the Royal Albert Hall -and by now you will be worn out !! Inside the park is the Serpentine ,cafes, deckchairs ,the Serpentine Gallery, the Princess Diana Memorial -it's just a great place to be.Relax and enjoy !!!!||April 23, 2015
Travelistar||50||My favorite park in London! Had a nice walk amongst the lush greeneries. Nice huge park with so many spots to chill out at. Please do a picnic if you can. And don't forget to bring bread to fit them big swans. Its fun when they come up to you and grab the bread from your hand. :) Me and my friends had fun boating in the serpentine. It costs £12 for 1 hour or £10 for 30 minutes per adult. They have family packages too. Its all indicated at the counter. y suggestion is to do the 1 hour (at least) and bring drinks and snacks on board.. You won't regret! I loved it and definitely recommend having a ride. It could be a romantic activity for those on dates too!||April 23, 2015
hzcurri||50||We walked through Hyde Park on our way to Kensington Place. Everything is well maintained and despite it being early spring we enjoyed the budding trees and daffodils.||April 22, 2015

Jossa92||50||Really nice park, a little lake. Nothing more to say really. Perfect way to spend a sunny day. Toilets and ice creams are to be found at every corner.||April 22, 2015
Pratibha C||40||Had a great walk across the lush green garden.Every well located and many attractions are near the park. Cycling and other activities can be done .||April 21, 2015
CaroleScott||40||We enjoyed walking through here, although my two children (8 & 9) got a little tired as we went in at the corner to Green Park & wanted to get to the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain!The children loved seeing the HUGE swans, even though it was quite a winding walk!We stopped at the Lido for a drink, which I found quite expensive...which is the norm in London to be fair.I think this is a great park to bring children to as there's some lovely play areas, ideal for a picnic & generally to run around & have some fun.Carole : )||April 21, 2015
agave22||30||Hyde park should be the glorious centerpiece of London. Instead it is a very large park that is poorly designed. There are vast sections of nothingness that are mind numbing. It seems almost as if the city forgot to provide a plan for each section. There are some nice features scattered (widely) around. I especially liked the newish Diana fountain which is interactive, and the Serpentine art galleries. The huge lawns provide ample space to just sit on some grass. And the Italian Garden is pretty, but not sure what is Italian about it given its naturalistic setting, other than the water fountains. Basically Hyde Park is a 'large green space' that you jog through on the way to somewhere else. Perfect for large outdoor concerts and rallies. It could be so much more, ||April 20, 2015
WMIM||40||With the adjacent Kensington Gardens this provides a huge, attractive green escape from the busy city.My visits are few and far between nowadays but when here I like to sit on one of the plentiful benches on the northern side of the Serpentine. This lake, and its continuation into Kensington Gardens, is not natural but was created from the waters of a now-underground river. When the river became heavily polluted it was diverted away and the lake is now of water taken from deep underground.The area to the south of the lake was the site of the Crystal Palace. This centrepiece of the 1851 Great Exhibition was moved to south London afterwards but sadly lost in a fire nearly a hundred years ago.The eastern boundary is Park Lane with Mayfair beyond. In this part you will find two memorials, to 'Animals In War' (reviewed separately) and to 7/7 victims, of which I'm not allowed to expand on.There is plenty more of interest here including the Marble Arch and Speakers Corner (both reviewed separately) in the north east corner, and a number of interesting statues plus the Queen Elizabeth Gate (reviewed separately) in the south east part, near Apsley House (reviewed separately).The vast 'Winter Wonderland' with fairground attractions, a circus, ferris wheel, seasonal food and produce covers much of the south east in the run up to Christmas and beyond.||April 20, 2015
TDFtraveller||50||The park is exactly what a city should have.Nice foodie placesDucks,geese, pigeons, deck chair hire...The list is endlessHire a paddle boat or Rowing boat.Or simply go with a picnic and sit on the grass!!||April 19, 2015
Konstantinos K||50||A very beautiful and clean park where you can spend your free time. I used to run very often in Hyde Park when I was living in London. You can also relax close to the lake enjoying your coffee. I really missed this park!||April 19, 2015
Mehdi R||50||A good green spot in the centre of London with lots of attractions around it. It is free and a respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. Good day out with family in summer. Good for walking or jogging. You can cycle in some parts. It says where you cannot cycle.There are few cafes around but you can get you picnic. There are benches to sit around. Bear in mind some of the folding and deck chairs are placed by private operators and they charge a certain fee for using those.||April 19, 2015
amyg0928||50||Hyde Park is beautiful and huge! There is much to see there and could spend hours walking or biking the trails seeing the sights. A great place to go for a jog or long walk. We stumbled upon it from our bus tour and spent a few hours walking around. You can also walk to the Duke of Wellington Statue and Buckingham Palace from here!||April 18, 2015
Annie-G1968||50||Any day in London is busy...take a break from all the hustle and bustle and pushing and shoving....and take a leisurely walk through the park & gardens.Plenty wee places to enjoy a takeaway coffee or ice cream.....or head for the Serpantine and find a restaurant and fun stuff for the kids to do. there is boating on the river...river rides...plenty wildlife in the park too.....lots of seat to sit and take in a view...and in the height of the summer...you can rent a deckchair for a time and soak up the sun!....failing the deckchair...lie on the grass under shady tree......lay back and enjoy!||April 18, 2015
Chant13||50||I love Hyde Park. it is like stepping into a magical world where the hectic London traffic doe not get you anymore. What i recently found that is even more amazing, is that the Royal Parks Foundation, has events happening in the park almost everyday. For kids and adults alike: from discovering insects and trees so yoga and wellness classes! Pretty awesome! Their program is on their site http://www.supporttheroyalparks.org/shop/experiences and it is very comprehensive! Love it! The park has great spots for alone time, romantic walks and picnics, running around with your puppy and for family days out!||April 18, 2015
Egamd98||40||I personally enjoy tremendously going for a run wherever I travel. My last trip to London was no exception. Hyde Park is as lovely a run as it gets with Kensington Palace, the serpentine, and the Royal Albert Hall just to mention a few landmarks within or around the park. ||April 17, 2015
Ruth C||50||Whether you live in London or are just visiting, Hyde Park/Holland Park/Kensington Gardens is the place to get away from it all. A wonderful area with something for everyone. Lakes, play areas, amazing buildings and galleries, somewhere to people watch, ... the list is endless. What's more it's free (apart from boating, food, etc.). Sunday morning is an open forum at Speaker's corner (Marble Arch end). Great to watch people get up on their soap boxes to air their views and rant to the general public. ||April 17, 2015
Trusstytraveller||50||Wow, so large and so quiet in the centre of a bustling city. This is a great time out area to recharge yourself if a tourist (and if a local) and take some real quiet downtime from exploring. The park is beautifully maintained. I was disappointed we did not see anyone at speakers corner, but the stroll and walk through the park was awesome.||April 17, 2015
Sushil262||40||When I first visited Hyde park I couldn't believe my eyes, that a park can be so huge. To see so much of greenery in the heart of the city was a unique and a pleasant experience.It is a perfect place for a picnic, especially with children and/or friends. There is a lake where you can do boating too. The park is very well maintained. Must visit place.||April 17, 2015
Jimlalaland||50||This big park (about 350 acres) offers a big green space to try to forget, that you are in such a history-rich city. There is a nice man-made lake where you can go swimming or boating. Nice, fresh afternoon in the “nature”.||April 16, 2015
alwayspositiveJJ||50||Huge, diverse, popular, people watching, boating, jogging, bike riding, swimming, Walking, Promanade - You can do the lot, no visit to London is complete without spending 2-4 hours here. ||April 16, 2015

lyana||50||Lovely place to hang out Especialy for kids, feeding the swan and fish Spring is the best time where the park ia most beautiful||April 15, 2015
Momotei||50||Popular park in London central with cafes, gardens, lake etc for a stroll or cycling. Located at Hyde park station and near to Harrods mall, it's is usually crowded with locals and tourists. Very nice park to hangout with friends.||April 15, 2015
ShaneMcDonald||50||It's hard to believe the size of Hyde Park. When you get in you get absence of how vast the place is. The first time I heard of Hyde Park was in reference to the Queen concert held here in 1976 which drew a crowd of 150,000 and you can see that the Park is large enough to accommodate that crowd and much more. The park is so well maintained and the flowers and trees were either in bloom or budding for their summer floral show. It's only when we came to the lake that the real vastness was on show. Also check out the Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain which is certainly worth seeing. One mistake we made was having tea at the Lodge on the entrance to Hyde Park - paper cups, eating pastries out of the bag and service which was a tad surly .... We should have waited until reaching the centre of the park where 2 very decent looking restaurants/cafés are located. It is well worth visiting and I will come back to explore further. ||April 14, 2015
RealSweDrummer||50||I would say that Hyde Park is a must if visiting London. The park is big, clean and a very relaxing place to spend a couple of hours on a nice day. Highly recommended!||April 14, 2015
ilGrec0||50||Everybody has heard of Hyde Park and it is really a must if you visit London, especially for the first time. However, whatever you expect, you will be trully amazed by the magnitude of the park. It is unreal. It is just like a forest within easy grasp from the very center of London. Spend many hours there, go for jogging, etc, but do not miss it!!||April 14, 2015
myrabelle||40||Great park to see local sports group, runners, cycling is also available. It is a great place to stop and relax on the way to whatever other amazing place you are on your way to visit!||April 12, 2015
sipivu||50||I used to live very near the North side and work on Piccadilly. I was crossing by foot twice a day for 1 year and I have seen it on every season.It is a great park: you find a lot of trees, a little garden on the East South side, a large pond where you can rent canoes, a restaurant next to the pond, statues on the North side, Buckingham not too far, Kensington Garden on the other side, etc. You can see horses and their riders, joggers, etc.. There are a lot of things to do, and many people to look at.It is a great park.||April 12, 2015
KatherineKay||50||My friend and I walked through here (from Lancaster Gate) to Buckingham Palace. We enjoyed the view and scenery London has to offer so the more-than-1-hour walk was a fun one! Lots of statues here too!||April 11, 2015
Eric-Jan||40||After spending a number of days visiting museums and shopping it was very relaxing to walk through this beautiful and quiet park and sit on the grass. The park is enormous and has paths for pedestrians only and pedestrians+cyclists. Dogs are allowed without a leash (well, I assume so). Children can run around and play games. A lot of people are jogging.Recommended.||April 11, 2015
Juliabudgen82||50||A true must for any visitor at any time of the year. It is so big and busy there is so much to see and do even in the park let alone the rest of London. Fun to meet people, go for walks, attend fairs eat, drink, play, have meetings. Don't miss it is a real little world in its own right.||April 11, 2015
FrazerBell||50||We stopped here on our to see Buckingham Palace and also on our way to Westminster.The park is beautiful and the wildlife is great to see, lots of space to just sit and chill with a picnic. We had our own food and just as well because the vendors prices were terrible.I have read a few reviews of people complaining about not being able to cycle, this would defiantly cause accidents ads the place is very busy.||April 11, 2015
Goldenwall||40||After roaming around the entire day, exploring the city, Hyde Park is a good spot to relax and enjoy a little peaceful time. The views are amazing and the whole atmosphere of the place in itself is perfect to help you enjoy and wind down. It also has lots of free spaces around and fortunately is also less crowded. With a perfect weather, this green space is what you need in the heart of the city.||April 11, 2015
anti_christl||40||Best place to go for a run or jog in the City. Plus you get to see, how the city slickers walk their dogs.||April 10, 2015
Barbara C||30||Walked all the way to Hyde Park Corner planning to rent bikes and cycle round the park - had been looking forward to this all week and the weather was perfect. The first two terminals weren't working. By the time we got to the next all the bikes were gone. Without the wind in your face and being able to cruise along, Hyde Park is disappointing and pedestrian (excuse the pun!). The park itself looked to be in poor condition, made it to the lake for a sitdown and a commune with the swans, way the best part. Definitely a disappointment for anyone who knows the Phoenix Park in Dublin - or even Stephen's Green for that matter!||April 10, 2015
TasminMarie||40||I came here yesterday for a picnic with my partner, there's loads of space to sit and relax. You can rent deck chairs but we opted to bringing our own blanket and sitting on the grass. There are lots of trees to sit in the shade or loads of open grass to lay out in the sun. We had a nice little walk, watch out for all the cyclists as there are lots but there are some paths that are cyclist free so they're not a major issue and you can borrow bikes yourself if you'd like a little ride around the park. We only got to explore a little of it as its so we'll definitely be returning to have a better look around. We didn't try any of the food places due to bringing our own food but there was a little hut selling food, an ice cream van and a coffee place I believe. We fed the swans in the lake and tried to feed the squirrels but they weren't interested in the food we had. Both sets of animals were very tame and seemed used to being around humans as they all came right up to our hands to check out the food. I watched a woman feeding this one squirrel and he just kept running back to her for more and would take the food straight out of her hand. I'd definitely recommend this place for families or people just looking for a nice spot to relax and talk.Tip: make sure you bring 50p/1 euro in case you need the toilet!||April 10, 2015
Charlotte T||50||Absolutely stunning park. It is huge so plenty of places to walk with a big lake in the middle. Definitely recommend coming here on a sunny day. Lots of wildlife to see such as swans, herons, ducks and squirrels. Safe to bring your children too as cycling is only allowed in restricted areas and dogs are supposed to kept on a leash (although there was one crazy dog not kept on his leash scaring all the birds- I was very unimpressed with the owner the sign blatantly says please keep your dogs on a leash and this owner let his dog run through the water, almost knocking small children over!).Excellent facilities with multiples restaurants and eateries scattered throughout the park. Lots of information boards with facts to read. Toilets cost 20p so I recommend bringing change if you have small children or a weak bladder! Shame it costs money but the toilets were in great condition and very clean with a member of staff on duty.||April 10, 2015
Providenza||50||It was a pleasant walk in the cold winter morning by the Princess of Wales memorial fountain.It was my third visit of London and Hyde Park and would love to go back in spring time.||April 10, 2015
Jenny S||50||I walked in the park about 2-3 hours and it was wonderful. I sat at the Serpentine and it was a very nice view. I like to sit in a park and to know you are in a big city like london. There very not many tourist which was also good.||April 9, 2015
Robert F||50||All the London parks are lovely and this place is very special. To the south Knightsbridge, the museums, Harrods, The Royal Albert Hall, Albert Memorial, to the east Princess Diana`s old house, to the West Park Lane, Mayfair, Buckingham Palace and to the North Bayswater and Paddington Cheap nice hotels and the central line tube stations and in the North West corner at Marble Arch you have the huge Odeon cinema and nice MacDonald's and the start of Oxford Street Watch your change at the café on the west end of the serpentine, they tried to rip us off by adding £5.00 to a lemonade and a coffee.Take a picnic and a flask||April 9, 2015
lbarlow2_99||50||We took time to walk in Hyde Park. From the Grand Entrance to Speaker Corner. I was a nice time. I got thinking about the history around me and It was a way to get out of the Hustle and Noise of the city but still be in it. ||April 9, 2015
kdy3r||40||Enjoyed 2 hours of relaxing in the sun with a couple of beers. As always when the sun makes an appearance you can expect the park to be full of people however there are still plenty of spaces free to sit and watch the world go by.||April 9, 2015

20anastasijat||50||It is lovely place, park is huge, but in the warm summer days there still can be many people. Last time we took small boat for one hour, it cost us around 12 pounds for a person. A bit overpriced, but still it is quite popular. It worth to go there! Although i have doubts that you can avoid this place :)||April 6, 2015
kalezz90||50||Huge park to relax and enjoy. The weather and the nature is fantastic, and of course the view of the river is more than nice.Of course I will visit this place again if I visit London in the future.||April 6, 2015
GoolieBrent||40||Great walk at side of serpentine. Saw parakeets wild first time. Smashing walk. lots of wildlife about. Dissapointing to see a large dead Perch in the lake on bottom. This is a very nice area in city to walk||April 5, 2015
YN_Trip||50||My favourite place to walk and relax in London. The place where you can walk alone and enjoy the nature, and at the same time good place to walk and have fun with friends. Squirrels, ducks, swans and other birds are inhabitants of this park.||April 5, 2015
fernando_rees||30||It's probably one of the biggest parks around London and with the fewest trees and shades. Just a flat field of grass extending to the horizon. Nice to go for a run or jog, easy to keep away from tourists keeping in the way like zombies. But not the most beautiful park out there.||April 4, 2015
Alina P||40||Oasis in the big city. This is what it is for me. I love it when it is green during the summer time and i love it during winter, when it hosts winter wonderland. Eat, relax , run, ride or meet here.||April 3, 2015
places2seeplaces2go||50||When staying in London I usually stay in hotels near Hyde Patk. There is nothing I like more than after breakfast, to take a short stroll or long walk around Hyde Park. There is just so much to see & it is so peaceful. You can almost forget that you are in one of the greatest cities in the world when walking around the park.||April 2, 2015
Sean J||40||What a great relaxing park to go for a walk & escape the busy city & get up close with the little furry wild life||April 1, 2015
SVALE2014||50||The place is amazing, beautiful and relaxing, but, you walking a lot and I recommend 2 or more days to visit all park. It´s Worth visit! I went in August/2005.||April 1, 2015
Lauren R||40||Winter wonderland was taking place when I visited London and it was very expensive, 8-10 pound per ride and food was quite expensive too but I guess you can expect that in london||March 31, 2015
Karthik R||40||A great park to relax in the evenings. Try visiting on the weekdays when the crowd is relatively less.||March 29, 2015
BostonChik85||50||This was a highlight walking through this park. There was a lovely cafe where we say and drank tea and people watched. It's refuge from the hustle and bustle of the city. Great spot for pictures too. Walking through the park showed signs of early spring with flowers starting to bloom. ||March 27, 2015
Tony S||40||For being such famous, I found that the park needed a good clean up in some places. Alot of workers driving around but there was alot of rubbish especially behind the fences. good place to have a walk and relax from the shops and busy London||March 25, 2015
CheersSacramento||50||This park has it all. It's a MASSIVE size and beautiful. You can people watch to your heart's delight, roller skate, jog, picnic, view Princess Diana's memorial fountain, stroll over to Kensington Palace, feed the ducks, the birds or just enjoy the sun on one of the benches. London is full of lovely parks and this one fits the bill for everyone. If you didn't pack a lunch there are food vendors all around the park with good prices so you can buy whatever suits your mood and then cross the street to the park. We highly recommend this park and the surrounding area.||March 25, 2015
crc1||50||Another gift from our Royal Family (well snatched from them) making London a designated 'forest' because of the large green footprint of its gardens and squares.This was formerly a royal hunting preserve opened to the public in the early 17th century. In 1851 it was the location of the Great Exhibition, which was held in the newly constructed Crystal Palace, the worlds largest greenhouse-style exhibition hall (1 million square feet) that incorporated many of the park’s trees under its roof; it sadly burned down in 1936 but its outline can still be seen if you know where to look.The Park covers more than 340 acres and is bordered on the east by Mayfair and on the west by Kensington Gardens. To the South are all the best museums in London. This Park truly is the centre of London and encompasses the impressive Royal Albert Hall and Albert memorial on its southern fringesThe park shares a large curved lake with its western neighbour; the part of the lake in Kensington Gardens is known as the Long Water, the Hyde Park part is called the Serpentine. The lake is used for boating in the summer and skating in the winter.In the park’s northeastern corner, near Marble Arch, is Speakers’ Corner, world famous, which has long been a centre of free speech for soapbox orators. for bird lovers there is the Hudson Bird Sanctuary, for musicians a bandstand, for the thirsty a large fountain;for the arty there are two art galleries; for the horsey there are horse parades; for the sporty there are footbal games; there is also a ranger’s lodge, and, in the southeastern corner of the park, the statue of Achilles (1822), which recalls the duke of Wellington’s victories against the FrenchNot far from the statue, and nearly adjoining the park, is the Wellington Museum (1952), which is housed in a structure built in 1778. Nearby starts a celebrated riding track, Rotten Row.The park has several concerts in the summer, and the giant screens are set up for televisual events transmitted from the Royal Opera House or The Royal Albert HallYou cannot say you have visted London if you have not visited this most famous of parks!||March 22, 2015
KatB65||40||Walked here after seeing the changing of the guard. Huge, peaceful place. Plenty of room for the kids to stretch their legs and blow off some steam. They fell in love with the squirrels and managed to get some of them to come right up to them. Stopped at a cafe by one of the lakes for lunch. Simply a wonderful way to get some fresh air and relax in London.||March 21, 2015
Javagirl98||50||We had an excellent sunny day, and enjoyed a Picnic on the grass. Our girls enjoyed the wide open space good for a run. We also enjoyed the paddle boats in the lake. The memorial playground was fantastic and my kids enjoyed making new friends. ||March 20, 2015
Linze K||40||London weather changes fast, I saw bright blue sky when I started walking, after a short distance it turned dark felt like about to rain, hyde park is fun but please make sure to go on a sunny and warm day.||March 19, 2015
JohneRolfe||50||Fantastic venue to watch and join in with the top Rollerskaters in London, on a Sunday afternoon they even have a DJ they can do their syncronised moves to. Lovely paths all round the park to skate, rollerblade, cycle and walk. On Friday, Sunday and Wednesday nights in the summer they have an organised street skate out around London Town.||March 18, 2015
Kayleigh B||50||Hyde park is so peaceful and serene, loved everything about it. Children play, dog walks, swans.. i will be visiting again in August and I will surely go there again for a relaxing afternoon. ||March 18, 2015
Thankful1421||40||Strolling at Hyde Park was a welcome treat for someone who was born and has lived all her life in a tropical country like the Philippines. For a change, walking outdoors, enjoying the fresh air, feeding birds and listening to exchanges of ideas (Sunday's Speakers' Corner) were such a breeze. As an added treat, no entrance fees to pay to get in.||March 17, 2015
H-Humphrey||40||This park has so much to offer, dog walkers, joggers, horse riders, Fountains, lake, boating, picnics, walkers, strollers, kids playgrounds, just go and enjoy it all, flowers beds, rough grass areas, wildlife, waterfowl, cafes, and it is an area that you get to wander through for free.||March 17, 2015
Pedro_Duarte_85||40||excelent for a good walk and sighseeing of a full history park in London. if its a sunny day even better.||March 16, 2015
CarolAnnAstley||50||H.P. is well worth a vist when in London. ..its massive. So much space for the children to run free, children's play area's, walking trails,birds, trees refreshments. Disappointed with DIANA Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain such an Icon deserved more. Refreshments in the park expensive..take your own picnic and chill and watch the world go by.||March 16, 2015
Boing777||50||Just walk into the park to realize that is one of the best parks in the world.You can see in just one park thousand different places,you can believe to be in a different place,different Country,every where but not in London. Unbelievable||March 16, 2015
Blobs1248||50||We had a wonderful time at Hyde Park the other day. The park is beautiful and has something for everyone. There is swimming in summer, horse riding and equestrian activities, and things for children. We went to one of the children's parks and it was wonderful. Our 1-year-old really enjoyed himself. The ground has padding so kids are safe and there are activities for every age group of child - our little guy really enjoyed the slide!Visiting Hyde Park really makes for an enjoyable day and there really is something for everyone here. ||March 13, 2015
Midzey||40||A beautiful place but big. So big. Make sure you leave yourself plenty of time if you wish to walk from one end to the other. ||March 12, 2015
1AnnieEliza||50||Hyde Park is a lovely place to walk in the middle of busy London. Lovely to just stroll and relax, or to set yourself a walking tour of all the sculpture and other features to see. The Princess Diana memorial water feature is particularly peaceful, and the large sculpture of an ibis that sits right at the entrance is fabulously graceful. There are lots of other memorials in the park, you can just walk and enjoy, or learn a lot about history at the same time. And not far from one entrance is the Prince Albert Memorial, which is massive and amazing. You can also walk over to see Kensington Palace (not worth the walk-it's quite drab). Hyde Park, you can breeze through on the way to another place, or truly spend time, seeing all there is to see.||March 10, 2015
Matthew K||40||Nice open spaces for a picnic, walk or lazy day lounging in the sun (when we get it), Hyde Park is a great place to enjoy some nature while staying in central London. Make sure to try the Serpentine cafe as it's got some quite nice dishes and a lovely view over the lake.||March 10, 2015
AthensVoyager||40||All you have to do is to wear comfortable shoes and allow yourself a few hours to stroll around the park. Even if is so central it allows you to relax away from busy London. There cafes, beutiful flowers, benches to get some rest. A must see in London||March 10, 2015
Toni H||40||Such a gorgeous place. Enjoyed a very early, very sunny Sunday morning walk and the place was just so calm and relaxing. Will be returning in the summer with all the girls for a picnic||March 10, 2015
AliceeKoprowska||50||Hyde Park is amazing place when you want rat little bit and enjoy weather. I had amazing weather exactly for walking and enjoying the time. And obviously is must have in your London tour highly recommended ||March 9, 2015
farmboy68||50||I didn't really appreciate how big this park is and how well laid out it is with different sections containing memorials, gardens, open spaces and play areas.It really is a beautiful space away from the hustle and bustle, where you can grab a coffee and watch the world go by, wander around at your leisure or grab a bike and cycle...... great place.||March 9, 2015
Gillian2604||50||Whenever I visit London it always has to include a walk through Hyde Park. Generally I stay in the Paddington area to be near the station and find the park central for walking to many areas. One way you have Kensington Gardens and the palace, a short walk further is the Albert Memorial, the Royal Albert Hall and the museums. Walking in another direction you can easily get to the shops in Kensington, or walk to Marble Arch and Oxford Street. Apart from this the park itself is lovely to walk around in all seasons and caters for all ages. I love to see the horses riding through or people on their roller skates on a Sunday morning and breakfast at the café at the end of the Serpentine is a nice treat.||March 8, 2015
Daniel B||40||What a nice place. Initially I was there to see the Buckingham palace and before my trip I thought of running there. But I saw other runners and they had to mingle trough the vast amount of visitors , so you could imagine how crowded it was.||March 8, 2015
fizzles||50||The park is huge, lovely pond and plenty of areas for bike riding but the thing I liked most about the park was seeing everyone relaxing and unwinding. Such a change from the fast pace of the city to come in here and see people having picnics. having a snooze in the sun, playing with the kids. Has such a good feeling about it. Definately one of my fave places in London.||March 7, 2015
WynnMcL||50||nice big park with a lot of dogs. Cool pond in the middle as well. Lots of of space for walking and running and biking||March 6, 2015
Crikeyacroc||50||The park is absolutely gorgeous and massive. Stumbled onto it as it was right next to our hotel and had a nice scenic stroll through. Very well looked after as well which is a plus. ||March 6, 2015
TourGuy_KiteSurfer||40||Like the other parks in London, a calm, peaceful park in the middle of this metropolitan area. I wish to live in London and running at this park in the morning when I first saw it.||March 6, 2015
Tasos D||40||It's so nice to have such a big park in the middle of a megacity!In a glimpse of an eye you forget all your worries and you're chilling in the park.A lot of animals (squirrels, ducks, geese, seagulls etc)You can have a cup of coffee in one of it's shops||March 6, 2015
LQDLN||50||This is an amassing place, if you are lucky and you will have a sunny day go there for a picnic. That's the best place in London to do that.||March 6, 2015
Marie T||40||such a beautiful park to just stroll around and enjoy the views and see people enjoy themselves, lovely place||March 5, 2015
950derekm||50||Took our dogs for a lovely scenic walk through this amazingly huge park (350 acres, even bigger than Central Park in NYC with 341 acres) which is one of the capitals eight Royal parks and the best I've ever been to. Clean and well kept, full of people and dogs running around which always makes it feel homely being greeted by people from all corners of the globe we found this to be really welcoming.Amazing views and Buckingham Palace in the background as the dogs chase each other around was just blissful, many sites of interest including the famous Speakers Corner and the Diana, Princess of Wales memorial opened in 2004.A MUST VISIT!||March 5, 2015
136ivans||50||One of the best places to visit. Hyde park is very big, it has a lot of squirrels. Please buy nuts before visiting park, squirrels like them very much!||March 3, 2015
Ahm778||50||I love this park, it's very good for walking, cycling (and even you can rent one from inside the park), jogging, taking pictures, paddling boat in lovely lake, small cafe and restaurant...etc!||March 3, 2015
HayleyKe||30||We got off the bus tour at the wrong stop looking for the Natural History Museum so ended up on the other side of Hyde Park. It was late January and about zero degrees so I didn't have the best time walking through the park which I didn't realise was so big! The squirrels are friendly, too friendly you might say. Not afraid of people at all.I'm sure Hyde Park is lovely in the summer months but in the freezing cold winter, not so much.||March 1, 2015
Mark T||50||Spent a great day with friends cycling through the park. Didn't know how beautiful London scenery could be, but it's great in the park. Getting to see the corner of free speech was pretty cool too||March 1, 2015
StanStoE||40||a must for a visit, especially if you have children, although you have to wait 30 min minimum in order to get in, it worths it. There is no ticket , no cost for entrance which is amazing for such a museum. The museum embassy shops have plenty of unique things to buy. ||February 28, 2015
Sarah T||40||Came here with my daughter and loved walking through the park and eating at restaurant... Which was very busy but very nice!||February 28, 2015
elisa p||50||This 350 acre park is full of fun! You can rent a chair and relax next to the water with some food purchased at the Serpentine cafe or you can rent boats and head out on the Serpentine itself! There are gardens, fountains, statues and the Princess Diana memorial...I spent an entire day here and it is one of my most cherished family memories. For my full review and other things to do in Hyde Park check out my blog:http://thewannabegypsy.blogspot.com/||February 27, 2015
Masaishi||50||Huge, beautiful, clean like many other parks in London, but it worths a visit. There are tennis courts near the southern entrance (and I know that there are tennis coaches who you can hire to play there). We had a very good lunch at a restaurant just in front of the lake called The Serpentine. You can finish your visit going to Diana's Memorial or Kensington Palace (western side of the park).||February 26, 2015
greekcypriot2009||50||A favourite of mine, park, magical and romantic. It is the largest and one of the most beautiful parks, and it always surprises me happily with its colours depending on the season. It is never the same and every time I get to London I feel the need to drop by. Not for a picnic of course because I don’t have the time to do it, but even having a stroll and watching the people and dogs going by it is still entertaining.||February 25, 2015
Sophia T||50||This is so beautiful no matter what time of day or year that you go. It is so close to so many places and getting there is easy due to the tube. The park is near Sainsbury's, McDonald's, and Tesco so it was easy to grab a bite to eat and relax in between all the site seeing.||February 25, 2015
Chic-travellerS||50||I was fortunate enough to live with Hyde Park at the end of my road for almost 10 years and visited the park on a daily basis. I never tired of this beautiful part of London. I could happily walk for miles or sit on a bench and people watch. There are a number of small restaurants to keep you fuelled. Now I have children my daughters love Hyde Park more than anywhere else and we live close to Primrose Hill which apparently doesn't compare, have to say, I rather agree! Also a great park for all weathers.||February 24, 2015
alexp260993||40||I've been to Hyde park many times over the years, a huge, beautiful space. Whether its to spend lunch, walk a dog or simply relax for a few hours, the best time to go is (obviously) in the Summer when the weather is lovely. You can easily spend a good few hours sitting in the sun. The park, being in London, is not far from shops if you want to have a picnic or spend your lunch break with a Sainsbury's, Mcdonalds, Tesco and other shops just across the road (from Marble Arch/Oxford Street entrance). The is also a small restaurant overlooking the lake if that takes your fancy as well as small cafes all over the place. Access around the park is relatively easy due to the tube stations dotted about (Hyde Park Corner and Marble Arch are the two main stations served by Piccadilly and Central lines respectively) and there are also free toilets dotted around the park.||February 23, 2015
dmc2841||50||you could easily spend all day in hyde park. this was a second visit and will probably be a regular stop when i visit london. great place to have a picnic and it is a nice place to walk around to. theres seems to be always something going on!||February 22, 2015
Paul J||50||All of London seemed to be out in Hyde Park that day. Speakers Corner was in full swing, people rode horses and ponies, and children chased all sorts of waterfowl. It was a delightful walk, so peaceful, and we stopped at a coffee spot near the water that was jammed with cheery Londoners. Must make a pilgrimage to this great park.||February 21, 2015
DebelaBarbara||50||It's huge and beautiful, I recommend taking bike tour across lake to marble arch, you will need credit card for rent at bike station at park||February 20, 2015
moot||50||We rented Boris bikes and had a lovely cycle though the park on the dedicated cycle paths from Picadilly to the Albert Hall! . Plan to go back soon and discover more of the park on foot!||February 19, 2015
Sturla Hess B||50||Wonderful! And such green "lung" in a big city like London! Squirrels, ducks, seagulls, dogs - and people :-)||February 19, 2015
Cookster_11||50||i loved having a long run around Hyde park. It was such fun running past the Albert memorial, Kensington Palace and the serpentine. After the crowds down boring old Oxford street, it was literally a breath of fresh air. All be it a puffed one!. It would have been nicer in summer and not an old grey winters day, but blew off the depression that hangs over this city in the winter||February 19, 2015
smiler1308||40||Went into Hyde park at the end of our 3 day London trip, and the quiet waters of the Princess Diana memorial fountain in Hyde park was a welcome to our ears. Found a lovely play area afterwards, bit further on towards Hyde Park Corner. ||February 18, 2015
Joelle C||50||Love walking round here. Great for families and just to go walked round plenty of times. and its just beautiful. Nice atmosphere everyone really happy||February 18, 2015
EdaErdin||50||We finished our day in Hyde park. Even though we were too tired to walk, the beauty of the park made us keep going. The lake in the middle with swans and ducks is so beautiful. I'd say the best time to visit it is in the afternoon when sun starts to set. It creates a perfect reflection on the garden as well as on the lake. Like a dream!||February 18, 2015
AngieP49||50||Whilst staying in London our hotel was just across the road from Hyde Park so we decided to take a morning stroll through.The park is surrounded by a high wall and entrance is via various gates which are locked at night.It is a great place to walk, run or exercise your dog.Because it was Sunday morning there were lots of people enjoying the park which has lots of grassed areas, old trees and some interesting statues.The park is very peaceful and it is easy to forget that you are in London.We walked straight across from Lancaster Gate to the Royal Albert Hall, there are paths going off in various directions and they are all well signposted. There are also large maps at the entrances so you can work out where you are and what you would like to see in the park.A lovely place to visit when you are in the capital.||February 17, 2015
marg626||40||Right near the train station and the perfect walk to take on the way to see Buckingham Palace. Hyde Park had so many active people running and exercising, but it was so large that I never had to worry about being in someones way. There were open fields of grass, fields of flowers, fountains, and many pathways leading to so much more. It will take about 20 minutes to walk directly through it, but at a peaceful pace it will take about 35 minutes.||February 17, 2015
PawelWod||50||Everybody go fast, missing You by. People go to work, hurry up to take a tube etc. And You can enter the Hyde Park gate and in a moment You are in a different world. Big green area (I was in winter so the greenery was not so rich and impressive), with some nice buildings, waterfalls, lake etc. Everybody can find something here. During spring and summer it must be great!||February 16, 2015
302samanthas||50||We had a lovely after noon here after a busy science museum visit. We walked right across and saw all the Royal sites! Was surprising how much you could do that cost nothing!! Was a lovely way to end our weekend break in London and only a short walk to Victoria Coach Station. Kids enjoyed seeing the Royal Guards.||February 16, 2015
Swannynz||50||Enjoyed the arch, but the surroundings contain the NZ and Australian war memorials so it makes it worth the look. Close to everything and easy to get to, a must see for all the attractions||February 15, 2015
Nikisha17||50||A nice park to take a walk through to get away from the busy city for a while, also does concerts during summer. ||February 14, 2015
armadeus||50||Hyde Park is a very large park which can be enjoyed by any age. There are numerous statues, fountains, gardens, birds and squirrels. Children can run and play whilst adults can walk, run or just sit and relax. The gardens are quite colourful during summer. The park is close to a number of attractions and can easily be accessed by travel on the Hop on Hop off bus or via the tube underground. There are numerous memorials throughout the park including Princess Diana and the London bombings. On a corner of the park is the Australian War I Memorial for World War I and II. It lists names of the towns in which those who made the sacrifice were born. It also lists most of the battles Australians were engaged in.||February 14, 2015
TonyB932||50||I was staying nearby for a week so thought I would try Hyde Park for early morning walks. Whilst it was a bit cold there were still plenty of people out exercising and there were plenty of animals out and about including squirrels running across the lawns. I can imagine it would be absolutely amazing in warmer weather. Fantastic park and well worth taking the time to visit.||February 14, 2015
Anke M||50||We walked through Hyde park to go visit the Natural History Museum and it was sure worth the walk. It was really clean and the animals (especially the squirrels) come so close to you, you can just touch them. Really nice walk.||February 13, 2015
CBAndrewB||50||If you need some green space, this is the place. I ran along the horse trails and within the horse path. It's very quiet in this area, surrounded by an abundance of people. Sundays are busy, but at least there's plenty of elbow room here. ||February 12, 2015
Maria B||50|| Best park I have ever visited!!You may be lucky enough to see horses with their horse riders, squirrels or you may just follow the path for a walk amongst the trees and gardens or you may have a great jogging training!!!||February 11, 2015
Gerrit K||40||Amazing to find a large green park in the middle of this great city. Recommended to enjoy a "pick nick lunch" optional chair rental, but even more relaxing to sit on the grass. A lot of famous buildings in walking distance.||February 10, 2015
ERIKA G||50||Hyde Park it's one of my favorite attractions in London during Christmas time.Over this time they have a Christmas Wonderland fair that's really fun to enjoy either with your family, friends, or boyfriend.You can have food, live music, shop, drink beer, enjoy the amusement park and it's a really fun program to enjoy during the day.||February 10, 2015
CLW43||40||A great place to get some fresh air and have a good walk with lots to see especially the serpentine area. I walked from London Victoria to Lancaster Gate tube and it took me 35 mins and was much nicer than taking the tube. There are working on improving a section of the park and a section was closed off to the public but there is still plenty of space.||February 10, 2015
Cheerfulsue||20||The Winter Wonderland in Hyde park was dangerously overcrowded, there was a scrum to get and out if the park. Very expensive for the beers and food, although some of the stands are mildly interesting. Toilets were absolutely vile. Would not recommend.||February 9, 2015
angela632015||50||After late breakfast peaceful stroll around the Serpentine, light lunch, glass of wine and a little sunshine. ||February 9, 2015
Jasmine B||50||Extremely hot day when I visited, got sunburnt! Had a lovely atmosphere, loads of people having a great time. Lovely walks and lots of shade. Nice things to do and overall is lovely and a must do. So unlike the busy streets of London, good to relax with friends||February 8, 2015
Mypace||40||It was a cold sunny day. Instead of taking a transport, I opted to walk briskly. The paved path was well marked and I came past the Serpentine Lake, a popular spot for boating, a nice restaurant and generally a weekend spot for many visitors.The bridge to Kensington Gardens was interesting. I got the sun most of the way as the trees were bare and gave not much shade.I made it comfortably in 30 minutes.||February 7, 2015
Naureen Y||40||We visited twice the amazing park located in the heart of the Central London.Very easy to get there as five tube stations are connected to all corners of the park and numerous buses just drop you outside the park.In the winter it serves as a home to Winter Wonderland,which was a free entry Christmas market and a funfair with lots of joy rides and food options.We enjoyed a lot while our visit to the wonderland.Our next visit was on Christmas day which displayed the serenity and beauty of the park to us.You can just do cycling, walk or sit by the lake to do Bird watching.We loved feeding the Geese,Swans and ducks and enjoyed them swimming.Also it was a fun to see the Peter Pan statue and see Diana's Memorial.Before leaving dont forget to visit the Italian Garden and Serpentine Lake.||February 7, 2015
prettydelight||40||Every time we visit Hyde Park we enjoy the experience. From the walk around the serpentine, to Winter wonderland near Christmas . The park is well maintained all year and all can enjoy. People watching is great at the weekend with the roller blades performing . I would recommend to anyone visiting to spend sometime in the park .||February 7, 2015
José Luis F||50||I really love The Park , I usually walk in The park, and it is very relaxing.You have a wonderful lagoon, little squirrels, it my favorite Park in London !!||February 6, 2015
Michal T||40||Very nice park with a lot of amenities, suitable for runners or just for a short walk,involves a lake and gardens,accesible from Hyde Park Corner-Piccadily line or Central line. Our visit messed just a bad weather||February 6, 2015
carlitoshdz||40||We visited this park on christmas day, all the attractions were very nice. The german village was great with all the german sausages and the beer. The ice rink was closed so we had to go somewhere else. Still it was very nice. The ice bar and the ice rink younhave to buy the tickets like a week before online because theres no way to go in buying the tickets there is always sold out.Very recommended.||February 5, 2015
ChicaVoya||50||One of Henry VIII's hunting grounds, there's certainly an air of majesty and heritage about Hyde Park. Bordered by some of the most refined and culturally rich neighbourhoods in London (Mayfair, Knightsbridge, Kensington and Bayswater), it serves as the verdant playground for the residents of each of these thriving village communities, as well as an essential landmark on the itinerary of any visitor to London. From boating on the Serpentine to lounging around the Italian Gardens to cycling up to the Albert Memorial, Hyde Park is a beautiful place to spend a leisurely summer afternoon.||February 3, 2015
Smile_love||50||Hyde park winter wonderland is a must! It's a massive Christmas paradise. German Christmas markets and food stalls, I've bar and lots of rides! It's great I shall go every year! But book online this time as it was so busy and the ice kingdom had sold out of tickets :( ||February 3, 2015
Auyon||50||Up there with Regent's Park as the best park in London, though this is larger. Great place to go for a walk, bike around, eat, chill out.||February 2, 2015
Keith J||40||Stretching from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade there is a lot to see. Pall Mall runs down the full length of one side, many ponds with ducks to feed, loads of places tonsitbon seats, deck chairs (chargeable) and on the grass if dry and warm. Cafe's available and some magnificent buildings all around you. Trafalgar Square and Nelsons Column is at the top under the arch.||February 2, 2015
Sally T||40||Walked through Hyde Park on our way to visit the statue of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. We headed back to Buckingham Palace for the changing of the Guard, but I would have loved to just sit and watch the ducks and swans, or rented a boat to go out on the Serpentine.||January 31, 2015
Jordanovichy||40||Hyde Park is great for a nice, peaceful walk through to take the strain out of a day in England's capital. You can sit by the large ponds and watch the ducks or walk around looking at London's tall buildings in the distance.It isn't always peaceful! Especially in the summer, Hyde Park hosts some excellent concerts, some even with free entry so look out for those to avoid/join in with depending on what you want to do.Every winter, from late November to early January, Hyde Park is home to a Winter Wonderland, a free entry fair with many rides and attractions including a large ferris wheel, roller coasters, fun houses and the like. Not to be missed!||January 30, 2015
Alan W||40||It was nice to see more than just a tree and fell the grass beneath my feet. I was able to enjoy a nice conversation while feeling I was out of the city... If only for an hour.There are also monuments and small ponds to take you away.||January 29, 2015
Springer3921||50||I visited Hyde Park in December for Winter Wonderland and it was such a nice experience! A section of the Park is turned into literally a Winter Wonderland! It's a mix between a christmas market and a fun fair. There are little huts selling everything christmassy including baubles and ornaments, I was very surprised at how reasonably priced some of the stalls were! There were food and drink stalls, there was a carousel bar. In the funfair part they had things for both children and adults, my favourite was an ice castle. This was a dome full of ice statues (It was freezing!), you had to pay extra but it was a really good experience. I am already planning my next trip to London in December this year so I can go to the Winter Wonderland again!||January 28, 2015
Whitewolf777||50||After walking around the busy London Town, and visiting the sightseeing sights, it was a pleasant experience walking through Hyde Park, which is a recommended part of the sightseeing experience. Hyde park is very peaceful, clean & lovely sceneries. and is lovely to get away from it all.||January 27, 2015
Emily4023||40||It was gorgeous in the summer when I visited London several years ago. A bit different in December - definitely visit in the summer, but can skip in the winter.||January 27, 2015
Jolyon67||40||Hyde Park is the perfect place to catch your breath after shopping or sightseeing in London. Hyde Park Corner or better still Marble Arch are the best tube stations to access the park. South Carriage Row, the long dusty path along the southern edge of the park was once the site of the 1851 Great Exhibition where the original Crystal Palace stood. You really get a sense of how large it was as you walk along. There are a few information panels about it along the way. A more recent historical event is marked near Park Lane. Look out for the memorial to the victims of the London 7/7 bombings.||January 26, 2015
stav2015||50||It was a great experience to walk through Hude Park in January. Although cold, the park atmosphere was very nice and inspiring. Highly recommended ||January 25, 2015
cayleecathrina||50||Hyde park is truly a natural beauty .All the parts of that park is just so stunning. Hyde park is a place to relax , have fun , read a book , and to excercise . Joy is one of the names people should call hyde park . There are beautiful sceneries in that park. ||January 24, 2015
KinnittyCastleHotel||50||The Christmas Markets here in London are probably the best there is, amusements, great food and warm drinks from all over the world. bespoke gifts and Ice skating, it really puts you in the mood for the festivities and I would love to go again ||January 24, 2015
Cinnastickz||50||London's is peppered with recreational spaces around town, but Hyde Park is not to be missed. You could easily spend a good part of a day here as there is so much to take in. Rent a row or pedal boat and enjoy some time on the Serpentine lake. Search for all 16 fountains, statues monuments including Diana's memorial. Plan a picnic among the old trees or watch all the swans, ducks and geese swim in one of water features. Jog along the old trees at sunrise, take your children run around one of the many playgrounds or relax in the park deck chairs. Plus Kensington Gardens and Palace is right next door. It's easy to get to with five tube station along its borders and is beautiful anytime of year, offering something for everyone.||January 23, 2015
srefsdfsdfsdf .||50||I love this park.This is THE park to go to in London, you can hire a Barclay's bike and ride around some of (most of) the paths.Walk around and try to find and capture all the statues (including Peter Pan)Or just hang out on the grass and enjoy a picnic or watch the ducks and swans on the lake.Something for everyone||January 22, 2015
Liz H||50||As someone who has lived close to London for most of her life I have visited Hyde Park many times but never on a Sunday to "Speakers' Corner". Recently I was in London overnight from Saturday to Sunday. What an opportunity! So, come 9.00 on Sunday I dragged my husband and my son some distance from Mayfair to Speakers' Corner. People are allowed to speak there - freedom of speech reigns ......or it used to. Perhaps I am living in the past. Years ago there would be someone - or many people - speaking every Sunday. My excitement had mounted only to be dashed. Not one person. Why? Or why not? Are people scared? Do people not go out in the winter? Has a great British attraction died? What a disappointment. It is in the guidebooks - yes, I read them to see what is recommended for visitors. This can no longer be regarded as an attraction in London. That really saddens me. Hyde Park, of course, despite being populated by joggers, remains glorious.||January 22, 2015
jbparker2||50||Beautiful park - we walked from Kensington Gardens through Hyde Park to Buckingham Palace. Hyde Park is full of wonderful surprises from the cheeky squirrels, white swans, lake & very old trees. Well worth a visit in all seasons.||January 20, 2015
KrisD_pl||30||... probably much better in spring or summer when in bloom. December attractions included winter amusement park, some squirrels and unexpectedly a lot of birds - some very interesting. So, at least winter visit may be fun for bird watchers.||January 19, 2015
Lauren N||50||Hyde Park is a lovely place to go for a walk in London. We decided to visit Buckingham Palace and then walk through Hyde Park to get to Speakers Corner which was easy access to Oxford Street for shopping. The sites are lovely and there are plenty of kiosks located around the park incase you get peckish or need a drink. My favourite experience of Hyde Park is feeding the Squirrels, they are so friendly and they often come up to you and climb on you. I think Hyde Park is one of the only places in London that you could go to and forget that you are in a busy city, its so peaceful. ||January 19, 2015
chrismalkinuk||50||We visited London last weekend, I love Hyde Park. my girlfriend and I decided to have a Harrods picnic in the park of a hot roast beef sandwich and a drink....absolute bliss, just sitting on the park bench watching the world go by||January 18, 2015
Bumble1980||50||I was worried It may still be busy but was a great experience on the 3rd jan no queues could get to the bars to drink. The firepit bar was good and with music and ice kingdom and wheel were great to see at night||January 18, 2015
Marine L||40||Beautiful park, Yet, to British for me. To neat, to organised.Nature had no place to grow on its own in Hyde Park. But I guess it is the local genre.||January 18, 2015
Haley H||50||This park is huge but it's not hugely busy and there are lots of adorable little squirrels willing to eat straight out of your hand. Lots of other wildlife as well, such as ducks and swans and LOTS of pigeons||January 18, 2015
Mustangsally1985||50||Provided you have decent weather...Hyde Park is gloriously relaxing and beautiful. To just sit on an empty park bench and people watch while taking in the breath and air that is London, it is truly a gem. I could sit and while away for hours here on a sunny day and never thought a moment was wasted.||January 16, 2015
thewillow||50||Just like Kensington Gardens walk and walk at your leisure and enjoy the trees, squirrels and birds, sit and people watch or watch others playing soccer of riding bikes. At times there will be horses being exercised (watch out for their droppings !!! ) There is the Serpentine Lake & a couple of restaurants over looking them if you like to dine there. Princess Diana Memorial is a short walk away and so is the famous Peter Pan statue.||January 14, 2015
Solicas||40||Very beautiful and well maintained. Make sure you have plenty of time to walk around it. You can go see the Kensigton Palace and Princess Diana's memorial fountain and you can also walk to Buckingham Palace from here.||January 13, 2015
cjbfan||50||We spent a nice afternoon walking through Hyde Park. It was relatively quiet after the city streets. Nice lake path and lots of green grass. ||January 13, 2015
ESK71||40||Best place for a long walk, chat and coffee with a good friend. Quiet and peaceful place in the very centre of the city. Relaxing stop while London sightseeing. I can also imagine cycling there with my kids very often (if we lived there...). Really meaninful place.||January 11, 2015
Sabine S||50||You can't believe how big it is, and if you want a walk in the green you could do it for 2-3 hours.You don't have to be afraid, if you walk through at night. Lights are all over.It's the best place to find a break from the city. Love it.||January 9, 2015
sharon w||50||Hyde Park is a park you are naturally drawn to whilst you are visiting the city of London. It's many iconic spots include The Serpentine River, Kensington Palace & Speakers Corner. These are all worth the effort on their own but surprisingly you find gems like Squirrels foraging around the park, Harrods Department store is only a short stroll away. But the most amazing spot is sitting yourself down on a park bench or picnic rug and watching the people coming and going about their business. A feast for the eyes and the soul. Enjoy the ride and it's free!!||January 9, 2015
tahoequeen21||50||My favorite part of London is that even though it's a big city, they have so many wonderful parks. We enjoyed walking through here and seeing the beautiful birds and ducks by the pond.The restroom facilities were clean.It''s nice to see where so many movies have been filmed. A nice way to relax before or after a day of sightseeing.||January 8, 2015
Lihtsalt K||40||Beautiful park. They had those sun bating chairs where you can sit and lie down and enjoy the view. Nice place to relax and have a nice picnic.||January 7, 2015
Richard E||50||For being in the winter, it was quite busy with lots of people, many booths of food, handicrafts and carnival rides. Ice sculptures were quite interesting.||January 6, 2015
Jessica B||50||The French my know how to do museums but the English know their parks. Great strolling landscape. Went to the Barclay British Summertime series and was amazed at the cleanliness and layout.||January 4, 2015
Mister J||50||One or two people on here say Hyde Park is a bit boring and there are not that many people around, I think you have to take into account the scale and size of the place and also 'factor in' that there are numerous cafes, walks, a huge lake with boats (and even swimming in the Lido in the Summer although there was a 'no swimming' sign when we visited in January. You can ride bikes around and take some fresh air in an otherwise very busy and congested city centre. The only 'downside' are the awful parking charges, for example Q Parking on Park Lane = £11 for 2 hours, £28 per day, not worth it !||January 4, 2015
JBLISBOA||50||Hyde Park - during Summer, because of English weather - is the ideal place to walkaround, have a coffee / snack on, jogging, rent a small rowing boat, art galleries, monuments, just lay down and relax.... real nature right in the middle of London.||January 3, 2015
artsman||50||Depending on your definitions about 20% of London is open space. Either way it is very green compared with many cities and can now add the Olympic Park to the total. Hyde Park/Kensington garden is a decent size stretching from Mayfair to Notting Hill and Kensington. It has everything. Formal gardens, a river, a lake, a gallery,monuments gallore, places to eat and drink a Royal Palace. It also has wildlife, lovers and nannies. A great space in the world's greatest city!||January 2, 2015
CorneliusfudgeGM||40||As Hyde Park was only 30 minute walk from our hotel we decided to walk there with champagne to see in 2015 on New Years Eve. We headed for the bridge over the Serpentine where the London Eye could be seen in the distance. We were not alone with maybe 100 or so doing the same. A great vantage point if you don't mind seeing the fireworks in the distance.||January 1, 2015
Petros B||30||The positives are that the rides are plenty and enjoying, and that the organisation seems quite good (facilities, safety, positioning of the tills etc).However, apart from the cost which can be enormous for a family (4-5 tokens (ie, £4 to £5) as a minimum per person per ride), the first ride on the left, called something like "Hotel Alpen" has some pictures inside that I think are not very appropriate for young children.||January 1, 2015
Steven_Lam||30||I stayed at a nearby hotel and decided to spend my last morning before leaving London strolling through the park. For a someone who lives in an urban cityscape, it was nice to be surrounded by nothing but trees and grass. As a bonus, I took some wonderful snaps of the squirrels, who were obviously not afraid of humans.||December 30, 2014
TheShis||30||We were a bit disappointed from our visit to Hyde park.I was a nice stroll among the lovely greens, but renting anything on the lake was way too expensive.There were not THAT many people there, which was a bit surprising, as it was a very warm summer day.The Speakers' Corner on Sunday was a bit disappointing and rather boring.Don't miss the beautiful and moving "Animals in War" memorial.||December 29, 2014
cath2991||50||Admittedly, I have only been to Hyde Park in winter, in the dark and to go to Winter Wonderland so can't really comment on the park itself but WW is so worth visiting if you can. Entrance was free but the rides ranged in price from £4 each to £8+ so if you're bringing children be sure to bring plenty of cash but leave some spare for the delicious food and stalls selling the usual Xmas market items. It was very busy so expect to queue for the rides but still very enjoyable and I will definitely be returning!||December 28, 2014
stevef569||40||This is a great place to pop to if you want to avoid the hustle and bustle of the city . The boats are fun to take out if a little expensive. Best way is a brisk walk around which allows you all the time in the world to take in all the glorious colours Mother Nature has to offer ||December 28, 2014
avidtripper2||30||Hyde Park itself is a lovely park but no different to any other apart from being busy with tourists.The Winter Wonderland and Xmas market is the same format as in every other city in the UK. The food was overpriced and £5 for the most vile german hotdog I have ever tasted put me off eating from any of the other outlets. The stalls were selling the same stuff as the stalls in Cardiff, Swansea and all other towns and cities throughout the UK. There was nothing much different to see and the only difference was that there was more of it and the prices were inflated to rip off tourists who thought they were buying something unique. I bought cuter decorations at a much better price in accesorize in Convent Garden. Its worth a wander to experience the atmosphere but avoid the german hot dog stall at all costs!||December 27, 2014
Melissa P||50||I have been to Winter Wonderland for two years running now with my good friends and had a fab time, lovely chritmas stalls, food fro around the world, a fun reindeer race game, lots of rides if they are your thing. The ice rink and a great atmosphere. I would definately recommend it, but if taking children stick to a budget unless you have an endless supply of money.||December 27, 2014
969sidney||50||We have many parks in London, but one of biggest and absolutely my favourite is the famous Hide Park! You can relax here walking through the nice lake seeing the funny ducks or simply seat and read a book. Perfect place for families and in the winter also home for the stunning Winterland amusement park!||December 26, 2014
lahem88||50||I have enjoyed with my family and my kids visit this park where it combines the beauty of nature with the bustle ,We enjoyed a tour of the lake rowing on the boat but the weather was rainy,my son, Faisal enjoy playing with pigeons and ducks,Access to the park for free and there are restaurants and cafes.Your visit to London would not be complete unless you visited this park.||December 24, 2014
3406E||30||While on our walk to Buckingham Palace we walked through Hyde Park. Quite peaceful & a large patch of greenery in the concrete jungle. One of the best things is that it is free :)||December 23, 2014
Countryfiles||50||Went for Winter Wonderland. Fantastically laid out with lots of activities and fair rides for the children along with an Ice Kingdom, Ice Rink, Great Wheel and a Circus. There are lots of festive market stalls with lovely goods and some superb food and drinks. We had lunch there and for two adults it cost 11.00. Drinks averaged between 4 and 5.00 per pint or mulled wine. We went on the carousel bar which had a horse with a table attached to it and went gently round whilst you had a drink. The snow house was lovely too. There were rides for all ages. We got there at 9.45 am and did not need to queue as we had an attraction ticket. It opens at 10.00 and closes at 10.00 pm. A full day is easily had. The park itself is beautiful and has various cafes to purchase a coffee etc at. Superb day out and great attractions.||December 23, 2014
deFreuleA||50||Spring, summer, fall or winter: Hyde park is one of my favorite places to go to if tired of the hustle and bustle of a busy city.plenty of space to just stroll along, or just sit on a bench watching dogs chase the squirrels, or just a ball.||December 23, 2014
Bradley C||10||Absolutely disgraceful. Second year in a row that my Ice Skating session has been cancelled due to their inability to maintain the Rink because of the weather. Yet again I've been given a mere matter of hours notice and my partner, whom has flown from another country to specifically attend today's activity at Winter Wonderland, and I feel severely let down.||December 23, 2014
LLLLJLJL||20||We found Hyde Park to look lovely but far too busy and far too expensive! For us this didn't make us feel Christmasy and overall was not a great experience. Walking from here to Oxford Street and beyond made our day worth while.||December 22, 2014
Alexandros M||50||An amazing park!!! you can spend many hours to make your walk or to relax and the best part is that is only 10 minutes from the heart of London!!!||December 22, 2014
Edward2651||50||We visited London in March and went to all the parks. Hyde Park was one of them We even managed to locate and see the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain which is very nice and a moving tribute to her short life (a life cut short way to early but one which still made its mark throughout the world!). The fountain ebbs and flows like Diana's life itself. The park is a huge expanse of green - not my favorite of the London parks but still quite nice to walk through.||December 21, 2014
Roadster2015||40||In my view this is the best park in London and one can do any activity here.There are most of the times special theme events taking place.||December 21, 2014
brernick||40||I was traveling and had heard about the radio control sailboats that sail at the round pond. There was no hurry to get there so it was a slow very scenic and enjoyable walk. It was a Sunday afternoon and the park was alive with all ages just enjoying the outdoors. I enjoyed watching the six foot long boats from the local Radio control sail. If you have some extra time on your visit to London spend it at Hyde Park you will be glad you did.||December 20, 2014
adrianpritcha72||10||£9 per ride?!?! The Park was so crowded simply getting around was extremely unpleasant, that along with the cumbersome "token" system whereby you buy and then exchange plastic coins with a hostile attendant probably on minimum wage made it anything but a "Wonderland" !||December 20, 2014
Judy1705||10||I had ice skating booked today for my daughter and ten of her friends for her birthday. She heard from a friend that they had received an email saying skating was cancelled. There was nothing on Facebook to say this and I hadn't been contacted. I therefore emailed, face booked and tweeted the company to see if it was cancelled and was told that if I hadn't been notified her 21.00 session was going ahead. We all travelled to London excited, 17.29 text received session cancelled. What makes it worse is that it is closed for two days, since yesterday and the company knew this all along and didn't share that information with me. Totally let down.||December 19, 2014
FireSpitter||40||Interesting place to visit during the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland. Nice stalls with festive offerings but a tad or two, overly expensive.||December 18, 2014
RowanH336||50||At 145 hectares, Hyde Park is one of London’s largest parks. It contains a large body of water, the Serpentine which contains a number of poultry including swans, geese, ducks and water fowl who happily feed off provided food. It also contains a small number of restaurants and watercraft to enjoy on a sunny day. It’s wonderful to come here on a nice day and feed the swans and I would recommend bringing a loaf of bread to feed the poultry. Be sure to go to Hyde Park Corner to see various other attractions including the Australian War Memorial, Bomber command memorial, Royal artillery memorial, New Zealand war memorial and Wellington monument.||December 17, 2014
70ish||50||This is a lovely park any time of the year but this weekend it was quite magical with the Winter Wonderland It was a lovely sunny day and the fair and Christmas market was very enjoyable. We then walked to the Speakers Corner Cafe and had a very good cup of tea and sat people watching for a bit||December 15, 2014
Shirley H||30||Over priced and over rated, stalls all much the same, food stall galore ,carry on walking through the winter wonderland and you will come to a beautiful park and boating lake much nicer than the hype of winter wonderland ||December 15, 2014
Jens H||40||We went with some friends and as it was a weekend, we prebooked a VIP box with Champagne for 4 people at about £100 total at Cirque Beserk for a 1 hour evening performance. The ticket also gives you fastlane access into the park, which was a bonus as the queue was fairly long. Quite a large Christmas Market and Fair with some great rides, but wherever possible it's worth prebooking online to get the most out of your experience. Once we had sampled a few treats and walked (a lot!) it was time to warm up in the circus tent and enjoy a bit of bubbly before heading home. If like us you are in a small group driving to London, then you might also consider the Park Lane underground car park which borders Hyde Park and is within 5 minutes drive of the A40/M40. This also avoids the Congestion zone and can be prebooked online. On the other hand if you already are in London, as the entrance to Hyde Park and the Wonderland is free, you could enjoy the festive ambiance and live music without spending a penny....but you will be tempted by the Bavarian beers,sausages, pretzels and waffles!||December 15, 2014
Mohammed A||50||Visitied this time in winter and found a great attraction in the park called winter wonderland. It is a good place for different rides for adults and kids as well. Also manu restaurants are exist in the site. The weekend is very busy so be careful planning your next trip.||December 15, 2014
Ian D||50||This as many people probably have already heard is one of the most famous public parks in the world. (As well as probably one of the best in my opinion.)It's often refered to as 'the lungs of London' in many cases, and in just one visit you'll be able to see why.Being very conveniently central and also accessable from several main locations. Is a place where you could actually spend almost a whole day strolling and soaking up the atmosphere (depending on what time of the year you're visiting).The best time I find is usually from late Spring to early Autumn. When like most public parks it's in full bloom and the weather tends to be more reliable.It incorporates numerous attractions including the famous Speakers Corner (nr Marble Arch), the Achilles Monument (nr Hyde Park Corner), the Princess Diana Memorial and Childrens Playground & Serpentine Boating Lake (which was used as one of the venues for the London Olympics).It also connects you to several different areas in the Central Zone such as Knightsbridge/Brompton/Queensway/Notting Hill/ Bayswater & Mayfair, and also adjoins to nearby Kensington Gardens. With the busiest times of the year tending to be early July to late September (can be pretty heaving at times due to a number of open air rock concerts being staged.) Which as you can gather has attracted some of the most famous names past and present. (I also heard that it used to be one of our famous monarchs HENRY VIII's favourite hunting grounds.)At the latter end of the year (from late November to very early January). It has played host over the last few years to the pretty unique Winter Wonderland Experience for the festive season (this is well worth a visit).So if you want a picturesque centrally located attraction that'll give you fond memories for all seasons on your visit to London. Then this one's definitely not to missed off your itinerary.||December 14, 2014
Tom L||40||Hyde Park is deceptively big and you can spend all day in it quite easily. Plenty to see and do including winter wonderland, duck and geese feeding, memorials and just killing time in general. Be a bit more careful at night, some areas are poorly lit particularly nearer the middle of the park.||December 13, 2014
Imraansurve||40||The ambience at this iconic park in London is simply amazing. It's a huge space in the centre of London and on a nice sunny day you see tourists and local both enjoying the weather.Rent a bike or take a walk - a must see for every visitor to London - we go there for a while on ecery trip||December 12, 2014
Ally83||40||Well knowing it can be busy at the weekends my husband took a Friday off. We went to Hamleys in the a.m followed by a nice lunch then walked down Oxford street to the Wonderland at about 2p.m. No queue to get in, nobody jostling us or squashing my son in the buggy, no queue for the toilets no queues for the rides. It was busy but we had no problem doing anything we wanted to do.  I only gave it four stars as two mulled wines in the carousel bars were £10!! I know London is pricey but that is crazy!  Will return next year, our 15 months old loved the lights and music and was bopping along. We left about 4.30 It was starting to get a bit busier but no queue to get in still.  Read the website before you go and if you go at the weekend go in the morning and you will have a fab time :)||December 12, 2014

platform327||40||Have never visited a winter wonderland, or gone ice skating before. Loved every minute of the experience. The place is so big it required two visits on the same day. Can recommend skating during the day as much quiter. Entire site looks amazing by night too. ||December 11, 2014
K_enjoying_life||40||This great park is the best park in central London. It is huge and offers various settings for leisure and relaxing. Do visit Kensingtson Palace/ gardens when you are here. ||December 11, 2014
Ted B||50||A visit here is a must.Go to Speakers Corner.Stand up and speak to the public or just listen to others.Its a national institution.The Park is well laid out and a pleasure to stroll through.||December 10, 2014
ADsMum||40||As day trippers to London, looking to enjoy the best the capital could offer for the festive season, we found ourselves at Hyde Park Winter Winderland. Not really sure what to expect, but in contrast to what we are offered locally, this is a pleasure.Lots of chalets, a mixture of gifts and refreshments, you don't need to indulge to enjoy the experience. As you get further into the 'village' the gift chalets make way for fairground rides, and again, these don't fail to impress, being of a similar scale to those found at most provisional theme parks! Rides are paid for with tokens, purchased at centralised kiosks and seem fairly average in price. There are various paid attractions which we avoided, having only visited to get a feel for it all. A one-way system operates and the security staff try their best to enforce this, however it is busy and therefore people do occasionally ignore it. We visited at lunchtime on Sunday and although it was busy, it was not uncomfortably so, though obviously the number of visitors can increase significantly closer to Christmas.||December 10, 2014
Barry D||40||Normally travel to Europe for Christmas Markets but this year decided to take all of the family to The Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. We visited during weekdays and found it easy to move around up until about 4.30 pm. After this time it became very busy but still worthy of a visit. We attended Zippos Family Circus, went for a ride on the Giant Observation Wheel and visited the Magical Ice Kingdom. All were reasonably good but the circus was excellent. All were quite expensive (information on cost available on www.hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/tickets. There were also a very large number of Bavarian style wooden chalets selling an extensive range of food, drinks and gifts. Additionally, there were fair rides for all. Our visit covered several days and we were pleasantly surprised of how good everything was. Didn't quite meet the standards of other markets visited throughout Europe but certainly beat some and without doubt easily surpassed a number within the UK. The actual entrance to Winter Wonderland is free. Certainly worthy of a visit and recommended as such.||December 10, 2014
carolelong2014||50||It there until after Christmas. Free to get in. Loads of rides, street food, stalls to buy stuff. Its absolutely huge. A great day or night out. It all twinkling lights festive stuff, rides for the kids and adults. And its all next door to the Serpentine where you can feed the beautiful swans.Short of money - take a packed lunch and a thermos flask. You'll love it I promise.||December 9, 2014
Aren2||40||On our last day in London on a short break, we decided to walk through Hyde Park on our way to the train station before returning home. It's a lovely open space right in the heart of London, very close to Oxford Street, Marble Arch, and also Buckingham Palace and Paddington railway station. At the end of Oxford Street, just before you get to Marble Arch there is a wonderful coffee shop serving warm croissants, pain chocolat, and good coffee. There are lots of different places to walk, for dog walking or romantic walks, or just a solitary place to go and lose yourself for a few hours away from it all. On the day we were there, they were setting up for the triathlon event, so there were lots of organisers there and tv crews setting up. But this wasn't intrusive. Our best moment came when we sat down for a short break, saw some grey squirrels who appeared quite friendly and came up to us for a bit of our food, eating out of our hands even.Then my partner said, hey there's a red squirrel. Don't be silly I said, there aren't any left in the UK. But sure enough, there was. And it got really close to us, also eating out of my hand. It can be a little hard working out your way around the park, due to its shear size and the maps are few and far between.||December 8, 2014
Ch4rlie40||10||What an awful place, don't bother if you're thinking of getting into the Christmas sprit, it's an expensive funfair with repeated stalls, selling over priced rubbish. Wasted my time ||December 8, 2014
UKC0uple||30||We booked a coach especially to visit Winter Wonderland. It was a cold damp day last Thursday as we wondered round the enclosed area the poor stall holders were stood waiting for custom but the weather was the problem. we were wanting to go into the Ice Bar BUT it was booked fully for the Day. So we went for The Magical Ice Kingdom but when I asked for two tickets for the off peak time which is advertised at £6.00 for concessions we were told off peak only is available on and after 2nd January 2015 at £9.00 each. So we declined as we thought it too expensive as were many more stalls, food and drinks. We left disappointed and will avoid next year.||December 8, 2014
audiowhh||20||Just been to Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, hmmmm anything but that.I knew it would be packed so had looked up what was there and on website it showed magical ice kingdom as a ride and walk through forest. Paid for tickets ( not cheap) get force our way through all the people and when we got to ice kingdom it was not a ride through, staff kept telling people to move along all the time, so not much time to look at ice sculptors , which were beautiful . Doubt we were in there for more then 10 mins. Rip off prices £4 for a small hot chocolate, half hour wait for hotdog, will never go again or reconmmend, seems it is just there to rip people off.||December 7, 2014
Laura B||50||One of the best experiences of my life as there is so much to see and do!There is free entry into the park and an array of trinket stalls, food stalls, beer tents, funfair rides and Christmas crafts on offer.Not only will u leave feeling stuffed, you will also leave with lots of additional gifts for loved ones.The only problem was that the crowd was massive and quite a bit of your time was spent shuffling around the miles of market available. However, do not let this put you off. This is definitely the highlight of my Christmas.||December 7, 2014
Sara S||40||We hit Winter Wonderland at 4.30 Saturday Afternoon, I was really looking forward to the experience and I was not disappointed! Yes it was packed but what did I expect! We joined the cue and it was not a problem as everyone was in a festive mood, signing carols. Once we entered it was amazing, the stalls are beautiful wooden buildings, all lit up. It was so pretty, it was so busy that we couldn't go on the big wheel but we brought tickets for the sky swing and it was fantastic, fabulous view of London. Yes the rides are expensive but well worth the price. We all had a fantastic memorable evening. We arrived on the Oxford tube and found a coach straight away to take us back, what a good service.||December 7, 2014
sheilaw705||10||What did they do to winterwonder land? In past years you could walk easily around the stalls go off to funfair if you wanted ect ect, but this year you are herded in & it's just the funfair so by the time you fight through the crowds to get to the pretty Christmas stalls you've had enough & just want to leave, not a nice experience & very disappointing.||December 7, 2014
dreyajov||30||Queuing system a nightmare; stewards standing around shouting KEEP LEFT into megaphones, people holding up waves of other people by taking selfies, rubbish everywhere, drunken Santa pub crawlers, overpriced rides, "throw the weighted ball and don't hit anything for £4" activities...There were some great rides; mind you, they were between £6-10 a go per person. If you want to go and eat, say, one hotdog each, drink one cup of mulled wine each and go on, say, two rides each, prepare to fork out £60 at least and be there for hours queuing. Went on the observation wheel, which was so filthy you couldn't really take photos through the windows. I get that it's a popular ride, and hard to maintain, but a quick wipe down once a day wouldn't hurt! and queued for 25 mins to get on it despite purchasing a ticket in advance. £6 for a tiny photograph of yourself on the ride? No thanks... or £8 for a titchy keyring...I love funfairs, but this one has gotten too big, too dirty and too expensive. I think most people just ended up trudging around a lot and not really doing anything. If you're loaded, and don't mind queues, manky toilets and a lot of having your feet stepped on... then you'll love it.||December 7, 2014
hoddy_9||30||Came to Hyde park this time to visit winter wonderland. That park is massive and has many areas you can go and see nice gardens ponds lakes etc. The park hold the winter wonderland for a month or so and this is one of the reasons I came. The winter wonderland was busy and I would advise to go on a week day as there are less people. If you go on a weekend it is very busy and hard if you have kids or buggies. It has lots of rides and food halls. Each ride is £6 an adult and £4 per child to you will need a lot of money. In fact looking around I don't think anything was below £2 food drinks or rides. The whole attraction is worth a visit. Just be prepared to spend some money ||December 7, 2014
491rosan||10||Horrendous waste of a trip to Winterwonderland, when we arrived were told it was a two hour wait for admission, massively overcrowded, and poor crowd control from stewards. Gave up and took our two young children home. Not for families....||December 6, 2014
GemmaW1220||10||Over priced, over rated and over crowded. Don't bother going. Instead take a walk down Oxford/ Bond street has much more Christmas spirit!Winter wonderland is not worth the hassle unless of course you love queues, being ripped off and wasting money on games that you will never win!Best thing about the whole experience was the churros- even then I've had better! ||December 6, 2014
BristolSteved||40||Spent a day at Winter Wonderland. Its free entry to the attraction, so you can wander around the many stalls and food/drink stands, you pay (with tokens) for each ride separately or book some in advance online. Whilst rides are expensive, there are many different rides that are not your typical ones you find at the local fairs. 5D cinema at 5 tokens(£5) per person was a rip off, but all the others we did were good. Zippos circus night show was fantastic, Walking around Ice Kingdom ( beware -8 degrees C inside !!) was amazing. Ice skating fun, it was a warmer day so it began to get a little slushy. Good experience for adults and families with children around 7yrs+.||December 6, 2014
teenager65||40||We were having to fill in time after a meal and before getting our return train home. It was suggested we visit Winter Wonderland. I did not even know of it's existence, not even in previous years. We arrived just as it was getting dark to be greeted by the full array of lights, Stalls selling all types of goods, Beer and Food outlets and the Fun Fair.Most impressed and very well organised. Ample well kept toilet facilities which is a bonus. You did not feel crowded and the atmosphere was as you would expect, a lot of people enjoying themselves. WELL WORTH A VISIT if you can.||December 6, 2014
casey0999||40||Enjoyed the hour of skating, but wow was it crowded on the ice! Calmed down after about 1/2 hour though. During the evening they had a young woman singing and playing guitar which was nice.They don't allow photos while inside, which is kind of a rip-off, as it is just to enhance the business of the professional photographers! I suggest a bit of civil disobedience to this rule - take your photos at will...There is no need to queue up beforehand - the whole queue with reservations goes in at once.||December 5, 2014
Musa T||40||it is amazıng palace you have alots choosen I usually prefer walking with my friends if the weather is good you need to just sunglasses :)||December 4, 2014
Heather A||50||In busy London, you sometimes forget how wonder a bit of peace and quiet can be. Walked through the park to Kensington Palace and frankly one of the high points in my trip!! Loved watching the dogs romp and people just sitting.A wonderful contrast to the driven people running to catch a tube!!||December 4, 2014
plmusson||40||Bavarian village in the park and a ginormous fairground stretching forever. Booths selling hot food and good coffee,presents etc.Comparing it to Birmingham German market ,this is better. Spent a long time wandering around .this is well worth a visit.Good for kids and adults.||December 4, 2014
simon v||50||Amazing Park. It's huge, green and calm. Perfect place to read, write or jog. Very well maintained and safe!||December 3, 2014
MrsDetail||50||Lovely, quiet place to walk among gorgeous trees. It's hard to imagine Henry VIII hunting there! The day we visited was windy and chilly, but we loved the park.||December 3, 2014
farzizzz||30||Lots of walking to do and looks exactly the same as when I went years ago... Not much to say really. Winter wonderland on Hyde park is amazing though! ||December 3, 2014
jjpmaia||50||BEST PARK EVERNo, really. The park is huge, and when you stand in the centre you can't ear the city noise. The squirrels are very cute, and the speaker's corner is very interesting!I would recommend it!||December 3, 2014

Tina773||50||We went to Hyde park winter Wonder land. It was just amazing. So many things to see and do. You could spend all day there. There were 150 Christmas stalls selling beautiful things. Lots of rides and plenty of places to get something to eat. Will be going again next year.||December 3, 2014
Alohachick60||50||I didn't really want to go here because although parks are lovely, I had enough walking to do through London. I happened to see the sign for the Winter Wonderland and decided it may be worth the walk. It definitely was! The park was filled with arts and craft as well as food booths, not to mentions lots of fun rides. The prices are a bit high but they always are at this kind of thing. Rides for adults were 5 or 6 pounds, kids 3-4. Unfortunately we could stay just an hour but I would have liked to stay longer, tasting, browsing and riding.||December 3, 2014
onecatshort||50||I absolutely adore Hyde Park. I love it because it is not only a major tourist attraction, but also because it is a park in the center of a city where the locals are living their lives. I could walk around the park all day - and have - just people watching. And dog watching. And bird watching. There are monuments around every corner, statues, delightful nooks and crannies. History too is everywhere you look - Marble Arch and Speaker's corner and Rotten Row. Take a day in the middle of your visit to London, take a picnic lunch, go to the park and just BREATHE.||December 2, 2014
Alaa_AbdulWahab||30||I like the park when i was young but my last visit i feel it was changed not like before, now i only see people just talking in the corner, no body can enjoy like before ||December 1, 2014
dnasmyth01||50||The park is quite beautiful during the holidays and includes an area with rides, ice skating, shops with food and drinks. Love the lights. It really got us into the Christmas spirit during our visit.||December 1, 2014
Reem_Khayat||50||You can spend a full day in the Park playing football with friends, picnic with Family, feed birds.. and we enjoyed the ride in the lake for 20 pounds ..you will see squirls & many kinds of birds. the location of the park is fantastic.. you can go by Walk from Oxford street or if you stay in Gorsvenor house Marriot you will arrive to the park in 10 to 15 minutes. Make sure you wear something comfy because you will walk alot inside the park.||November 30, 2014
stanpbg||50||Hyde park like the rest of London is history, On Sunday the get on their box and talk politics to crowds of people. The city has so many things to do and visit, the first thing you should do is take a tour of London and get to see the city so that you can go back to see the sights and know where you are. There are cities that you can visit this is one of them. Plenty of HISTORY and thing to visit, One thing the country speaks ENGLISH which makes it easier.Go there and enjoy.||November 30, 2014
adamsmadi11||50||My wife and I spent half a day there, starting 9:00 AM, it was rather cold and a little foggy, but it was magic, the winter trees, the fallen orange and red leafs. squirrels that hope right up to you and eat from your hand. the historical statues, it was all a surreal experience. it was very clean and neat.We started off at the Marble Arch and walked all the way across to kensington park.||November 30, 2014
choosevegan||40||There is so much to see as you go through the park. We combined our journey with St. James Park and walked from Kensington Gardens through to Buckingham Palace then on to Big Ben, etc. A must do to really get a sense of London. The live opera and bands we got to hear were a nice bonus.||November 29, 2014
LittleJenny||40||We thought we would give this a look as we were in the area. It is free to go in and has rides for all ages, a big wheel, food and drink stalls and a reasonable size Christmas market. It is well thought out and has a very festive feel to it. The Christmas market stalls were very nice and there were sideshows and a large skating rink. The only downside to the event is the prices of the rides which are a bit prohibitive if you are a family. You need multiple tokens for each ride which are £1 each - there is no discount for buying packs of tokens and no wristbands which cover everything which is a shame as there are lots of really good rides but unless you are willing to pay £5 plus per person per ride you cannot have a go on.||November 29, 2014
Dimi L||50||A beautiful large city park for a very relaxing walk! If the weather is good, it helps a lot... A must!||November 29, 2014
Hessamk||50||The hyde park is a very huge park that has many entrances to it , one side its near the "Royal Garden Hotel" , one side of the park has games , the other side has the area beside the lake , you can either sit at the grass or rent the chairs there per hour. The entrance is free there but the games are not , there are timing when the park opens and close and when you want to visit you need to check the timing. It's a nice play to sit and relax.||November 28, 2014
SrujanNaik||40||Spend some quiet time alone or go for a run. Let your little ones run amok. May be not on the top of your to do list, but if you have some time to spare, do visit this place. Its lovely!||November 28, 2014
tezpil||50||Lovely park with some great statues and monuments, Look at a map of hyde park before visiting to make the most of your stroll or jog through the park. There's plenty of signposts to the various points of interest such as Albert Memorial, Serpentine Gallery, Queen Caroline Temple, Physical Energy Statue and more.||November 26, 2014
pikejo||50||what an incredible oasis in an otherwise very busy hectic environment. Take time to simply walk and relax and realize how long the park has been around. ||November 25, 2014
Shazza1469||50||Plently of room for the kids to run around, love the rose garden too, very well kept. As you walk along you come across some ducks, geese, swans be careful not to stand on the poo, it was a fair bit and made it look dirty also the water looked very dirty too. But saying that would still go back there.||November 25, 2014
Sharon R||30||I liked the festive atmosphere, Christmas fayre and funfair. The downside is how much money it is possible to spend!||November 24, 2014
CorkyC14||50||I got so lost in this gigantic park, and the people walking through have no idea how to help you out...but the park is beautiful and its a good long stroll.||November 24, 2014
Katherine_Ratcliffe||40||Hyde Park Christmas Markets! The biggest markets I have ever seen! Surprising the prices are the same as Manchester and you get more for your money drink wise!There is so much to see and do with the fun fair being there too! You have to have a mulled wine and sausage if you're over that side of town! ||November 24, 2014
Nicola I||50||Second year in a row coming to Winter Wonderland and it hasn't disappointed one bit. The atmosphere is amazing and magical. Another plus free entry also they lay a hard flooring down so muddy mess is minimal.There's something for everyone - dancing, singing, rides, shops, food alcohol, warm drinks etc...||November 24, 2014
Neil S||20||It's true that the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland is spectacular - Market stalls galore, a huge funfair, and fantastic lights and decorations - but don't let the "free entry" fool you...The website says that funfair rides "start at £3" - but actually, almost all of them are £5 or more, with the most expensive being £7. Kids only pay £1 less than adults. Other attractions such as the Magical Ice Kingdom, and the two Circuses, are £10-12 per person.And the food is simply extortionate - a HotDog costs £7.50, and an extra £1 if you want Onions!Even a small portion of chips/fries cost £3.50!I expect to pay a bit more than usual at a special event such as this - but these prices are just beyond a joke.||November 24, 2014
Bigyin93||50||Coming from a small village that could probably fit inside Hyde Park 4 times over, it was a fantastic site. Great walk and plenty of wildlife. Anyone wanting to just escape the fast paced attitude of London this is a great way to have a calm relaxing time.||November 23, 2014
Graham H||50||This is one of London's largest parks, and as it's autumn it includes its "Winter Wonderland". If that's what you want, fine. If you want to enjoy the park itself, don't worry - it's big enough for you to get away from the noise. The options are numerous: you can walk along The Serpentine (a small lake) or along very straight paths, or wander around quite aimlessly. Be warned - you may lose track of exactly where you are! One of the pleasures of wandering when you don't know the park well is not knowing what you may find. Yesterday I came across the Norwegian War Memorial, a simple stone in thanks for the friendship between Norway and the UK in World War 2. Speakers' Corner is at the North East corner of the park and can be interesting or diverting, depending on who's talking. A visit to London would not be complete without a stroll round Hyde Park.||November 23, 2014
zizi s||50||We went for winter wonderland, the park itself is large and spectacular, especially the trees there are 250 different speices, and the autumn colors are amazing, very peaceful. Lots of leaves have fallen from the trees which added to the magic, there are a lot of beautiful fountains, Peter Pan statue, Lady Diana memorial fountan, and the Albert memorial. And winter wonderland have added the glamour for this lovely Royal Park. I will go again in December to see the season changing to this park and winter wanderland will definitely deserve a second visit will strongly recommend.||November 22, 2014
3PW||40||The Winter Wonderland is a super night out. Cirque Beserk is just unbelievable and the Bavarian Village is thoroughly recommended. Good for kids and good for grown ups too...||November 22, 2014
Huyennie||50||I absolutely love Hyde Park! My friend and I walked through Hyde Park every day during our five-day stay during the summer time. Walking along the Serpentine, finding squirrels in trees or bushes, picknicking under the trees... It is just great to be surrounded by nature after a long day in the city.||November 21, 2014
JerseyBeanFamily||30||Got to the park a lot later than expected (about 7pm) on a planned circular route around London so had to walk along the central "West Carriage Drive" road which cuts straight across the middle from Royal Albert Hall and the Albert Memorial (which both looked fantastic floodlit) across to Bayswater - we were able to cut up North Drive to get up to Marble Arch to see the Oxford Street lights.Throughout our walk we could see pretty lights all around - even one tower which my 3 year old decided was a rocket because of all the lights on it. We also were passed by a couple of mounted police officers which he thought was fantastic. I've not given a higher marking as many of the gates were locked so we couldnt go in the Park itself near any of the monuments etc which might have been my misunderstanding of the website opening times but it certainly isn't clear that you cant get to see the Diana fountain etc after dark. We saw a couple of people climbing over a fence but that wasn't something we were going to do ourselves.||November 20, 2014
Christina191282||40||Went here for winterwonderland and it was absolutely magical for my younger brother mainly.The park itself is large and beautiful. I will definitely be returning to the park in December this year once again and I'm sure I will be impressed still! ||November 18, 2014
ET-retired||40||The park was only a shot cab ride from our hotel but it was a nice way to wind down after a hectic day of running around the city just sort of sit back and enjoy the pond and the park.||November 16, 2014
Knutey1111||50||Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens to the West are a great change of pace right in the bustling city of London. During our visit we walked a lot through the parks. The landscaping, even in late September, was in excellent shape. My wife enjoyed feeding the birds, especially the swans, along the Long Water lake. The Princess Diana Memorial was peaceful but a little confusing in design. The Italian gardens at the NW corner were also cool. While we didn't get to see the entire park during our limited time, we did see quite a bit during the two miles of walking we did. There were lots of people using the park for exercise or leisure activities in addition to the tourists. It looks like you could rent bikes and boats too.||November 15, 2014
AssahaHyde||50||we used to make sport every morning at hte park and rent bicycles. the atmosphere is pretty and we can feed the squirel. we enjoyed nature and healthy breathing.it is really an amazing time we spend there.||November 13, 2014
Toydog16r||50||This park is beautiful. Simply put. It's central London but feels like you're miles from anywhere. You can sit and read a book in quiet contemplation or just wander aimlessly. It can take up to a whole day but I limit it because otherwise I'd spend a lifetime there.||November 13, 2014
Massimo M||50||The most pleasant natural spot in London. Squirrels, dogs, strollers, swans, duck and a lot of trees, The best place after a day of compulsive shopping!||November 13, 2014
Yulanspages||50||I loved this park. It's a great place to unwind and then to enjoy the beautiful trees and flowers that surround you. I recommend it everyone who visits London.||November 12, 2014
SarahDelgrosso93||50||When I'm in London, I always enjoy coming to Hyde Park. Pleasant environment and a great place to read my books! Best time to visit is always during the summer. ||November 12, 2014
Robin K||40||I really enjoyed Hyde Park. Only took a short stroll, visited some monuments and snapped a few pictures. Could easily spend a whole day here instead of less than an hour.||November 11, 2014
HollyBerryElf||50||Big, green and room to breathe and run. Wonderful place to spend a few minutes or a few hours relaxing and refreshing yourself while in London. On previous trips, we have taken a picnic and eaten on a bench while watching dogs being walked (or playing with puppy friends), children playing and birds or squirrels. This time we just walked and enjoyed the green. Get away from the edges and you can't hear the traffic. There are ponds and waterways as well as trees, plants and fields to enjoy. Just be aware that it is prohibited to feed the pigeons ... signs are posted near the various entrances to the park.||November 10, 2014
Luv2TvlwU||40||Huge green spaces are so welcome amidst the hustle and bustle of city life. After some heavy-duty sightseeing and battling with crowds, we escaped into Hyde Park. We entered at the Marble Arch, checked out the famous Speaker's Corner, though no one was speaking at the time. We then took a leisurely stroll into the park and along the Serpentine to watch the Swans.The only negative is that they made you pay money to rent a chair in which to sit. Now that's uncivilized!||November 10, 2014
Ivan N||50||A wonderful, huge park, with great walkways, paths, and really relaxing. The speakers corner happens on Sundays, at about 10-11 am. The lady that was explaining it to me was not all that amazed by it. And it's located by one of the entrances, but for the life of me I can't remember which one. But you have like little tourist stops inside the park, so you can check with them.Walk around, enjoy...||November 8, 2014
padreray||40||I visited Hyde Park on a day when it seemed the whole world was coming to London to see poppy displays, football and rugby matches, or the Lord Mayor's Show. After crowded trains, and tube stations Hyde Park was an oasis of calm. Though a late Autumn day with a slight drizzle, the park still gave a space to breath before venturing back into the hustle of the city. In the Rose Garden and Dell sections nature did its thing, and there was even a heron (crane?) in the middle of London. All in all a wonderful experience.||November 8, 2014
RudiD534||50||I have walked around this park on 2 occasions , my advice ...get yourself a meal a coffee & a cigarette sit down somewhere & relax !!! Take a girl there & you will be a happy & good man ||November 8, 2014

455melissat||50||This park is beautiful and relaxing. There are separate pathways for walkers, bikers, and even horses! The paths are wide, and even on the weekend I didn't feel crowded or like I was in anyone's way. If you are looking for free entertainment, the people and animal watching are great. There are also many benches to relax and read a book on if that's your thing, too! Don't miss this beautiful park I'd you are nearby!||November 7, 2014

Chris W||40||Visited during Winter, Was good for a walk through, had a festival on during the time which was interesting but nothing special. Very scenic though and a great walk. Bring a camera and allow yourself a few hours.||November 5, 2014
8asia||40||Until you visit and walk in Hyde Park, you wouldn't think or imagine that there could be such a beautiful serene Park in the heart of London of this massive size. It shows how the City of London has strictly maintain many Parks in London to keep the beauty of the City and if you had limited time visiting London, a walk in Hyde Park has to be a must that you don't want to miss. The Park is very well kept with walking & cycling paths as well as horse riding. there is even the Serpentine Lake for rowing & swimming. There is also a Playground for Kids with sand pits and the usual play things. Great time for the Family to spend a Summer afternoon.||November 4, 2014
IMB2504||40||You need time if you want to walk in the park from one end to another. There is a lovely lake with many swans and there are also plenty of coffee shops in hyde park itself so you don't need to go to starbucks.||November 4, 2014
BennyGhasedi||40||Hyde park is giant park for spending your evening and maybe ride bicycle , does have some great spot but for me wasn't so impressive . Free of charge and a must . don't visit in fall or winter , always have a umbrella with yourself .||November 4, 2014
BethoGiordani||50||This is a stunning park inside the London's city limits.Walk, bike, run, rest, eat a picnic, photograph, discover places, and much more.Beautiful places to know.It's a "must go" city attraction.||November 4, 2014
Fearless803025||40||This was the first stop on my London trip and it was such a beautiful, unique place. There was so much going on with from Speaker's corner to a 'Bulldog meetup'. It is huge and would make a great place for runners. Highly recommended.||November 4, 2014
StefJax||40||London has LOTS of green spaces but Hyde Park is my favorite. It's huge but you can walk through it in about 30 minutes if you are in a hurry but I prefer a slower pace to literally stop and smell the roses. You can rent a deck chair and picnic on a green space or seek out a mini garden full of blooming flowers. There are little stands all around were you can get a drink or a snack. This is a great place for friends, families or couples.||November 3, 2014
Chris S||50||London may be fast and very very busy, but take time out and enjoy the space and peaceful outside world of Hyde Park. Visit Princess Diana's fountain; the Albert memorial; take a rowing boat on the Serpentine. Hire a bicycle and easily ride the full length of the park, riding alongside Rotten Row where horses are often seen trotting along.||November 3, 2014
am08540||50||Hyde Park is centrally located. Speakers corner is a fantastic place to go pass on Sundays. As we live nearby, we walk our dog there everyday. Lots of people strolling, dog walking, and cyclists. Be careful of the cyclists (non-Boris riders). The speed at which some of these guys go is extremely hazardous. Mind your surroundings!||November 2, 2014
TrakDah||40||Not much to say. It is a really nice park. Full of squirrels, ducks, geese and pedal boats to hire and ice cream to eat and...The grass is green and the sun was out, so we didn't have any problems really, but there are way too few benches in the park. And rubbish bins!But do spend a few hours there. It's really worth it. We did it to get geared up for a visit at Harrods which is a 5-10 minute walk from the park.||November 2, 2014
GeoffreyMcGiraffe||50||I set out for an early morning walk before breakfast, staying nearby in Kensington. It was a September morning, grey, a bit foggy. I walked for an hour and, as the sunrise broke through, the beauty of this oasis in the City of London became quite captivating. It is a traditional park in many ways, lots of grassy space, trees, walkways, etc. But, as I wound my way through I found monuments, lakes, gardens. Just moments from the busy, main road is the Italian Gardens and fountains. The river is bountiful with bird life. I only saw the park in the early morning, along with the exercising and dog walking public but it will remain in my memory forever.||November 1, 2014
ElisaRuggieri||50||I love parks and this one is wonderful, especially in the morning hours between 7am and 9am when it's still quiet & peaceful... Sunrise on the Serpentine is magic...||November 1, 2014
Oodnil||40||I dont usually hang around parks but this is a great spot for a nice quite walk and a getaway from the busy London sites.||October 31, 2014
mp8625||40||When the sun comes out everyone seems to descend on the park. Plenty big enough and they also have a fair few people entertaining. ||October 30, 2014
charlottehannah1||50||Hyde Park is gorgeous, feels like a true getaway even though Knightsbridge is less than a 5 minute walk away! Lake Serpentine is absolutely beautiful, we took a rowing boat for ourselves and went on a lovely little journey around the lake. The views of urban skyscrapers and green totally contrast each other and are lovely! Prices for the boats are really reasonable too, so all in all a lovely place - would highly recommend to families and couples, or anyone wanting to escape the craziness of London!||October 30, 2014
Mirinda K||40||We just enjoyed being able to walk through the Park or if you choose to ride a bike they are there for hire as well. The paths are well marked and places to have coffee or a snack if you want to. There are maps and directions all over to show you where you are or where the nearest station, etc are.||October 29, 2014
Tarndy||50||No getting away from the fact that this is a park that has wide open spaces and a boating lake with wildlife that you could find in other places (bear with me....). No getting away from the fact that the eateries rob you blind with their prices. But this is not anywhere - this is London. And to find a wide open space such as this within touching distance of such historical sites in a truly wonderful city is simply amazing. Open to all - enjoyed by all - free of charge - makes you truly proud to be British.||October 29, 2014
Kay L||40||Lots of traffic in walking too and from the park. Lovely with many attractions, but it was drizzling while we walked through, sigh. It's a park!||October 27, 2014
Stan G||40||We walked through this park on our way to the "on and off" bustop. I loved the way the large old trees lined the walk/run/bike way. It looked well kept up. My title says the rest.||October 26, 2014
Denes_the||50||Its amazing park and its free. There is an amazing lake called SERPENTINE, where you can sit and drink a good cup of coffee or just sit and think about life ||October 24, 2014
rizznizz||50||Such a beautiful place. We walked the whole thing in just 1 hour. Get a map so you can see all the monuments and statues placed all over the place. If you have the extra time to check it out then do it.||October 22, 2014
720hassan||50||Amazing and natural park in the middle of crowded London..Breathing fresh air and spend the day time walking between the trees and by the lakes..||October 21, 2014
kes1902||40||This is an amazing place to visit. Historically the people have gone there to lecture the public on generally any and all things. However it is a really wonderful place to visit in the middle of London.||October 21, 2014
LeticiaCFJ||50||The park offers many attractions. Rent a bike for a day at the machines, is easy, and ride. If you are smart, buy a sandwich and some beverages and a good book. Feel local, feed the ducks.||October 20, 2014
deshan_cd||50||Superb!!!. Can spent whole day. One circle walk = 1/2 Singapore :) Love to visit this place again and again.||October 19, 2014
mountainsara||50||I walked through Hyde Park, but not the whole park.I walked along the lake and enjoyed all the different water birds...ducks, swans, geese etc. It was really peaceful and a nice break from the fast paced touring I had been engaged in the previous few days. There was a long tunnel of rose vines to walk under which was pretty and nice statues and things. I kept walking through Kensington gardens which was also nice, but Hyde park was much prettier and better maintained.||October 19, 2014
mmsbd||50||We visited this park during our london trip in September 2013. The park is big and there are is a nice lake at the middle of the park. It is also a nice place for exercise, biking etc. After a hectic day, we passed some quiet and nice time in that place. This place is worth a visit. I would definitely recommend this.||October 19, 2014
Laura S||50||It's nice to find a pocket of nature in the middle of London. There were quite a lot of people though, so don't expect quiet time there. It was pretty cool to see a group of roller bladers pulling some tricks, with music provided.||October 19, 2014
JokkusBokkus||50||A massive park with pleny of option for relaxing n chillaxing. Great place to have a picnic with some alcoholic beverages n maybe a doobie or two. We came here multiple times to relax as its so big that one cane easily change scenery for each time, and its surprisingly tranquil.Best part is that its free, and its water fountains and free toiletts :)||October 19, 2014
BeanyExplorer||40||We passed through after a hectic morning at Portobello Road Market, with minutes the traffic noise died away and it was time to relax! We took our daughter to the Diana Memorial Park which was great. Kids under 10 will love it! Lunch was had at the cafe next door, there is no seating inside, but despite it being October it was a pleasant day to spend having lunch in the open. Hyde Park is vast and with the autumnal colours starting to show though we came away saying we will be back!||October 18, 2014
Ibadanboy||50||Hyde Park is a lovely park right in the middle of London. Beautiful grounds, trails for walking, cycling, a lake/ river and lovely lovely scenery. Most definitely worth a visit during your London trip.||October 18, 2014
rf882||50||It is everything you would expect from a large urban park, lakes, English gardens, fountains, monuments and open space for all. It is a great way to relax and get away from the hustle bustle of the city.||October 18, 2014
cocacola499||50||Take the time and to to the park...do not forget to bring with you crackers, bread or green stuff...like apples, grass and anything that you think that the ducks, pigeons and the swans will want to eat...they are very friendly and if you do not move to fast they will come eat out of your hands.The park it;s big...they have special alleys were you can only walk and others were you can only cycling...it's a breath of fresh air from the polluted city.||October 14, 2014
alwysluv2travel||50||Take an hour or stay all day, this is a magnificent park in central London. There is so much to see and it doesn't cost a thing. We did hire bikes and rode the bicycle lanes and got off and walked when we wanted to see more like the lakes where you couldn't actually ride. You can sit on the grass and enjoy the scenery for free as it changes all the time. Londoners really take advantage of their parks and what they offer and tourists too can enjoy them.||October 14, 2014
Natalie1964||40||If you live in London or are visiting London like I was, this is a must go to. You can walk for hours. Serpentine lake is lovely and you can get out on the water in a paddleboat. There is a Princess Diana waterfall which is flat that the kids can splash in and would keep them amused for ages. Statues of the grandest nature near The Royal Albert Hall entrance. Beautiful open space in the middle of the hustle and bustle of London.||October 14, 2014
Thomas J||40||Over the last two trips to London, we have had occasion to visit Hyde Park to experience The Last Night of the Proms, which has been fantastic experiences! The park is also just as natural a place of rest and serenity as well as Central Park is important in the same way in New York! Whatever you do - throw any old hard bread at the ducks in the pond just ... :)||October 14, 2014
Myromy||50||We ran every morning in Hyde Park and had a different experience each time! We stopped and watched the cannons being set off by the military guards, the royal horses being exercised thru the park, children's jumping lessons on their ponies, a luncheon being set-up close to Kensington gardens, what we thought was Princess Anne being transported toward Kensington Palace. Never a dull moment for our daily exercise!||October 14, 2014
maureen592014||40||Gardens are beautiful and statues. Was a lovely day. Saw a lot of people with dogs. Seems to be a very dog friendly park.||October 14, 2014
Fm2008||50||Maybe it is my favorite spot in London. Its a huge park in the city, but is kind of cozy, not so big. There is a pond where you can spend hours just admiring the view.||October 12, 2014
NumNumNads||50||This is my favourite park in the world, so much to do and see. You could easily spend the whole day here. You could hire a pedalo and bob around the lake talking to the ducks. Walk around the park people watching, hire a bike or pull on your skates or have a nosey at speakers corner, a old London tradition. You could also take the little ones to the Diana memorial park or the small outdoor pool. There are lots of places to get a good quality bite to eat. You could also order a luxury picnic from the hotel's that are near the park for example: The Mandarin Oriental or The Park Tower.||October 12, 2014
Francisco P||50||Talk a walk around the park and it was spectacular. Ton's of people out for exercise, sightseeing, or just sitting around on the grass having a chat. Beautiful place, disappointed by the disrespect some people have for it since around some of the benches there were piles of trash with bottles of soft drinks and alcohol. Truly spectacular place though.||October 11, 2014
zerwickrenatevictor||40||Hyde Park is breathtaking with manicured gardens.Do not miss Speaker's Corner - it can be highly entertaining!Feed the ducks, take romantic strolls, have a picnic and relax in this oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the city.We will be back at this lovely oasis on our next visit to London!||October 9, 2014
mrandmrsbeas||40||A beautiful park to spend time in. You can feed the ducks, stroll by Serpentine Lake or hire a boat, visit the Princess Di memorials or have a nice cream. Recommended||October 7, 2014
WildRoseAB||40||Lovely park and gardens for a relaxing stroll ... After a busy day of sightseeing ... Perhaps have an ice cream, walk around Serpentine Lake, or catch the sunset ... People watch and take in the ambience.||October 7, 2014
Kurple||40||A beautiful sunny, bright October day. A pleasure to sit and people watch while we enjoyed some desert and a bottle of water. A great way to lose some time!||October 6, 2014
CaitlinShawBarry||50||We loved wandering through the Christmas market and seeing all of the vendors. It was magical all lit up at night! ||October 5, 2014
sallybowl||30||Gorgeous place for a picnic and feeding the ducks with the family. I went with my 23month old, only negative I wish there was some sort of play equipment for young children to enjoy in an areaOtherwise on the stunning day we were there we certainly loved a stroll through the well maintained area ||October 5, 2014
760alif||40||Had a stroll around the park on my birthday evening and it was lovely. Pretty walks, and relaxing for the evening. Only let down were some drunken idiots making a lot of noise, but it was not enough to spoil it for me :)||October 4, 2014
Cassiel_Agrippa||50||Hyde Park is essential to London. As are all parks in any big city. After dwelling in the urbans, you need some green surroundings. And squirrels. Lots of them. Going nuts over nuts.The park is very well kept, with an impressive variety of plants, trees and greenery. I don't know how many gardeners are employed to uphold the high level found in Hyde Park, but it shows. The British do know how to keep their gardens and parks.Hyde Park is huge and it will take 20 minutes to cross lengthwise. It actually consists of several parks (much like Central Park in that other big city). Such as the Italian Garden, with its’ lovely sculptures and fountains. And Kensington Gardens, right next to Kensington Palace – lovely English gardening. To the Princess Diana Memorial Playground, which is where you have to take your kids – they will love it. And you for taking them there.Hyde Park is probably the best place to go running. For once I did not try this myself, but there were plenty of others who seemed quite happy about running around in there.Throughout the park are several kiosks where you can get things to eat and drink. And remember to be nice to the animals, and other people. And dispose of your garbage in a proper way.Hyde Park, I love you.||October 4, 2014
luvaholidayScotland||50||On entering the park early on a Sunday morning the Household Cavalry were just leaving, what an amazing sight! Enjoyed a leisurely walk around the park concluding with long seat overlooking the Serpentine on a sunny Sunday, ahh!||October 3, 2014
Mohd S||40||Near to my hotel..the Central Park Hotel,by the we arrived there is no snow,the next day all of the park is covered in the snow.super duper beautiful...wish could be there again when in the snow time||October 2, 2014
CaFrancophile||50||Easy cycling, good restaurant alternatives, pleasant to sit in lawn chairs (just remember,someone will come around and want to be paid for your relaxing.) Pleasant walks, see Kensington Palace at the west end of the park and Embassy Row just beyond the palace.||October 2, 2014
Citallwic||40||Being pressed for time, our tour group did not visit the Speakers Corner of the park. That’s an awful shame, because I was really looking forward to seeing that place and that phenomenon. We could see that a small crowd was gathered there, so something must have been going on. I guess I’ll have to put this one on my return visit list.||October 2, 2014
Flicks||50||London is so lucky to have such an amazing park in the heart of its City.Fabulous to have the bike hire within the Park too, although there were none available on the day we went in. So we walked around.Looked at the swans and ducks on Serpentine Lake.Lots of people just walking, sitting about chatting, having a picnic.It was a great afternoon and perfect place to while away some time.Very relaxing.||October 2, 2014
Klr075||50||Hyde park ran right in front of our hotel and we took a couple of walks through it. Loved the park. It was relaxed and pretty and the gardens and ponds were very beautiful||October 1, 2014
Pandamedic||40||This is a lovely park to go and have a walk in, take a picnic or a book and go and relax on the grass in the sun. There's lots of people there just chilling out and relaxing and generally enjoying themselves. There are several places where you can go get food and drink.||October 1, 2014
Charon54||50||Walked into the park and there were acres of grass, area for horseback riding, canoeing, paddle boating, has its own police station. Green space in the heart of London!||October 1, 2014
Lars I||50||It was very nice and sunny day and we went to the Hyde park, so many people jogging, sitting on the grass and chilling, it was really nice to share this experience!||October 1, 2014
JWal5||50||Beautiful Park in the middle of London, relax and stroll or join in many things happening in the park.||October 1, 2014
antiquesfreak||50||Be sure to visit this beautiful green heaven in the middle of this urban city. Go to the South/east end of the park next to the Serpentine lake, and the boathouse, and skip the "boring" north side. Be sure to bring bread to feed the ducks. They would literally eat out of the palm of your hands.||September 29, 2014
827martinob||50||Always loads going on here lovely place to take the family round the serpintine where you can hire pedalo's well kept and another must visit.||September 28, 2014
DouglasPerthwa||40||Great cafe by the lake. Had an excellent breakfast on a beautiful September morning. Great for walking or jogging. ||September 28, 2014
cricketguru||40||A lovely park in a vibrant city. Lots to see and enjoy, really enjoyed seeing kids of all nationalities playing in and around the Diana Memorial Fountain on a late summer's day. I'm no Royalist but I think she would have approved. Sorry to hear that some other visitors have had bad experiences but they can happen anywhere - however, the relevant authorities should note the concerns and act. No one should feel unsafe or threatened in an English park at any time of day.||September 28, 2014
BurArTu||50||Lovely, peaceful place in the middle of the city center. Nice place to spend some time, lying on the grass, taking a walk, resting your head...||September 25, 2014
Fran J||50||The park is so clean, we didn't see any litter, trees and plants are wonderful. Wildlife is amazing and so tame. Could easily spend all day there in nice weather and it's free, what more could you ask for.||September 25, 2014
Alan D||50||This is our favourite place to walk and enjoy the fresh air. Central for nice shops, walk to Buckingham Palace but have a lovely bite and coffee at the coffee shop at Kensington end of the Lake - reasonable prices. See the Princess Diana water feature, not as spectacular as expected but soak up the atmosphere. Hyde Park is lovely for walking time and also you can see the Royal Albert Hall and memorial well worth the time if you can.||September 24, 2014
badmintontim||40||This Royal Park is used for many concerts and events nowadays.The Winter wonderland is a great event held each year and yes some people state that it is expensive - but it is FREE to go in - so you only pay for what you want to pay for. Speakers corner shows that Britain and especially London is still a free country.Many concerts are held here which are attended by a variety of people.And again it is a great park itself used to its full potential.||September 24, 2014
8ashleighs||50||Loved visiting Hyde Park! The landscape is very pretty, it reminded me of a less manicured Central Park. The only complaint was that along the water, there were a ton of birds! As a result, the sidewalk wasn't very clean. ||September 23, 2014
bigjimlon||50||London is the greenest city of its size in the World, 173 square kilometres of green space which is nearly 40% of it's area! This park is just one of many fine examples of of Green areas, it's a must see on a visit to the city and literally blows other famous world city parks clean out the water!||September 22, 2014
Geoffreypazz||40||This is truly a wonderfully park and the festival was fatalistic there is so much to see from the the Diana fountain the serpentine with boats to hire public swimming speakers counter down load the map at hyde park web site so much to do close to Kensington park and shops take a picnic and enjoy||September 22, 2014
rovingrabbid||30||Hyde Park which is as central as it gets as far as London is concerned is one of the most well maintained and visited parks in the city - if not the entire country.The closest tube station are Hyde Park and Knightsbridge - both on the Piccadilly line. The park is massive and very beautiful - its a favourite haunt for a number of fitness freaks, nature lovers and the likes. There is a big lake in the middle of the park - called the serpentine and next to it is a rather nice cafe as well. On the serpentine you can feed the ducks or just sit down and relax.There are also some concerts which happen here from time to time - but the locals continue to resist any such events as it means noise pollution and what not for them.During the Xmas/New Year season also pitching tent here are the Winter Wonderland people - which in itself is quite nice experience for the kids - with the circus and the ice ring - and the hoards of other rides and eating stalls that get put up.I would suggest taking a walk in the park on a sunny day or just sit for some time - while you decide where next to head to - also very close is Harrods if you fancied some shopping :-)||September 22, 2014
Natali s||50||I love this park! It is so lovely and there are always events and things going on, and even if not, its nice to just go out for a walk. A lot of it is not available for cyclists so be aware!||September 22, 2014
Sean8red||50||What a fantastic place. Loved the park right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of London. Lot of people enjoying themselves. ||September 21, 2014
Hotdog_1958||50||Visited recently, and always a pleasure. This is a bit of the countryside in the centre of a very busy bustling city centre. A fabulous venue for music concerts and really enjoyed the weekend of proms in the park and also boasts some amazing sculptures. Make sure you have a drink and eat at the Lido next to the Serpentine. ||September 21, 2014
denis s||40||this was the most amazing experience something for all tastes and age groups I go every year but this year's event was better than ever  even the queues to get in were well organised and the rain held off toothe only down side was the toilets there was a team of about 3 ladies who were constantly cleaning them but they were awful as usual .I think , considering the huge crowd involved, far more toilets were required.||September 20, 2014
HelenaGuerra||50||If you need respite from the hot summer or just want to take a look at a nice urban garden, come here. This is one of the best parks in London and you can see Londonites doing their thing at lunch time or in the morning rush. Start in Marble Arch or Wellington Arch and walk west.||September 20, 2014
chestervoyager||50||Hyde Park is a huge and majestic park in the heart of London - plenty of space to escape the hustle and bustle of the capital city. Ideal for walking, jogging, taking your dog for a walk, a meeting with friends, a group picnic or just lying down in the sun.It's also the venue for some big music events and the most recent was the BBC Radio 2 festival concert. We were lucky enough to be among the 50,000 or so crowd and experience some fantastic performances. Gregory Porter, Kacey Musgraves, Chrissie Hynde, Billy Ocean and Bellowhead all very good. Blondie had dynamite energy and the Jeff Lynne's ELO set was absolutely fantastic. I'm still hearing the songs in my head one week on.If you are planning to go to a future one, I'd recommend arriving early as the organisers still can't seem to get people in very efficiently - we arrived around 11.15am and only just got through the entrance at 1pm (the start of the show). But don't wait for a big event to visit - this is a park of which many international cities would be jealous.||September 20, 2014
Chris I||50||Along with 50,000 other lucky ticket holders, went to the BBC Radio 2 Festival in a day in Hyde Park. Saw Billy Ocean, Blondie, Paloma Faith, Gregory Porter, Bellowhead, Kacey Musgraves, Chrissie Hynde, but best of all Jeff Lynnes ELO. Absolutely blew everyone away fantastic a day i'll never forget||September 19, 2014
Alixandre T||50||Very calm , huge and relax area in London.Its perfect to chilling , have a lunch or just meet friends.Dont forget to feed the squirrels, ducks and take an ice cream there.||September 18, 2014
HansamCotswolds_UK||40||The bands were excellent, particularly ELO. Nice crowd and the sound quality was amazing. My only gripe would be that the ticket information said that no chairs would be allowed in the venue. We complied, but were fed up to find 70% of the crowd sitting in their camping chairs. We would have certainly liked to have had a chair as you are there for 9-10 hours. Other than that, a very good day out.||September 17, 2014
TravelingToRun||40||London is a beautiful place to visit and it is similar to Budapest but on a much bigger scale... if you have visited both then you will understand what I mean by this. Hyde park is a must see. At Christmas time the park is host to winter wonderland which is a beautiful magical spectacle that all will enjoy!!Another must visit is speakers corner,,, it is obvious that many speakers here are regulars, but anyone can talk and there are many people who listen! What is also nice is taking a boris bike and cycling or jogging around the parkI hope my review helps you with your visit to this beautiful park.||September 17, 2014
fox555||30||Hyde Park is big that's for sure. But size isn't everything as in my mind Paris' Luxembourg Gardens is way,way ahead in every way from this place. Hyde Park has no intimacy..just loads of grass and great big paths, yes it has ducks and you see stupid people feeding squirrels and there is a strange cafe/restaurant where in true British tradition you queue holding a chipped plastic tray to get a cup of tea and a slice of cake,etc,etc and then wander outside trying to find a table that hasn't got a load of dirty plates on it and/or pigeon or bird droppings. If you order hot food I guarantee it will be cold by the time you have found a table and a chair to sit on.Why oh why cant Britain abandon this stupid self service custom? If you want to kick a football about or play some sort of team game then the park comes in useful.But its not for the romantic. Get the Eurostar and go to Paris and walk around the Luxembourg Gardens and you will see what I mean!||September 17, 2014
Patricia L||40||Whole day was excellent weather perfect & the Bands Top! ELO has a new fan - sound quality was amazing||September 16, 2014
Chrismogs||40||fantastic day for whole family. ELO were class though food and drink was a little expensive. would go again tho||September 16, 2014
judyjudygirl||50||This year I spent more time in the park than in previous years so nice to see that they're keeping it up better than ever they have signs on a lot of the trees identifying the plants the flower walk is lovely even though I went in late summer it was still a lovely relaxing place to go and now that they have added the bikes it's fantastic you can get from one end to the other in no time and there a separate path for the pedestrians and bikers so just a lovely place to be in the city or you can enjoy a lovely day without spending any money at all!||September 16, 2014
Watts45||50||Loved watching ELO in concert and would go to more concerts in Hyde park Didn't like the queue we were ||September 16, 2014
Maxstudio||50||Very different from other royal parks. Hyde park is very large, looks more natural, and is perfect for strolling and bird watching.||September 15, 2014
SuperTed19||50||We visited in December, but the park maintains its beauty even without blooming flowers. We hope to return someday to see it in full bloom.||September 15, 2014
EsmeraldaRosenknopp||50||Big and very nice, so beautiful on a sunny day. You must go there, very nice walk, lot to see, lot o f birds.||September 14, 2014
CDM49||50||Having left our hotel one morning we walked along Kensington Gardens and the length of Hyde park a distance of about 1.5 miles. Walking along the edge of the park we saw runners, walkers, birds, swans, and people just relaxing on the grass. It's a lovely park well maintained and used by many Londoners/tourist.||September 13, 2014
Mommabev||50||Great for strolling, horseback riding, people watching. Also a good shortcut to get from one side of the town to the other. Nice open air restaurant near the middle of the park.||September 13, 2014
BedoAli||50||Large, quiet. clean , secure, fantastic lake , free beach seats to relax in the the sunny weather, I have realy enjoyed this place, kids entertainment, bicycling, ships and water activities.||September 13, 2014
ladybugsSydney||50||Hyde Park is a really lovely space to wander around, and in spring, when we visited, it was very pretty.||September 13, 2014
Craig H||50||Hyde park offers a break from the crush of the city. I was truly surprised at how well maintained the park is from the rose garden to the paths. ||September 12, 2014
dianeuk111||50||We visited on a lovely late summer Sunday and did a bit of people watching, had an ice cream, fed the swans and (huge!) ducks, watched the pedaloe's and the runners (doing a 10k run for charity). What more could one ask for! Great place for all ages and something for each to enjoy. Will be back again.||September 12, 2014
Aidski||50||A great bit of greenspace. Between this, Regent Park, Kensington Gardens, St. James Park, Green Park and countless others, Central Londoners have an enviable number of options to duck out of hectic urban life for awhile. ||September 11, 2014
Sam K||50||It's about 4 miles total around the park and a good place if you want a gentle jog or just a nice pleasant stroll, we decided to skate around it! ||September 9, 2014
Judy U||50||Lovely place to stroll, sun, picnic, paddle-boat, or just sit and enjoy the ambiance. It's a nice break from the hustle & bustle of London, and right in the middle of the city. Kind of like Central Park in New York City.||September 9, 2014
Marcia M||50||If you love to run, this is the park for you. It is 4 miles around the park and you can run inside on the trails or outside on the sidewalk (not advised if it's during the busy hours). I used to always run the perimeter of Hyde Park and then cross under the Arch and run around St. James Park down to Parliament and along the Thames Path. It's perfect if you're in London and training for a marathon or other long race and need to get some serious miles in in the city. If running isn't your thing, rent a Boris bike and ride around the park. It is especially beautiful and empty at night (obviously this might not be the best if you're alone but I used to run the park at night all the time without any problems and I'm a young female). The Serpentine is pretty and there are some places you can rent boats and get food and use the washrooms.||September 7, 2014

scarlett_106||30||To be fair, I didn't delve much into the park itself; my hotel is right off Lancaster Gate, so I just popped in there and hugged the road until I got to Notting Hill, where I took the tube back (my feet were aching after a long day of sightseeing).It's a nice park, and I didn't see any of the real sights like the palace, gardens, or Serpentine. But the Italian Gardens (right outside Lancaster gate) are lovely and a nice place to sit. There were tons of joggers and also quite a few cyclists.One thing that was different--I barely heard English spoken the entire time I was in the park. Mostly, I heard Arabic. Apparently, Bayswater (the area right north of the park, to the right of Notting Hill I think) has a high Arab population. I saw many women in hijabs (head-covering) and even a few in burkas (full-body and face covering with a slit for the eyes). Nothing wrong with that of course, just found it strange that I heard more Arabic (and Italian, german, etc. from tourists) than I did English. I admit I felt I "stuck out" a bit as a blonde American woman, but it was probably more in my head than anything else.However, I went around 5:30 and I definitely felt safe walking around. Plenty of people around as long as you stick to the main paths (I think any city park can get shady fast if you're a solo woman and venture off where there aren't many people). I wouldn't go out of your way for this park (based on my brief experience and what other reviewers have said) but it's nice for a quick stroll if you're in the area.||September 6, 2014
Ann S||40||You dont get bored there even if you visit every day for a year. There is always something new to discover. Great for so many activities. The gem of London||September 6, 2014
Ken M||50||We visited Hyde Park the day after arriving in London. Fine sunny day and we were able to ride in the paddle boats as we did when we were kids. This place is magnificent.||September 3, 2014
norex2||30||I liked it, unfortunately it was not much more than just a park. Sure, you can walk past the Kensington palace and the big lake, but other than that you won't come across more than squirrels, grass and trees. My point - not a lot is happening throughout the park in my opinion. If you come there for a rest in the afternoon or to eat a snack it's perfectly fine.||September 3, 2014
Loves2TravelALOT_11||40||We stayed at a hotel nearby so this was a very convenient place to stroll and enjoy the beauty of a vast park. The park has a riding stable for those who want to trot around the park. It also has bicycle rentals for those who choose to bike around. At the far end of the park is the Memorial to Princess Diana. It is lovely and an easy way across from Kensington to Marble Arch. ||September 3, 2014
venelink2014||50||Very nice and quiet place in the middle of London. It's perfect for a rest from the long walks. You can plan half a day for a walk in this beautiful park, you won't regret!||September 3, 2014
20Andreas12||40||A huge park that you will not believe that is located in the central of London.The Grand Entrance of the park, known as Queen Elizabeth Gate is impressive. You can enter park and have a nice/peaceful walk, relax and enjoy your day especially if you have kids.Park is contiguous with Kensington gardens. Except Kensington gardens there are some other things you need to see within park (Princess Diana Fountain, Prince Albert Memorial, Peter Pan statue).||September 3, 2014
jenny g||50||We walked from the top of park Lane across the park. It is beautifully kept and hard to believe that it is in the middle of London||September 2, 2014
Heather M||50||We hired bikes and rode around the park. It's just too hard to believe that you are in central London! The flowers were just beginning to bloom and people were enjoying some sun. It was just beautiful and you could spend the whole day there easily!||September 1, 2014
nradford||50||This park just goes on and on. There are beautiful gardens, trails, play grounds, sculptures and fountains, and so much to just see and wander through. It is a gem in the city and so glad we had the opportunity to use it for a little escape on our hectic days in the city.||September 1, 2014
Jon N||50||you could walk for hours here, plenty to see and do. I imagine with better weather, itll be better still||September 1, 2014
Sumeet V||50||Spent the Sunday here. Kids were most fascinated to see Speakers corner and understand what is the meaning for Freedom of Speech. We went to to the paddle boats. We rented them for 30 mins and just spent the day lazing it the park. It was beautiful||September 1, 2014
Sanny B||50||A place where concerts are held...genuinly great green spaces surrounded by a lake with swans, ducks and other birds....clearly marked routes and free toilet facilities on premises.||August 31, 2014
Beanz22||10||My husband and I missed Hyde Park on our first trip to London so we made sure to get there this time even though it was late in the day on Friday (about 7pm). It was still light out so we made our way in. Of course, the park is beautiful and I'm sure during an average daytime it's wonderful, but at 7pm this past Friday it looked like a Muslim nation. Given the general tension in the world (against the US), and the fact that I am a Western woman and the park was literally 99% Muslim (ALL the women were wearing burkas), I was extremely uncomfortable. I don't know if this is an evening thing, a Friday thing, or a one-time thing, but it was very unique and I would not recommend it. I did not look around much, but my husband noted many looks of disgust directed our way. A real shame.||August 30, 2014
TomGagnon||40||There are a number of places or visit within the park. The Princess Diana Fountain is a popular attraction in the summer. The Prince Albert Memorial, Kensington Gardens, and Peter Pan statue are on the west end of the park. Speakers Corner is on the east end. There are wide open spaces and plenty of paths for walking and cycling.||August 30, 2014
BETTY1972||50||One of the many beauty oasis in the heart of London, Hyde Park will remain inextricably linked to Lady Diana, Princess of our hearts.With a blend of beauty, earthly and unearthly while Hyde Park invites you to visit leisurely admire its splendor, starting at Marble Arch and Wellington Arch reaching visiting Albert Memorial, The Serpentine, Lady Diana Memorial Fountain ...And, once here, wash your hands in the crystal clear water, wet your forehead and think for a moment that it was Lady Diana.||August 30, 2014
Rik T||50||Hyde Park looked like an excellent place to sit back on a wooden chair and gaze at the lake, trees and birds. There are a ton of trails and some free loos, ice cream trucks and places to eat.My experience, however, was quite different from that.I signed up for the Serpentine 5k run and it was a pretty good time. The website is http://www.serpentine.org.uk and the officials and marshals were friendly, efficient and kind. The run took us through lots of paths but mostly around Serpentine Lake, which was beautiful with its bridges and trees lining paths around it. The run is unfortunately completely on paved paths. We left a bag with our camera in it inside the fenced area around the bandstand and nothing was stolen. This was a good run other than the paved path and I'm sure you could easily spend an afternoon here. Not necessarily running. Lazing about would be nice.The Hyde Park Corner underground station is a great starting point for the park.||August 29, 2014
social-butterfles||30||A little disappointing for a first visit which i hope in the future to try again despite finding the whole place a little uninteresting, very difficult to walk through and very badly signposted.A few more maps here and there would be preferable.It would also be great if cyclists would ride in the correct area's so pedestrians could walk in safety without the need to jump out of the way constantly||August 27, 2014
Philip S||40||Hyde park is some 350 acres and joins onto Kensington Gardens, which is a mere 275 acres. The combined park of some 625 acres is served by 5 tube stations, but the park can be walked from most parts of central London. Because of its size and location it tends to be more peaceful than Green or St James parks, although it has become very popular with cyclists who speed along the cycle paths.As well as cycling you will see walkers, horse riders skateboarders and joggers, whilst there is also boating available along with plenty of food and drink.||August 27, 2014
166jasperb||40||This is a great park to walk around especially in Summer. It has large and a variety of landscapes. Always a favourite for a lunch break walk.||August 27, 2014
paraman97||50||Im not a park person, parks are for walking your dog if im in london get me in the cityHOWEVERwe had a spare few hours to kill so took a walk to Hyde park and we were glad we did....it did help that it was sunny and so the park was beautiful....very bust but plenty of places to walk around and sitAll in all an enjoyable time||August 27, 2014
suzy814||40||This is a good place if you want to just relax and hangout. There are chairs for people to just sit in on the grass. It's just a park, similar to Central Park, but smaller. It has beautiful gardens and a nice lake. The food is expensive in this area, so I wouldn't eat there.||August 27, 2014
gfsc5||50||Want some peace during hour London visit? Try Hyde Park. Some areas are busy but there are some nice secluded areas that are lovely for strolling through. You might spot a great squirrel or just net time admiring the many trees around the park. Take time to visit the lovely Serpentine waterway and watch the boats. Or visit one of the eating venues available, or visit the small garden areas. Best on a sunny day but worth a visit on any day.||August 26, 2014
DearChicago||50||My top recommendation for something to do in London - grab a Boris bike and cycle round Hyde Park. The park is so big that it's a great way of seeing it all and there is a sheer unbridled joy in pedalling round this iconic park on two wheels. ||August 25, 2014
ALRHA||30||Walking around London it's nice to walk into the park for a change of scenery. On Sunday's you can visit speaker's corner by Marble Arch, and on other days you can take out a paddle boat in the lake. Otherwise you can just walk around on have a picnic in the grass.||August 25, 2014
Bella_Canada_12||30||My family & I enjoyed walking & biking at Hyde Park. It's not as nice as Central Park in New York or Stanley Park in Vancouver, BC but it was convenient to visit numerous times as our hotel was close by. Worth a visit although we thought Greenwich Park was much prettier.||August 23, 2014
BobxxxxCindy||50||Hyde park and Adjacent St James park have "don't feed the animals" signs. Based on the birds and squirrels friendly nature and the size of the squirrels, not many people follow the "rule".The squirrels and some of the birds will eat out of your hand so if you have young kids they will get a treat seeing them up close and personal. Normally such a rule is to protect the animals from predators or forgetting how to forage, but I don't think passing out a few nuts has any effect. Flowers depending on the weather are beautiful, Just not so over the top as the formal gardens in the countryside. Nice change from walking through the city.||August 23, 2014
Peng G||50||walking in hyde park is quite enjoyable and feels very good, no matter you go with families, friends or lover! this is a must go place in London, no doubt !||August 22, 2014
Aisha A||50||I love the garden in general. One of important places in London is definitely the Hyde Park. It not only garden but it is beautiful place for walk and even for visiting and e enjoying the sun and flowers. Also you can see the very beautiful animalsI love it Don't miss it||August 22, 2014
LotusEye||50||The pretty little Primrose Hill Park, the elegant Regent's Park, the beautiful St. James Park, the magnificent Kew Gardens are all wonderful and "a must see" in your London visit. However, Hyde Park is different - grand, beautiful, leisurely, stately, lovely, and one of a kind that you surly must not miss in your London visit. If you can, visit all of the Royal Parks but if you can't then the Hyde Park kind of sums it all. Though a bit overpriced, the cafe on the lake is wonderful and to dine or munch and drink by the Serpentine Lake mid-day or in the early evening is a pleasure beyond description.If you have the luxury of time, visit it a multiple times at different times of a day and I bet you will discover your magical moments at least once at some point!||August 21, 2014
jpjFredrikstad||50||It's like NYC central park but not that big. It' like a green lung in the middle of the city's huzzle and buzzle. You can hire a chair, walk, hire a boat at the lake, eat your lunch and just relax.||August 20, 2014
SALEISSA||50||huge relaxing park in the middle of a busy city! there are lots of similar parks all over the world, but something so special in this one that makes people love it.... i did too... not sure why!!||August 20, 2014
James G||40||If you're staying near Hyde Park try taking a run around the Serpentine, I reckon it was about 2-3 miles and plenty to look at one the way around.||August 20, 2014
Geilstyle||50||This is a beautiful park and a great place to act as a centre base to use to see a few different places around central London. From Marble Arch you could walk along Park Lane side of the park down to Hyde Park Corner. And on down to Knightsbridge, and diagonally across towards Kensignton Palace & Notting Hill. There is a lovely lake in the middle of the park and it's quite a pleasant way to spend a sunny afternoon in London.||August 20, 2014
TravelbumIN||30||Not much going on in this park .. some wild animals , kids will enjoy , if you do not have time you can skip||August 19, 2014
Rebecca S||50||We hired out Barclays bikes, and cruised around the park, which was absolutely lovely. It is quite big, so may take a while if you want to walk around it. Biking allows you to see a lot of the park, in a small amount of time. Plenty to see, gardens, trees, wild grass areas. Paddle in the Diana memorial fountain, or take a boat out on the lake, or find a lovely tree to sit under and relax, maybe even spot a squirrel.||August 19, 2014
Maliyz||50||Hyde Park is probably the most famous of London's many green spaces and deservedly so. It's a large area, that offers space for outdoor sport, eating opportunities, and even a leg of the Serpentine to rent a paddle boat on. You can easily spend a few hours relaxing there and renting a lawn chair to people watch or simply take a little nap when city life gets to be too much.||August 19, 2014
Simdog35||40||Went to Hyde Park in December and was a lot to see and do. The artwork down the side of the park on the weekend was amazing. Speakers corner was interesting, took advice that the best time to go was on Sunday around lunch time. There was heaps of squirrel's and birds and plenty of open space to walk round. Went to the winter wonderland at night.||August 18, 2014
JuanCitoCruz24||40||What I love from HydePark is the wild animals there.. all of them are very friendly.. you can feed them and interact with them!..||August 18, 2014
Menlo_Mom||20||I always compare London to New York, and love them both, but Hyde Park is so dull compared to Central Park. Hyde Park is flat and, while a quiet spot in a busy city, it doesn't have any of the charm of NYC.||August 17, 2014
sbspeedo1||40||Love Hyde Park. So big and so much to explore. You can see all the tourist sights if you want to. Or explore the far flung corners to escape the hordes and feel like you could be any where in the country side!Bring your lunch and have a picnic!||August 17, 2014
Wesnile||20||Not much going on in this park. Some paths to walk and run, a few lakes but that's it. Really pretty weak coming from NY and Central Park.||August 17, 2014
1984jessm||40||Hyde park is a beautiful green space that London is lucky to have. I've been on numerous occasions and still don't think I've seen it all. Some of London's biggest open air concerts have been hosted here and the most recent one I went to was Black Sabbath. I also went to the FREE event they put on during the Olympics. The organisation is impeccable! It's a beautiful park to go to, with easy access from a number of different tube stations.||August 15, 2014
Jofoolayadviser||50||Beautiful in any season, with great snacks such as hot dogs. Walking around the serpentine or just around really is a delight. Kids loved it so much with the paddle boats and such.||August 15, 2014
686TinaJ||50||This park is just the most fantastisk place. Just in the middel off the City. A Grate place to take a brake from the Big City. Take your walking/running shooes on, and enjoy the park. Its just soo Nice. Have just book a new trip to London, and one of my no.1 things to see, is this place. Specialt in the early morning.||August 14, 2014
Heather B||40||Whilst we enjoyed walking alongside the Serpentine and watching the squirrels in the park, we also enjoyed our visit to Apsley House which is situated at Hyde Park Corner and is a property owned and managed by English Heritage. It is open to both members and non-members and is well worth a visit whilst in London. Owned by the 1st Duke of Wellington and all his decendants, it show cases memorabilia of his military career, including his most famous victory when he defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo! It's a lovely house with beautiful portraits of his family and worth spending an hour or two taking in the beautiful rooms which are furnished and decorated as they were in his time and to his taste featuring lots of red and gold.||August 14, 2014
tn62wilts||50||Great walk all round, taking in the Diana memorial, serpentine, Kensington Palace, not enough places to buy drinks etc in the height of summer.Kids loved it so we are happy||August 14, 2014
Ruth D||40||I had seen is so many English movies/shows the deck chairs in Hyde Park London but to actually see people putting them out and people enjoying the sunshine in their lunch break! Great Fun! Th boat house are beautiful and some unique, the ducks, swans and other wildlife. Watching people ride their horses through the park, the squirrels running around... it is a sanctuary amid the hustle and bustle of London.||August 13, 2014

360LoveTravelling13||50||Take a whole day for this itinerary. Get out of the Tube on the Hyde Park station. Walk and enjoy the park (with the help of a map if you need it). You can even print the map at home to have it handy, but there are plenty of maps along the walks. My favorites: - Princess Diana's Memorial Walk and the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain – Amazing design- The flowerbeds- The Serpentine The park is clean, well maintained and the landscaping is very nice. I particularly love the tulips in the Spring. Continue on to the Kensington garden and the palace. The Hyde Park and Kensington gardens are the best green areas in the city.||August 12, 2014
JJYTraveller||50||This is a beautiful and free way to spend the day in London. The gardens are amazing, and you can walk all the way up to Kensington Palace and see the gardens. The Princess Diana memorial is stunning.||August 12, 2014
triki997||40||We were in London during a sunny period. Walking through Hyde Park it was a pleasure to watch so many people out lazing in the sun. It's spacious, relaxing and well worth a look especially if you are feeling a little overwhelmed by the frantic pace of this enormous city.||August 11, 2014
BradJill||40||Hyde Park along with Kensington Gardens is the largest combined green space in London and during the summer, it makes a great location to spend some time outside, away from the chaos of the streets of London. In addition to being able to find plenty of green space where you can sit and enjoy being outside, there are quite a few attractions to enjoy at Hyde Park, including The Long Water and Serpentine Watersheds, which are populated by a wide range of waterfowl. You can also enjoy boating here during the summer if interested. At the north end of The Long is a decent Italian Garden arrangement. There are quite a few interesting monuments and statues to see at and around Hyde Park. These include the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, Peter Pan Statue on the Kensington Garden side of The Long and the nearby, impressive Prince Albert Memorial (Kensington Garden). In the northeast corner of Hyde Park, you can find the very interesting 'Still Water Statue' horse head statue, near the Marble Arch and the famous Speakers Corner. There is a nice collection of War Memorials also found at the southeast corner of Hyde Park for those interested in such attractions. There are a few restaurants and kiosks scattered throughout Hyde Park, plenty of walking paths, park benches and space to have a picnic, lay out and read a book or just enjoy the warm weather of summer. Flower blooms during this time of year also make the park a very nice place to spend time for both residents and visitors to London.||August 10, 2014
jandroid||20||I attended the festival on 4th July. I can't add much more about the park that hasn't already been said so my main comments will be about the festival itself. My friend and I both brought seat sticks, as being of a certain age, are not able to stand around for long periods (I have a number of long term conditions also), however, on entry to the venue we were told we could not take them in with us, although we were not given a specific reason as to why. Fortunately a nearby cafe allowed us to us to leave them there. We watched a couple of bands, very good, I was impressed by Faith No More in particular. Lots of other attractions, but generally drinks and food were expensive. Having travelled from the North East, we had also booked Dinner by Heston Blumenthal to make the most of our visit, but on leaving we were told we would not be allowed back in. There were a number of other irate people wanting to leave, but were basically trapped in the park - it was an extremely hot day and to expect people to stay in the park was completely unacceptable. We went to Dinner hoping to blag our way back in afterwards (see seperate review). We were met with very different responses when we went back to Hyde Park; my friend was let straight in, even with her seat stick, and I was not challenged about either my seat stick or bottle of water that I had in my bag and forgotten about. However, when my ticket was scanned, I was told that as I had been out I could not go back in, and was asked to leave. The woman who was dealing with this was extremely officious and stated that the receipt I had proving I had bought the ticket was 'not a proper receipt', and I should contact the company I bought it from. As there was only an hour left to the end of the event I felt this was rather a 'jobsworth' attitude. When we pointed out that at other festivals people were allowed to come and go as they pleased, we were told 'It's not that kind of festival' - whatever that meant. Eventually another usher allowed us to sneak in to catch the end of the show. I have attended music events, gigs etc for over 30 years, and have never experienced such ridiculously ridged rules. What's more is that the following weekend people were allowed to take chairs, seat still is etc in, and were allowed to come and go as pleased. Whoever has organised the event has some very odd ideas about how rock fans behave if they think that we can't be trusted with sticks, water and whatever else they assume we will bring in if we pop out now and again. The festival itself was good but sadly spoilt for me due stupid and illinformed rules and restrictions. I intend to complain about these issues to the organisers, but I don't think any response will encourage my attendance again.||August 10, 2014
mangoCooper||40||A perfect summer date day. My girlfriend and I rented a boat and went sail.It was definitely worth going to. The lake was very pretty. But the cost was a bit expensive (£24 for two adults for an hour).We also enjoyed some delicious ice cream whist walking around the park.There was also live entertainment there.||August 10, 2014
Athanasios S||50||a huge park vey close to anywhere you Live in the heart of London. You can go for a long walk to chill out or for an early morning run since people start to do their work out there from 5:30 in the morning. Average Running of 10 Km is one round of the park||August 10, 2014

893lynns||40||Hyde Park was a must see for me, because it's mentioned so often in books. Unfortunately, we hit the park after we'd already done a lot of touring. That was a mistake, because the park is enormous. We also had some difficulty finding our way around. It is a beautiful park, but because they'd had so much dry weather, the grass was mostly brown. I'm glad to now have a visual image of Hyde Park, but I'd like to come back some day, when I have the time and energy to do it right.||August 8, 2014
9morganm7||50||Went to see the BST concert on the 4th of july. Great atmosphere for an outdoor venue. Would definitely come back.||August 8, 2014
Tony W||40||You get into Hyde Park and all the hustle and bustle of the city fades away. It is worth the effort just to go there and let your feet recover and your mind wander.||August 8, 2014
MzTaylor88||30||Like previous reviewers have mentioned, this park is an oasis from the hustle and bustle that is London city - especially during the summer months with all of the tourists; the park is so large that it doesn't matter how many people are in the park, there is always plenty of space. If you go for a walk through Hyde Park, you'll come across many statues and water fountains worth a look at or else you could pick some lunch up from the various cafes/food carts and enjoy a picnic in the shade.||August 7, 2014
Im_a_travlin_fool||50||There really is something special about grand parks in the middle of a global city.I spent the day in the park with my daughter on my recent visit to London which consisted of multiple activities;Early morning horse riding around the parkDiana Memorial Children's GardensThe Carousel in that same locationKensington Palace and the GardensThe Serpentine and paddling a boatHide and Seek in the parkGenerally wandering throughout the space from one place to anotherThe Price Albert Memorial looks remarkable as do the rentable deck chairs to relax in or riding a bike though the park.A wonderful experience and a real haven in the middle of the city. I will not forget the time I spent in the park.||August 6, 2014
regulartraveller01||50||A beautiful Oasis to get away from the hustle & bustle of the City. Nice to walk through or stop for a picnic. The Serpentine is nice - we used to swim in it as kids! Perfect location as you are only minutes away from tube. We usually go there as a relaxing pit stop from the usual long list of attractions, venues and theatres that we visit every school holiday! Enjoy it.||August 6, 2014
SandyCadiz-Smith||50||Hyde Park is a wonderful place to spend some time. Straight off the tube and into this large park with the amazing lake (where you can swim if you're so inclined), cafes to chill out in and lots and lots of space. Set right in the middle of London, it's the perfect escape to place when you've had enough of the crowds. Take a picnic and camp out on the grass somewhere...we even saw people barbecuing on the hot summer day we were there. Fabulous.||August 6, 2014
Clairey45||40||Great place if you need some time away from all the hustle and bustle! Recommend a good few hours and a picnic...perfect||August 6, 2014
Paula D||50||Its big and has a changing landscape. Walking round the serpentine is always nice, and then getting to the palace on the other side. Only thing is on weekends specially is sooo full, the serpentine is filled by pedalling boats and theres just loads of people. But its beautiful still!||August 5, 2014
391terit||50||The Rose Garden, the Peter Pan statue, and above all, the ducks, geese, and swans make Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens the most relaxing and rejuvenating part of my trip to London. A beautiful green oasis in the midst of the bustling city! A great place for a picnic!||August 5, 2014

Detski-Audio||50||Certainly my favourite park in London. Hyde Park is a huge park located in central London. On a nice Summer day, the best thing to do is to go and sit by the Serpentine lake. Excellent transport links and very close to Oxford Circus.||August 5, 2014
dwprices||50||Having never been here before, we walked through from Exhibition Road, and found ourselves not only in the middle of London, but in a very quiet, clean pleasant park - and four a while on our own!There seems to be something here for everyone, from horse-riding, tennis, boating, swimming or just sitting and watching. We walked through and was pleasantly amazed at how large and peaceful it was.Would definitely be returning here again.||August 5, 2014
JerryCarol||50||Huge urban park suitable for walking, jogging, boat rides and wildlife observation. On Sundays, the Speakers Corner is alive with people with opinions of everything. ||August 5, 2014

shanidajos||50||Hyde Park is a must if you are visiting the attractions of London, such a beautiful park with many acres of grass, trees, coffee huts and cafe's, you can hire a bike in the park for £2 per 24 hours, and is a fantastic way to get around the park ( and London ).The boating lake is amazing, you can lose hours sitting under a tree relaxing and taking in the lovely views.||August 5, 2014
Andrew H||40||Hyde Park is centrally located so very easy to get to. It's huge too so you could spend some time walking around. It's worth a visit .||August 4, 2014
jerman00||40||Huge park in London with fantastic jogging and walking trails. There is a nice cafe in the middle of the park where I had a nice coffee and watched the geese play. In the summer there is a 10 day music concert called Summer Festival Hyde Park which this year ran from July 4 to July 13.A great park to visit each day on your holiday.||August 3, 2014
WadihC_13||50||Amazing Park for relaxation, escape from the city sounds and the crowd... If you want to find peace then have a walk or take a bicycle at Hyde Park .. Check some shots taken by me there :)||August 3, 2014
alisdairt||40||Every time we come to London, we have a walk through Hyde Park, and experience some thing different. This time we sat in the Italian Gardens for a while in the hot July sun. Then walked down past the Diana Memorial fountain, and watched the children playing in the water, past all the sun worshipers, and boating enthusiasts, and joggers.!!!Whether it be admiring the statues, feeding the ducks and swans, eating ice cream, chillaxing, just go ahead and do it.||August 3, 2014
Mytravel-7202||40||Really nice park for its quietness and greenery. We took some nuts and the kids hand fed a squirrel which was a highlight for them. It is huge so keep this in mind if you're thinking of walking one end to the other. Kensington palace sits at one end which can go inside and tour. There are places to grab a coffee and snack. It's a peaceful retreat from the busyness of London.||August 2, 2014
Muslim101||50||This is a great place for everyone, space, lakes, bikes and refreshments. A good day out to be had here by tourists and non tourists. You wanna feed the ducks then do it here, you wanna ride a bike through the park then do it here, you dance around in the nude shouting out i love life then please don't do it here. To say this park is massive is an understatement, it starts from hyde park corner to marble arch to bayswater to kensington gardens. Now thats big. Enjoy..||August 2, 2014
JenanJamal||50||This is the most famous park in London, Each Time I visit London I've to pass to it just for a walk. It's near Marble Arch. You can rent a boat and drive in the in lake there, You can feed the duck. It's a peaceful place!||August 2, 2014
Siw C||50||The park is a perfect place to relax, take some food and drinks with you and just relax!This park is a perfect place to relax in the middle of the day or at the end of a busy day. Walk around and look at the different sculptures or flowers. Find a nice place to sit and in the summer you can rent a boat! I have never done that, but it can been fun I'm sure of it! The perfect park for a big city like London. ||August 2, 2014
Thung673||50||Our family walked from Harrod's to Hyde park to get some fresh air as well as to get away from the noisy and busy city. This park is genius; lot's of shade, relaxing chairs for hire, lot's of grass to sit down on, in short fabulous park!||August 2, 2014
Vicki H||50||took a picnic lunch and chilled out in the park, was an amazing day by Princess Dianna fountain, totally recommend a walk and visit though the park||August 1, 2014
Hayley B||50||Hyde Park is awesome. There is just so much to see and so much space. We had a lovely sunny day for our visit, and although there were a few people around, it was just nice to be off the busy streets of London in the park. The Albert memorial is great, as is the area around Kensington Palace and the Peter Pan statue. I wish we gave it more time honestly. Was just so peaceful.||August 1, 2014
Lee S||40||and find some shade from the summer sun or rain! Big enough to always find a spot. Downside is if your a girl on your own its best to find a spot near other people incase some cockney annoys you!||August 1, 2014
STEVECLARK||50||Even though we live in this great city,acting like "tourists" is something different.We visited this peaceful and beautiful park yesterday,walking from Lancaster Gate tube station into and through Kensington Park to sit and relax at the Lido cafe.The weather was perfect and watching the world go by,the swans,ducks and other wildlife you didnt realise you where in the centre of our vibrant metropolis.||August 1, 2014
bowenjk||40||Hyde Park in London is a very attractive recreational park. It lacks the magnificent natural botanical character of parks such as the Butchart Gardens on Vancouver Island, Canada or the National Rhododendron Gardens in Victoria, Australia. The lush beauty of those famous gardens is intended to delight the eye and the senses of the visitor who walks their trails but they are not designed for recreational activities apart from walking. On the other hand, Hyde Park draws not only walkers but also joggers, cyclists, and horse riders. Attractive lakeside restaurants such as the Serpentine Bar and Kitchen provide an opportunity for the visitor to relax over a splendid meal while admiring gentle activities on the lovely Serpentine lake including the attentions of swans and ducks hoping for diners to feed them. Londoners are very fortunate to have such a lovely recreational park in the centre of their city.||July 31, 2014
Tinka1523||50||Make sure you hire the push bikes it's a great way to see the park very invigorating:) and cheap! lunch by the lake and Princess Di's memorial is amazing!||July 31, 2014
chris c||40||to say london has so many green spaces they soon fill up on the weekendbut it was nice to see the rose garden and surrounding flower beds in full blooma haven in a bustling city||July 31, 2014
kalbet26||40||The most interesting thing happened when we passed through the brick entry of Hyde Park...the city noise completely vanished! It was a pleasant walk through the park, around Kensington Palace and out to Albert Memorial (my favorite monument in London)||July 30, 2014
poco159||40||do spend some time there on a sunday morning.we were told only fanatics stand there but we really enjoyed the "battles".||July 30, 2014
scranton38||50||I have never seen a park like this before...in my life! We loved every minute of our time here. There are tons of things to do, not the least of which is just lay on a blanket and watch people. Get the honeycomb ice cream (whippy) at the restaurant on the tip of the lake, for sure. One of the best things I had while in London. You can feed the birds, take a boat out on the water, tons of photographs to be taken, and again, just people watch. We saw girls riding horses and boys practicing their skateboarding. There are lots of people out and about, even during the week. It added to the fun, I think. The parks around my home are mostly devoid of people, but this one was a favorite, you could tell.||July 29, 2014
REDCOL14||40||Really good gig. Short taxi journey away or a 20 to 30 minute walk. Worth a trip to the artists displays on Saturday/Sunday mornings.||July 29, 2014
Susanulrich||50||We were there in January and the park was quite active. There were bikers, runners, people with their dogs and children... even a group a roller skaters putting on a performance. The statues and flowers were beautiful. I can see why so many movies are filmed here. So much to absorb.||July 28, 2014
IamJak||40||Too big flat and empty for my taste, but it is still my favorite park in London. They have an excellent restaurant on the water here, everyone orders the diavola pizza. You will find many local people and tourists. Within walking distance is Buckingham and Marble Arch.||July 28, 2014
RoyBoy53||50||Walked through this beautiful park on Friday and was amazed at how peaceful it was. Walked round the Serpentine and thoroughly enjoyed the scenery. Also enjoyed watching the squirrels scampering about. Plenty of places to stop and sit and watch the world go by. Met up with our daughter and granddaughters and spent a lovely time in the Princess Diana Memorial Garden (until the heavens opened). First time here but will definitely be back.||July 27, 2014
499joannew||50||As it has been very hot in Britain this last few weeks we thought we would pay a visit to Hyde Park and have a dip in the Serpentine Lido. It cost £10 entrance for 2 adults and a child and the changing areas wear clean. The river was lovely and cool but as you would expect it was pretty murky. My son didn't care, his first river swim was wonderful!||July 26, 2014
MostafaA424||50||I enjoy walking,sitting and observing people enjoying.i have never been to London without paying several visits to this beautiful gardens.the week we spent in London was sunny so we enjoyed the Hyde Park daily||July 26, 2014
Priscilla S||40||We went to the park to let the kids blow off some steam. They played soccer and we sat around and picnicked. It was a beautiful summer evening and all of London seemed to have the same idea. So many young adults brought light food to picnic on the grass. Great sunset and relaxing. ||July 25, 2014
Robin M||50||One of the great city parks of the world. Fantastic statues, just great to lay on the grass and think about who had been there before||July 24, 2014
luba496||50||My 2 best friends and I visited foggy London during the summer of our junior year at Rutgers University in Newark, NJ. It was our first stop during our 8 week trek through Europe. We stayed at a basement apartment which was OK but didn't have a private bath so we washed our hair in the sink in our room & often took sponge baths because the one public bathroom was always busy-U could only do this if you're a teenager!We visited all the historical and cultural attractions-saw the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace (the guards in uniform didn't blink!) saw the London Bridge (it looked like it was falling down!) and toured the famous London Tower with its many prison cells-you could almost hear the cries of the prisoners as they were being tortured! The guides on all the tours were very informative with a British sense of humor, which we often didn't understand, but we loved the accent!We heard the chiming of the humongous Big Ben near the Cathedral. My favorite meal was fish and chips with beer and vanilla ice cream, which was yellow b/c of the large amount of butter-at that time was in shape. Many pigeons at Trafalgar Square where we rested at the fountain and ate many sandwiches. I wanted to visit Oxford, but we were on a schedule and didn't have time-next time...My sister & her year old son are visiting London this October. I told them to say hello to the Queen and hug baby George! Cheerio!||July 24, 2014
haileythegolden||50||The lust green grass and beautiful flowers and gardens is a highlight of the park. The park has many kilometres of walking paths and I notice a lot of people jogging. If you have time to wander the park and enjoy the vegetation would be a relaxing day. We caught the original hop on hop on bus at Hyde park ||July 23, 2014
Bryonaay||50||My boyfriend and I visited Hyde Park on our trip to London and decided to have a picnic, we were blessed with the beautiful weather which probably emphasised the gorgeousness of the nature. Everyone minds their own business at the park and that was one of the main aspects which I love about London itself. We were able to have a picnic around other people without being disturbed even though there was many people and people playing sport. We were both really happy to see the amount of sport that was being played around the park (football, cycling, rounders etc.) and this made the park more pleasurable. The lake in the middle of the park is very attractive and was lovely to watch the boats that you could hire on there. Police regulate the park often, which made us feel at ease. The bar where you could also eat seemed appealing but was very busy so we couldn't find a seat. We spent the most of 5 hours at the park and didn't even get bored, such a lovely time ||July 23, 2014
ritzytraveller||50||This was our second visit to Hyde park,the first being in november last year on a visit to London. Went here with my wife and 2 kids. To really enjoy this place the best thing to do is walk around the lake and just take in the beauty of the place. The paddleboating is fun and they have tickets for 30mins and 1 hr. There are playareas for the kids. The Serpentine restaurant is avoidable so go there only for a light snack or beverage to sit and enjoy the view.||July 23, 2014
ZfyEd||40||We came here for a walk after visiting the Kensington Gardens, just nearby. We were so impressed with it. Its such a nice and lovely park where one can easily find a quiet place to indulge in its tranquillity, relax and lay back from the hectic and busy city life.Inside the park, there are well laid walking pavements leading to different parts of the park. While walking on these pavements, one can enjoy the greenery and flora, monument statutes, lakes and simply enjoy watching the passers by or visitors. The air is fresh and after experiencing this, one can feel that time has slowed down.This place is well-known internationally as a place for allowing anyone to criticize the policies, government, politicians or anyone without being "arrested" but unfortunately on the day of our visit, we did not manage to see any. We were told that we had came much earlier (Wednesday) and if its Sunday, there will be a big crowded of "speakers" here.The park is also near to many amenities such as hotels, restaurants and cafeterias and so you can grab a bite or have a cup of coffee to relax after visiting the park. Madame Tussauds museum is about 12 minutes of walk from the park and following that, there are shopping and entertainment facilities as well.Although one can take the circle line of the tube to reach here (we didn't), we came here taking the city sightseeing bus on a full-day pass with unlimited rides on-and-off.Its a nice and good place to visit and get immersed in its beauty and charm!||July 23, 2014
CMcLean23||50||Great spot by the Serpentine to people watch, grab an ice cream and chill out on a hot day. The kiosks are remarkably good vale for such a tourist hotspot.||July 22, 2014
HAR225||50||Hyde park combines with Kensington gardens to form a wonderful park with lakes, monuments, horse riding, political soap boxing on a Sunday and even pop festivals - you can easily spend a day in here but a couple of hours would give you a breather from the relentless pace of London town.Take the Circle Line tube (Yellow) or District Line tube (green) to High Street Kensington and turn right out of the station to walk for about 4 minutes along the busy shopping street then cross over to the entrance to Kensington gardens. Near here is Diana's former home Kensington Palace and the poignant memorial to the wonderful lady. Walk on parallel with the busy road on to encounter the Albert Memorial and across the road the Albert Hall music venue - memorials to her dead husband built by the great Empress of the British Empire - Queen Victoria.Turn left here and walk 5 minutes North to find the Serpentine lake and bridge - notice the horse riding sand tracks away to the right as you go, this is where the Queen's horse soldiers practice every morning- (very early) - it's called "Rotten Row" guess why!Head North East over the bridge to reach Marble Arch and Speakers Corner after about 15 minutes - the official centre of London. On Sunday mornings you can listen to all manner of political speeches here as people exercise their right to free speech.Turn right and walk down the swanky Park Lane passing famous hotels and car showrooms to reach the other end of the park at Hyde Park Corner and the Hilton hotel. Here is the museum to the famous "Iron Duke" Wellington and the awe inspiring memorial to commonwealth soldiers.Just over from here is the Queen's back yard at Buckingham palace but that's another story....If you are worn out by now there is a tube station at Marble Arch and another to the left of the Wellington House on Piccadilly (near the Ritz Hotel)A great day out and FREE WOOOOT||July 22, 2014
towncrier_ns||50||It is always nice to visit Hyde Park, relaxing, great walking paths and great for people watching. Always something going on here, and it is a good central point to orient yourself when visiting London. Good hotels, eateries and attractions nearby.||July 22, 2014
OsmanB511||50||if you are seeking for few moments of tranquility far from the city noises then this huge park will be the place to be. you will enjoy the nature (different kinds of roses, trees etc...). Squirrels and pigeons will surround you. if you are there for a walk or biking or just for a seat on a bench you will admire it. not to mention the activities that you may witness there.||July 22, 2014
Bucko007||30||Hyde Park was not as busy as all the rest of the tourist spots In London. It was on a Sunday so maybe it was not as busy. The trails are very nice. We would have loved to have seen the Diana memorial but we got as far as the beautiful fountains. Regent park is much nicer.||July 20, 2014
D8723FPlisac||50||As an admirer of Central Park in NYC, Hyde Park is a challenger for my favorite! Just stunning views--rose gardens, beautiful landscaping, sculptures and monuments scattered throughout, Kensington Palace and it's gardens are on site, as well as the quietly reflective Princess Diana memorial fountain. Serpentine Lake is so pretty with swans galore. And you can rent paddle and rowing boats to traverse the lake. A few cafés dot the sidelines of the lake where you can have a snack, glass of wine or coffee while admiring the incredible views. It's easy to spend several hours here---we did! Behind Hyde Park is embassy row which was a neat find. You can amble past many of the beautiful embassies. This was one of our very favorite places in London.||July 20, 2014
Grahame W||50||While recently visiting London with my wife and teenage daughter, we were so lucky to be staying near a couple of lovely parks Hyde and Kensington. It was such a breath of fresh air to be able to enjoy the beauty of these places in a city like London. London can be fast paced and engulfing and to escape to hyde park was a great welcome with it's abundance of nature. If ever your visiting London for a few days and you feel like getting away from all the tourist attractions(as well as tourist), then I fully recommend spending a couple of hours just taking-in the beauty within the beast, you won't be disappointed believe me:)||July 20, 2014
spacy87||40||If you need a break from the noise and clamor of the city then Hyde Park is a welcome escape. There are nice spaces to relax in the shade, swimming areas for when its hot, lovely places for the family dog to run around, and plenty of sights to see such as the peter pan statue, the Albert Memorial, and Kensington Palace. ||July 19, 2014
Sterling E||50||Had a nice relaxing walk around the park to get to my Hotel while I was on Holiday and enjoyed it very much. I wasn't able to go around the whole park because of how enormous it was though. Basically this park was the beginning of my vacation in London and brought a great impression of how lovely London is. So many different activities going on here. The wind blowing leaves around made it feel as if I was in a movie! Not to mention , I did not see any homeless people around! If you want to get away for a while , I'd recommend coming here to relax your mind and body!||July 18, 2014
oscarwestling||50||Great for just about anything during the summertime. Whether you're a runner, biker or just like to sit in the sun and enjoy an ice cream - Hyde Park is the place for you.||July 18, 2014
Angela K||40||Set up nicely an enjoyable walk with young children love the areas in memory of princess Diana the children play areaNeeds better signage to where things are and more maps||July 17, 2014
WayneAZ||40||Riding rented bikes through Hyde Park was one of our favorite experiences in London. I would recommend it. Not quite as good as Central Park but it is a great park and it backs up to Kensington Palace, where William & Kate live... Was fun to ride over to that Palace and take pics.||July 16, 2014
Evremonde||50||Ended up at Hyde Park for a meal and a drink after a day of walking and shopping, great food & great atmosphere.||July 16, 2014
Kiwi15||50||We picked out our Boris Bikes in Hyde park and off we went for the princely sum of £2 each we had 2 hrs of such fun cycling around this wonderful park. Visited the serpentine where everyone was cooling their feet, over the bridge and along the otherside of the park, we saw people rowing boats, running, walking and horse riders, then when we thought it couldn't get any better, we heard music, I don't know what was on in the park, but we heard all the music of our era, the 60s and 70s, lots of Beetle numbers and more. What a glorious day.Tip: you can have the use of the bikes free for the first 30mins, do if you can be bothered, just keep swapping the bike every 30 mins. Cheap day out if there is a few of you.||July 16, 2014
Shane T||30||It was an enjoyable relaxing afternoon with mates at Hyde Park, but there was far too many people in and around the area to find a spot to sit.What made it worst was after we had paid for our bench seats, we were asked to pay again cause our receipts were "not valid". The behaviour of the staff members was condescending and rude after we explained that we already paid for them.I would've marked this location quite highly for tourist to relax, but not in the manner in which we were spoken to by the patrol staff.||July 15, 2014
Justine1001||40||Went to see the BST concert in Hyde Park July 2014. Fantastic venue! brilliant day out, can definitely recommend. Very well organised event and security were really good and very visible.||July 15, 2014
arina1836||40||on our first day there was a show in the park (don't know who was the performer), when it was finished, we saw through our window in the Cumberland hotel thousands of people walking out the park. we enjoyed the neigbourhood of the park walking along and enjoying the relaxation of the grass.||July 15, 2014
LesleyLamb||40||Visited for the BST family day, great event and enjoyed the peddle boats. Got Amazon local vouchers so worked out half price of the ticket face value, so that was good.||July 14, 2014
Kilwinnkie||40||Day trip to London while staying with friends and spent some time in the park and really enjoyed. Lots to see and do, including hiring some deckchairs for a small rest. Well worth it if you are walking the rest of the day.||July 14, 2014
enyapyendys||50||Saw the brilliant Neil Young and Crazy Horse. What a brilliant place for a concert venue! Very well organised. Toilets surprisingly clean!||July 14, 2014
nic0903||50||Hyde park is amazing ! We went to the bst fest and it was one of the best experiences ever ... Crowd behaved well, plenty of things to do and not over priced ! Oh and the band's were brilliant.The park itself is a huge warren of little ponds , big ponds , gardens , fountains , cafes , the serpentine gallery is fab and the open air art exhibition on the Lancaster gate side during Sunday is wonderful ! I could go on for hours about how great the place is , perfect way to relax on a steaming hot day||July 13, 2014
Sam A||50||I think it's the best of london. Spent days there. It's like a paradise. Super hot in the afternoon,but quite chilly before sunset. You can just lie on the grass for the whole day.||July 11, 2014
Jenny0401||30||Hyde park does not really have anything to special about it. It is quite a large park next to Kensington palace gardens. It has a lake which you can hire paddle boats, with gravel paths and the standard grass and trees. The section which contains the memorial to princess Dianna, was really disappointing. The memorial is large flat circular water feature, which is like small water rapids , so the water flows down to one point and is pumped back up again. Many people did not respect this memorial and follow the signs asking people not to climb over the memorial. It allows you to dangle your feet into the water, but children and adults were climbing all over the rapids like it was a water ride at a park.||July 11, 2014
Sham A||40||It was just too big for us to explore. Wish we had more time. So many people jogging in the morning or enjoying the late afternoon walk with families and friends.||July 10, 2014
Hallie14||50||One of the best city parks to have a nice long walk around :) Such a clean and well looked after park. great to relax in the sun or have a nice walk wat ever the weather.||July 10, 2014
views_gal_in_town||50||When i think of a park, i remember views of parks in Pasadena in California or Central Park in New York City, but the Hyde Park in London tops them all. Not only is it a park where trees thrive amongst the most luxurious of English tea roses exhuming fragrant scents but there is also a place where one can gallop one's horses on soil, not grass, without being reprimanded. There are miles after miles of open areas for talking relaxing walk or for jogging which is what I saw last sunday afternoon and the air is of the highest degree of freshness. It clearly shows that this park is highly maintained for tourists as well as the normal folks who come, sit and enjoy. Seek and you shall find your own nook to experience nature at its best!||July 10, 2014
Bblynko||50||Best place in London to hide from rush and noise. Just you and youre book :) love it! Grate for picnic.||July 10, 2014
David O||50||Visited this park while here and enjoyed every minute. I definitely recommend coming to see this park. Will take one day to cover the whole park :)||July 9, 2014
Lyndy B||40||You can walk a long way here on the paths and just spend some time decompressing if you are feeling a little stressed with the pace of city life. Many joggers enjoy this area and there are places you can stretch out on the grass or under a tree. It is also a nice shortcut through the city when you are walking from one attraction to another. ||July 9, 2014
KenmareLisa||50||Plant to spend the day if visiting because Hyde Park is very large and has plenty of things to do and see. My favorite is the Diana Fountain and the Rose Garden. The garden always smells so amazing and while visiting this June it was filled with stunning colors as well. Pack or buy lunch, bring a frisbee, maybe there will be a concert playing in the background(there usually is) and just enjoy the day and people watch. It's FREE, so take advantage!||July 8, 2014
Marguerite B||50||How lucky for Londoners and for tourists to have this magnificent park in the centre of the city. You can relax, exercise, people watch, eat..... and it was a wonderful way to stroll from my hotel in Paddington to a multitude of tourist areas.||July 8, 2014
waveatthecar||40||Hyde Park is massive, so a good venue for a concert/festival. Barclaycard British Summer Time was a great event. Inside the park were rides, food stalls, bars, and a variety of stages. One stage (the one that 5ive were supposed to play) collapsed and so those acts unfortunately were cancelled :(Drinks were expensive - £6.50 for a single spirit and mixer, £20 for a bottle of cheap wine - however, a bottle of wine between two was plenty for the event, as we were there to appreciate the music and not get wasted. Food was also quite expensive, but not ridiculously so. There were so many options: hog roast, pulled pork, pizza, chips, burger, Japanese food, Chinese food, noodles, fudge.... Make sure you have a look around before you decide on something. I would recommend slow roasted lamb :) It came in a burger bap and was served with ketchup and mayo.The acoustics were great; there were speakers everywhere and a couple of screens further back for those who weren't right at the front. As short people, my friend and I stood further back so that we could see the stage over taller people's heads but could also see the screen for a close up. It was much more relaxed that little bit further back. Lots of people brought blankets with them, and positioned themselves on the pieces of grass out of the way of the main stage to drink. Some people had brought a massive picnic too, which I'm sure saved them some money, however, you're not allowed to bring in any liquid. You are allowed to bring in empty bottles and there are lots of water filling stations positioned around the event area.Tickets fro general admission weren't very expensive. We saw Backstreet Boys, McBusted, and other less important acts for £25. Some were able to get even cheaper tickets!For posh bods, there was a covered seating area with a decent view of the main stage.||July 8, 2014
ross_drew||40||Nice big park full of runners and geese. British Summer Time festival in July is pretty decent also.||July 8, 2014
TJA1987||50||Had a great time around the vast Hyde Park. Really great for all the family and a good place to chill out on a summers day. I went to the British Summer Time Festival on July 4th 2014 to see Black Sabbath, Soundgarden, Faith No More, Motorhead and Soulfly but spent time in the park before the gates opened. Around the Serpentine is always pretty good. There are many places to get drinks and ice creams particularly important at this time of year. Fairly easy walk from Victoria (which I recommend in the Summer) also easy to access from Marble Arch, Green Park and Hyde Park Corner London Underground Stations. Hyde Park is a perfect place to relax after shopping down the road in Knightsbridge!!!||July 7, 2014
johnn182||50||My wife and I walked to Hyde Park several times while in London for the beginning of our honeymoon. We stayed at the Thistle Hyde Park hotel and it was an easy walk across the street to enjoy this beautiful park. We spent some time just wondering around and admiring the beautiful nature that was all around us. Another time, we brought books with us and just relaxed in the park. Loved visiting Hyde Park. ||July 6, 2014
Hatfield_visitor||50||Walked through the park to attend BST concert. Park looked a great place to spend a few hours relaxing and walking. Several cafes to visit. Great place to spend a quiet summers day||July 6, 2014
Izabela G||50||You have to ride here everywhere. London's hiring bike is really good, definately a good idea to get to o e side tothe other of the park. No wonder it is one of the main attractions! AMAZING!||July 6, 2014
Bev W||50||Just got back from Libertines at Hyde Park! Wow! Accessibility was unbelievable! Always worry about being able to get about at this sort of thing but it was faultless from parking to getting to venue! All involved were polite, helpful and organised! Again I say WOW!||July 6, 2014
FranciscoCcc||50||One of the most beautiful parks I've ever seen. Beautiful gardens, stunning fountains, and plenty of ducks to look at :). The park is huge and it takes some time. But go!||July 5, 2014

Frank L||20||It is a nice park but the owners of that dogs like pitbulls let them free there and the dogs are hunting after birds and squirills. The dog owners shout at the dog and the dogs do not clare. Terrible place. Why there is no law against that bad attitute ?||July 3, 2014
Daniellerenee90||50||My husband and I went here to kill some time before the changing of the guard... we didn't want to leave! This park is huge and there are so many things to see but all are absolutely beautiful and unique.||July 3, 2014
m0d||40||Lovely park on a Sunday. easily accessible , marvelous walks and decent priced tea and snacks available. Visited Speakers corner. I remember when it was teaming with ideas and controversy. Now however it is full of religeous speakers. So much so that it is boring. Graeat to see Barclays biking scheme used so much. People joging, cycling, skating and of course that great British pastime - walking the dog.||July 3, 2014

HAVEFUN000||50||It is so relaxing to stroll through the grounds of this huge park in the afternoon. You can go and see the ducks and swan swimming happily close at the water's edge, ever eager for some tasty treats from the locals and tourists alike. There is a memorial fountain to Princess Diana in the park, which is quite simple, yet unique in its design. There is a sense of peace and tranquility around the 'fountain'. The park is a great place to visit just to chill and enjoy the beauty and peace of this lovely park.Tip: If you want a snack or meal, the boat shed cafe is at the waters edge in the park & it's a great spot to enjoy the beauty of the park while taking a refreshing break.||July 2, 2014
Robert S||50||In short: Bicycles, boats, shoreline seating, ice cream, and adjacency to both other large green spaces and a number of good tourist sites. As far as a park inside of a large metropolitan area, it's hard for me to know what would be better than this!Hyde Park is a mostly flat grassy area of some 350 acres dotted with trees and some minor slopes or hills. I believe when coupled with Kensington Gardens, a green area to the west and directly attached of Hyde Park, it makes up the largest contiguous green space in London, but it is still smaller than New York's Central Park (Kensington and Hyde Park are around 625 acres combined versus Central Park at 843 acres). I only draw the comparison since I believe Central Park is a generally good benchmark for a beautiful city park.However, size isn't everything, and Hyde Park is nice for the number and arrangement of walking paths, and the different monuments and memorials scattered throughout. The pricing of the rowboats or paddleboats is reasonable and splashing around the Serpentine, the pond in the center of Hyde Park, is nice for the time given. The rowing area is large enough to give you an area to get around in and keep clear of the other seafarers. Additionally, the whole space is quite bicycle friendly in terms of paths, pedestrian etiquette, and access to rental bikes.Bicycle rental is best accommodated with use of the Barclay Cycle Hire stations located at several points along the perimeter of the park. The Barclay Bikes, AKA Boris Bikes by the locals, are heavy 3 geared machines, but they're sturdy, the chains are safe from pant legs, and they can shift gears at a stop unlike standard gearing systems used a bike, making them very friendly to casual and pick up cyclists. In addition to being great for riding around the parks, the bikes can be taken to various other sites in the city as any Barclay Bike can be picked up or returned at any Barclay Bike station using only a credit card; I believe a chip credit card is necessary but it doesn't have to be a chip and pin card, unlike many other automated kiosks.However, there is still more to do in and around Hyde Park aside from a wonderful walk, a romantic boat ride, and a breezy cycling jaunt. Within Hyde Park itself is the famous Speakers Corner, a place for public oration and an okay site to see as a tourist since you're already nearby, but even better is the proximity to the historic Kensington Palace in Kensington Gardens and Buckingham Palace next to the Green Park to the east of Hyde Park. Both are worth tourist sites and provide great sightseeing opportunities.All of this adds up to a very strong 4 out of 5 rating, but Hyde Park has a few extra nearby sites that bring this park up to a solid five for sight seers. To the south of the park are the Natural History and Science museums, as well as the iconic Harrods department store if you are inclined to shop. To the east is the Hard Rock Cafe which I didn't visit, but if you like checking them out, it's definitely conveniently situated. The west of the park is, of course, Kensington, which contains a good variety of shops and restaurants; I stayed in that area on my last visit and I did not find myself wanting for anything while there.Adding up the standard but quality amenities, the niceness of the grounds themselves, and the great location within London, this park is easily the base for a whole day of activities. That makes it a top notch recommendation in my books!||July 1, 2014
moranclan||50||What a beautiful park with horse trails, walking/running paths and a great sense of space and quiet. It's quite astonishing actually that there is this incredible oasis in the middle of such a large and vibrant city. We were impressed with how clean the park is, and loved the ponds. Pick up some great takeaway food and enjoy the peace of Hyde Park.||July 1, 2014

101stefanz||30||There are lots of stories featuring Hyde Park so, naturally, expectations are being high up in the sky. But in the end of the day ... its just a park. Its nicely kept in shape, has some lawns to relax, a small water to watch the ducks but that's it.There are horses going for a walk, lots of people doing sports. Its nice to walk and to have been there, but there are more beautiful parks around the world than this one.||July 1, 2014
Chuck G||50||Lovely grounds filled with outdoor lovers and adjacent to the remarkable Kensington Gardens. I am a runner and usually make a nice long run through the parks. There is plenty to do there for all ages/or not do and simply relax in the beauty with City of London as the backdrop! A must see||June 30, 2014
redhead_roaming||50||You wouldn't think in the middle of a busy city that you could find something so gorgeous but yet, here it is! There are so many beautiful flowers and if that's what you fancy, it's perfect for you!!||June 29, 2014
Robert18651||40||On a recent visit our family spent a lot of time in the park walking, sitting and talking. The surroundings are well laid out and organised. Those who frequent the park are from all walks of life and this makes it even more enjoyable when walking around. A lovely safe city park.||June 28, 2014
Colleen D||40||We stayed near the park and walked through it several times on our way to other places. It is a vast park and I know we didn't even see the half of it, but what we did see was lovely. There are formal areas like the Italian Pool and then other areas with wild blackberry bushes and natural grasses. If you happen to walk past the Henry Moore Arch Sculpture you can see all the way to Kensington Palace in the distance, but also be sure to look for the bunnies frolicking in the grass around the sculpture. The area is enclosed by a fence and the bunnies have figured out that off-leash dogs are not a threat to them there. Near the Peter Pan statue we saw a duck sitting on a nest in the lake - and we saw cygnets (young swans) swimming around under the protective eye of their parents. Of course there are lots of people strolling, riding horses, playing soccer, walking their dogs, etc, but you can easily find areas that are quiet and secluded to read or take an impromptu nap. My only wish is that there were a few more restrooms available. We found one eventually near the restaurant by the boathouses. Walking across the park can take 20-30 minutes; to circumnavigate the park you'd probably need an hour and a half - so allow yourself plenty of time to wander and enjoy.||June 28, 2014

1934185Kentcouple||50||Having lived and worked in and around all my life I am happy to say that recent retirement has given us the opportunity to take the train and bus (brilliant routemaster - both old and new) to this amazing place.We entered at Palace Gate we you can by a fantastic bacon or sausage roll which seemed a little pricey at first but was substantial whilst delicious plus a decent cup of tea or coffee also the staff were pleasant and helpful.This was our second visit this month due to other commitments close by, so we have completed a substantial amount of the park area.All life, both dog, bird and human congregate here in complete harmony. The park enjoys plenty of runners and the Boris bikes are ideal for getting about as is the liberty bus.We have skirted Kensington Palace, enjoyed the Italianette Gardens, Peter Pan's statue and most of the others, visited the Princess of Wales fountain and walked right around the boating lake at the serpentine. Great to see lots of pedalos out in the current hot spell. Huge variety of birds, plants and trees - wild meadow also maintained. Fantastic close up views of the commanding Albert Memorial looking toward his beautiful concert hallThere are plenty of good quality refreshment areas but if you are on a budget you can take your own lunch.Just so much to see and do and far too much to list - simply just go and visit it for yourself rather than just pass it by. There is something for everybody.||June 26, 2014

ceciliamorrison||50||London is so lucky to have so many parks in the city. I think Hyde Park is the very best one. Lovely large majestic trees, lots of grass, deck chairs, benches, well kept gardens. Some formal and other areas have a more natural look about them. Set in the middle of the park is the Serpentine. On either side if this stretch of water is a restaurant. There are also two Galleries to visit which are free. There is also a Japanese Restaurant set behind one of the galleries. This is a very attractive restaurant, a bit like a large sculpture. The food is delicious but expensive, it would be perfect for that special occasion. There are many entrances to the Park and therefore a few tubes serve different entrances. It is a place for everybody, walkers, runners, dog walkers, sunbathers and for just having fun!||June 25, 2014
wcentrone||40||I love running in Hyde Park. I went this afternoon after a full day of meetings. Cutting through Kensington Gardens - I weaved my way past The Serpetine, staying mostly on the dirt trails that are hidden throughout the park. Two things really stuck out for me - (1) the enormous number of smokers. I don't remember this many smokers the last time I ran in Hyde Park (or all of London for that matter). My second realization, this is a fantastic urban park that has a true "neighborhood" feel. People really use the park. From families walking the perimeter, to cyclists racing around the laps in pace lines. Hyde Park is a big deal park in one of the most influential cities in the world.||June 25, 2014
SunnyPattyPig||50||The gardens at Hyde Park were beautiful. It is an easy stroll from Buckingham Palace up through Hyde Park to where the Lady Diana Memorial Fountain is located. There are many park benches, the rose garden is lovely and the quiet setting is a welcome respite from the noisy city center. I loved the gorgeous swans!||June 23, 2014

lindacschoeps||50||A perfect getaway from all the hustle and bustle of the big city. The perfect spot for those who needs to calm down and relax. Go to Hyde Park, and you can walk around there for hours. Take a walk, hire a bike, go horseback riding, feed the birds and squirrels, go rowing in the lake/-s, or just sit down with a cup of tea/coffee or eat something. You surely will appreciate to get away from the traffic!||June 23, 2014
GailSTivano||50||We chose the smaller Cafe near the Princess Di Memorial Garden. Although choices were limited the outdoor area offered a lovely ambience on a beautiful sunny day and the stroll back to main road extremely pleasant The garden beds are beautiful!||June 23, 2014
PhilipM312||50||Make a point of taking a walk through of this country-setting-within-a-city gem. There are horse paths, lakes, bicycling lanes, and pedestrian only paths for every mode of transport. Kensington Palace on one end, Speakers Corner on the other. Its "squareness" compared to NYC's Central Park distances you even more from the bustle than that masterpiece of urban planning.||June 22, 2014

Also don't miss Speakers' Corner as one of the famous historial sites in the park. It really is amazing to walk the grounds and not see the city buildings and hear the noise of London. Nice break from the big city.||June 18, 2014

I travelled from Nottingham with my Uni ice Soc and we had the best time skating in a wonderful christmas atmosphere i have never felt quite so festive. The experience after the skating was also wonderful, there were craft stalls and food stalls to have a look at. As well as some delicious food stalls. I had a delicious hog roast sandwich. I would definitely make the trip again.||June 15, 2014

SergeLourie||50||I recently decided to walk from Notting Hill to Piccadilly as I had a bit of time to spare. It took just over an hour. I walked through Kensington gardens and then along the south shore of the Serpentine. It was early evening and there was a lot going on with many runners, walkers, boaters and people relaxing. It was good to see a 5K running race in progress after walk with around 300 competitors.A lot of people were running or cycling home from work and there ware many walking home with their briefcasesMost attractive was the area near Hyde Park Corner where there were some lovely gardens where oe could sit on a bench and admire the attractive flowers.||June 8, 2014
MissMLD||50||We visited Hyde Park on a recent visit to London, and it was lovely, helped by the beautiful weather .We entered the park from Hyde Park Tube station, which brought us in via the Rose garden, the fragrance from the varied plants and flowers was incredible.Throughout the park there are plenty of benches or grassed areas that you can sit on and watch the world go by. We hired a pedalo on the Serpentine for an hour, although a little expensive at £12 per adult, was good fun and a nice way to relax with a good view of the park.Will definitely visit here again and have a good explore around.||June 7, 2014
Noraatc||50||I was very surprised to see "terrible" ratings for Hyde Park, but the realized that all the reviewers are referring to Christmas season. Well, we were there on a beautiful May day and the park was in bloom. We loved walking there...sitting at the pond and looking at graceful swans and funny ducks was also very nice. We walked all the way from Green Park up to Kensington Gardens and Prince Albert Memorial and enjoyed every minute of it. Gorgeous park!||June 6, 2014
LasVegasSlim||50||Next to Kensington Park and the Lady Diana Memorial and down the street from the Victoria & Albert Museum, it's a pleasant break from the rush-rush of trying to cram all the sites in. Take a break, walk leisurely through the park, stroll reverently through the Lady Diana Memorial and Fountain, and reflect on yourself and how lucky you just might be to be in London, while others before us are gone.While in February we had no flowers in bloom, but the beauty of the park still comes through. The lake, the paths, the memorial fountain all speak serenity. Enjoy them because they speak volumes of how the British honor their own. The story behind the Lady Diana Fountain is fascinating how it starts calm, then grows more turbulent, very turbulent then calm again, as it describes her life. What a tribute. Rest in Peace Diana.We can't wait to get back during the Spring when all is in bloom and spend time just taking it all in again.||June 6, 2014
Brito_34||40||We rented bikes and rode through the park on a sunny day. We were disappointed at the Princess Diana memorial. Seems a bit too minimalist for someone that so resonated with the people.||June 6, 2014

CatherineHeinemann||50||Such a vast expansion of land which is absolutely beautiful. Away from the hustle and bustle of the roads it is lovely to be able to walk around and see the squirrels and birds and people who bring their dogs that simply run along beside their bicycles, very well behaved! Loved seeing people bring their dogs and letting them play together. We took a very large walk around the park in order to find the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain (took a bit of finding, but perhaps we werent the best at directions in this case). Felt very privilidged to go and stand near the fountain and take some snaps of the beautiful roses in the surrounding gardens. We saw people doing horse riding through the grounds, and on our first day in London, BBCs Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park was on so we got to enjoy the sounds of James Blunt and Jack Johnson for free among many others. (Our hotel was also right near the entrance to the park so we could hear the concert continuing on when we got back to our room which was great). on our final day we saw a marathon that was being run to benefit Teenage Cancer Trust and Great Ormond Street amongst others. It was a great atmosphere. Would be lovely to sit and read if you ever meed a relaxing place to go.||June 3, 2014

ltrayers||40||I am amazed by the bird life you will find in Hyde Park. Black and white swans, ducks of every variety, and some brightly feathered birds that I do not know how to classify. Bring a camera to capture the wild life.The Princess Diana fountain is lovely and the kids can role up their pants and wade in the waters. A lovely tribute.Other than that, Hyde Park is for walking and enjoying the outdoors. Have a picnic or stop for a rest by the Italian Fountains. You can spend an afternoon exploring all of its hidden pathways and lovely gardens. Bring sunscreen.||June 2, 2014
lilach2||50||We walked through the park; saw a field surrounded by a fence with hares...The Serpentine gallery was closed but we entered to the restaurant, which is Hadid Zaha' s work ( the architect) and it is the new extension to the gallery .Fantastic work!

jenniferwilliams7||50||A great park to just walk in and enjoy the seasonal flowers is Hyde Park. Our recent visit in May led us to enjoy the lovely spring flowers planted there. We walked through the lanes enjoying the sunshine, fountains and landscaping. This is also an excellent park to run or jog in as there are many paths and shaded areas. You can also visit Kensington Palace there; it is located in one of the corners of the park. At another end is the lovely Prince Albert Memorial and still further on is Marble Arch. Check out the Italian Gardens with sparkling fountains, waterways and flowers. We also saw some horse back riders on the trail next to us.||May 30, 2014
Anca F||50||It is wonderful to have such a green place in the middle of a busy city. Even a 10 min walk there can give you a lot of joy and energy.||May 29, 2014
Patrick112999||50||A very well maintained park which suits everyone...It is the largest park in Central London, and is free to all.. In the Serpetine (lake), you could hire a boat in the Summer, whether you just want a walk or kick a football, this is the place to go. If you are into birds, then the chances are you probably get to see different kind of birds/swans/ducks at close distance around the Italian Fountains (closest station Lancaster Gate). However, different ducks & swans do swim & fly around the Serpertine & Round Pond, though they are doing landscaping work.Cycling is allowed in parts of the park [basically where the paths are wider], but do watch the signs and markings on the path, as it is not only a nuisance and danger to cycle elsewhere, you could also earn yourself a fine.||May 29, 2014
Hamish D||50||I knew of Hyde Park, obviously but had never been. On a cracking hot and sunny day it was a revelation in the centre of London. Walked through the park, past the Serpentine where families were gathered by a cafe and people snoozed on good old fashioned deck chairs (available to hire by the hour) and wild life in abundance to see, on through to Marble Arch and back to the busy-ness.||May 28, 2014
Viviennemb||50||Hyde Park is a place for people of all ages and abilities. There are runners, horse riders and walkers and Liberty carts for the less mobile. The bird life is varied. It is a treat to watch the many dogs. There are many benches to rest on and the Lido is great for a cuppa. In May, the roses are glorious.||May 28, 2014
yapw_13||30||This seem to be like a park for relaxation and strollers do enjoy with their family & pets during the day till late evening. Some parts of the park are accessible by car as a detour to other parts of the city. So it is not entirely a closed park. Was raining continuously on the day of my visit and we called it a day after an hour of waiting. Most of the hotels we stayed in London was situated nearby this park which requires some walking to be able to enjoy & witness it's hidden beauty.||May 27, 2014
JDNZ||50||After having been jostled and knocked about by pushy people at the changing of the guard, and leaving early just to get away from rude people, we wandered in to Hyde park and were totally enamoured with the squirrels. They are just the best, chasing each other around the lawns and up in to the trees and seemingly posing for photos. We meandered through gardens and open spaces and were almost able to forget we were in the middle of a hectic city. How lucky you Londoners are to have such beautiful spaces in your city.||May 27, 2014

It's just around the corner from Buckingham Palace and is easily accessible via tube to either Hyde Park Corner or Marble Arch. Speakers corner was buzzing when we were there and the park is well laid out for walkers cyclists and joggers. All seemed oblivious to the others which is always good as there was enough space on the paths for all to enjoy their individual pursuits. It's always nice to see green areas in big cities and Hyde Park definitely makes London more attractive. Well worth a visit away from the busy streets nearby||May 27, 2014

Chela B||50||Hyde Park, of the largest of 8 Capital parks, covers 350 acres of land. On a beautiful spring or summer day, experience its famous landmarks, take a walk along its meandering paths or sit alongside The Serpentine Lake. Breathe in the crisp clean air, have something to quench your thirst and remember to NOT feed the ducks. Meander awhile and let its charisma charm you.||May 25, 2014
TillyRambler||50||Hyde Park has many walking/running paths and little traffic, with only one road cutting through it. Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace abut the Park. We were walking through the Park and saw signs of the Princess Di Memorial Fountain, so we decided to see it. I was disappointed at first, as it is not a fountain, but a shallow, continuous, circular water course, with various angles of concrete to form the course. However, the more we sat there (with our feet in the fountain, of course), the more we realized that this is a wonderful attraction for families with young children. Grass all around and on the interior of the continuous course; perfect for picnicing. Water no more than 5" deep; ideal for children to play in. The continous concrete is a draw to kids to walk the entire course. Very engaging. I think Princess Di would be happy that this attracts families with young children. Enticing!||May 24, 2014

AmberGallagher||10||I took my fiance here for his birthday expecting this lovely place with market stalls selling great stuff but no. we booked our tickets which is highly recommended or you will wait in a queue out of the damn park! it was SO packed that we were moving like we were on a guided walk we could only move at 2 miles per hour due to the people which were pushing and shoving. the market stalls were boring and sold nothing interesting and not really christmas related it was all toot and not worth the money at all. the rides were awful and over priced, the food was expensive. it was dirty and full of alcohol cups and people shouting. the circus was dead boring and not worth the money either the only good part of the day was the ice cave which had some reasonably good ice sculptures but other than that don't even be bothered i wont be going back again.||May 21, 2014
Mike M||40||Beautiful tree lined streets and bike paths. The Serpentine offers swimming. I was there for a triathlon. Weather was cold and rainy. In London, go figure! lol. This is a great place for getting way from the urban areas for a walk or picnic. Definitely a place to go and collect your thoughts or go jogging or bike riding. Access by the Tube makes it convenient to get there from anywhere in London.||May 21, 2014
LivninCA||50||My absolute favorite gem in London! We live one block north of the vast green open space and love to sit, read, walk, listen, watch and breathe in this oasis! Our guests always love a brisk walk in the park after a long flight over to London --- helps a ton with the jet lag. There is always something in these acres to bring a smile to your face: children playing, dogs chasing each other, people visiting, and lots of wildlife being native in the middle of a large metropolitan city. Along with the natural settings, there are also many neat sites found in the park: Italian Fountains, Serpentine Lake and cafe, Princess Diana's Memorial Fountain, Kensington Palace, the Peter Pan statue, Speaker's Corner, etc etc. Enjoy, relax and breathe after a hectic day of traveling and sightseeing in the city! A MUST visit on any London visit!||May 21, 2014
Eddie020173||50||This park is one of the nicest parks in London there are plenty of people here sun bathing there is the bandstand which was blown up in 1982 ||May 20, 2014
Madipemi||50||If the weather is sunny dont miss the Park. Horses, fountains etc make a peacfull place to relax and chill||May 18, 2014
ian g||30||Great place so often you drive round it rarely through it the area is always busy and if you don't mind duck s...t avoiding kids on bikes and dogs it's ok ||May 18, 2014
Thomasfy||50||My personal highlight of my entire week in London was Hyde Park. We spent many afternoons just relaxing on the grass by the lake enjoying the beautiful weather and eating a great lunch, the local food vendors around Hyde Park sell great sandwiches and baguettes. The park is huge and its beautiful, the lake is full of beautiful swans and ducks and you can sometimes cross paths with a sneaky squirrel among the tress. The best thing to do in Hyde Park is to hire a bicycle and just ride around all the bike trails. Also the paddle boats in the lake make for some good afternoon fun. Its an amazing park which offers a relaxing break away from the busy bustling city. Absolutely head over heels with Hyde Park can not wait to bike ride around again in July.||May 18, 2014
Jazmin E||50||Go on a sunny (but chilly) day with a good book and a cosy jumper. Perfection. As central as it gets and even good for a nice afternoon of people-watching. You can't go to London without visiting Hyde Park.||May 18, 2014
tshep42||40||This park is huge, especially if you add in the Kensington Gardens, which backs onto Hyde Park and is separated by the Serpentine Lake, but is really one big park. There are a few monuments here, like the large statute of Achilles. You can also rent boats for a paddle on the Serpentine. It is not so much a destination in itself, but a nice place to relax, take a stroll or eat a picnic on a nice day. It borders the swanky neighbourhood of Mayfair and leads onto the ritzy shopping area along Oxford Street starting at the Marble Arch. If you are here, take a wonder over to see Kensington Palace, the childhood home of Queen Victoria, but probably better know these days as the post-divorce home of Princess Diana. ||May 17, 2014
Debs329||50||We had our first Hyde park visit late November and were amazed at the funfair and the Christmas market stalls. It was a winter wonderland with ice scating and loads of fun filled things to see and do. The park itself was amazing. We sat for a while people and dog watching. We also visited the princess Diana memorial fountain. A fab morning stroll with friends.||May 15, 2014
Paul H H||40||Admittedly the weather was good, but the park is well laid out with lots of points of interest to see as you leisurely take a stroll, or if you feel more energetic big enough to provide a reasonable jogging session.I was surprised to find escaped parakeets have taken to living there. ||May 13, 2014
The_Loup_Garou||40||I get to look down onto Hyde Park 2 - 3x per year, as we most often stay in a Park Lane Suite in the Hilton London Park Lane hotel. The expanse of greenery and water are inspiring.I usually do a walk, or two, through the park, and did so this time, as well.We were just before the peak of the Spring flowers, and the weather was doing its best to wash, or blow away what was there. It does appear that there are many new plantings around the park, and especially near Park Lane. Those appear to be mostly trees, and not annuals. This replanting was probably the only thing (other than the season and weather) that ﻿diminished my enjoyment.One has many venues in, and immediately adjacent to Hyde Park, and several full days could be devoted to experiencing it all. On this trip, I just walked and walked, and enjoyed the variety of sights.||May 12, 2014
girlpianotruckgirl||50||A stroll among the Serpentine has to be one of the most magical things a human can do! Surrounded by spectacular foliage of some of the most unusual and beautiful trees, shrubs and flowers. Gorgeous squirrels darting around playing with each other or seeking a tasty morsel from the tourists who rarely fail to give in to the squirrels blatant cuteness factor! birds, ducks, geese, herons, swans and all manner of beautiful bird-life make for this public stretch of London green one of my favourite places to walk in Europe. The best free entertainment money 'can't' buy!||May 11, 2014
Terry L||40||As nearly everyone has pointed out, this is a beautiful example of what a park should be, ie; it is well kept & maintained, the park trails go everywhere, the Princess Diana Memorial Foutain, the Prince Albert Hall, and at the western end is Kensington Palace where Diana once lived and at the eastern end, is Park Lane, where you can walk down to Buckingham Palace.This is absolutely a "must see" if you are ever in London, and on the weekends when the weather is nice, the kids are out in the Park, roller blading or roller skating to music, and there are some incredible skaters that can be seen there!Make no mistake, this is a huge park, and end-to-end is quite a hike, so if you are not prepared for a serious walk, do not attempt to walk to the far end ! There are a few shops along Bayswater Road (on the far north side of the Park) where you can find a cold drink on a hot day.Speaker's Corner is in the North-East corner of Hyde Park, where people have been coming to announce the end of the world for many years, but on a weekend, it is interesting to wander by and hear them go on about their pet peeves!If you are a walking family like we are, it is a nice stroll from Hyde Park back to the river, where you can see Big Ben and the Parliament Building. If you are not a fan of walking, there are London Tube stations at Knightsbridge and Hyde Park Corner, where you can reach any point in London. Buses traverse Kensington Road as well.||May 10, 2014
PhoebeNJ||40||Joggers, couples, children, families, friends, animals...this place is a slice of life in London on a spring day. Great way to relax and unwind without spending money. Perfect||May 9, 2014
Jo_Kok||40||I wanted to see Princess Diana's Memorial..... and it got us walking almost the whole park. it was relaxing and it is a place where you can do a lot of thinking. A lot of greens and it's a great place to bring children.||May 9, 2014
sirgaralad||50||Rolling Stones 1969, but no moss in this park 45 years on.How I love this park early morning, to see the sun rise over the London skyline, and the mist rising off the serpentine is a memory that will last a lifetime. Remember to take the camera.would love to recommend to all, but that would put at risk my next photoshoot.||May 9, 2014
Shady_Hagag||50||It is a lovely place. Beautiful gardens and nice simple playground for the kids that they love. I used to walk there daily with my kids during our visit to London after everyday's sightseeing trips. Enjoy it. ||May 9, 2014
Zuzka_Zemanova||40||Despite the heavy shower, which cought us in the middle of our exploring, I really enjoyed strolling through the Hyde Park. The green lawns, cheeky squirrels, fat pidgeons,...all od that just made the perfect chilly atmosphere which is furprising for a big city like London.||May 8, 2014
TerrywithaY||50||If you wish an alternative to the normal sights of London, Hyde Park is the obvious choice. A stroll through the plethora of paths opens up lovely vistas to the Serpentine, Princess Diana Gardens, Rotten Row and numerous statues. And who could not marvel at the flower studded lawns bordered by blue bells and roses !||May 8, 2014
lizziegolding||50||we walked though here many times on our trip to london, lovely place and quite large, lady di,s monument is worth seeing!||May 8, 2014
Cherie D||50||Went with my 15 year old daughter early on a lovely spring morning, was beautiful . . . very quiet and peaceful . . . would highly recommend going early, lots of squirrels and birds around.||May 7, 2014
22jessicas||40||Lovely park that is always packed with entertainment and little going ons! Based right at marble arch it is always very busy but don't let this put you off as it is an extremely large park and there is always a mixture of people such as teenagers, couples, families with children etc.Lovely place to just chill out by yourself or with friends. Closest stations are marble arch, oxford street and green street||May 7, 2014
PatyClaro||50||No words to describe such a beauty and delightful day. I used to live close to this park so during spring season it's just amazing, so clean and peaceful that you can spend at least a few hours walking around and checking all flowers, fountains and plants.If you are around you should check this park.||May 7, 2014
theawesomereviewer||50||Such a nice park in London. I just hate how they are charging £60 just for not cycling on the selected paths. This is annoying because they tell us to cycle on the paths are are constantly crowded by people. There are much nicer and quieter paths but you aren't allowed to ride your bike over there. Pathetic.||May 6, 2014
brilliantwash||50||Just walk or sit or lie down, own the space for a minute or an hour, find a magic flower or a cloud battle. Ice cream dreams or perfect art, horses for courses, a glimpse of a Royal.Just do it!||May 6, 2014
KiaOraKiwi||50||A lovely park to spend an afternoon... a sunny afternoon that is! The park is huge, you can go back time and time again and still find new areas to explore. The Serpentine lake in the middle is beautiful and it's always nice to take out a paddle boat or row boat to spend some time out on the water. There are some great picnic spots around the park for those hot days and nice restaurant areas too. The park is centrally located so you can walk to check out the surrounding sites of London too.||May 3, 2014
k3vinlim||30||It was a large and well kept park, with a very nice cafe next to the lake, great to spend a peaceful afternoon here. If you decided to take a swim, there is an area dedicated to swim. Worthwhile the visit.||May 3, 2014
scj13x||40||Nice big, well kept park/lake to walk around. A decent coffee shop that we did stop at, and a nice looking restaurant, which we didn't.It's not spectacular, or a must see, but it's a great place to escape the crowds.||May 2, 2014
rhodabow||50||Lovely for a stroll, easy to get turned around although there are maps and markers. Too early for much floral display but it was a wonderful stroll.||May 1, 2014
Ahmed A||50||Very beautiful greenery, very well taken care of, the lake is so beautiful and the restaurants overlooking the lake are really nice.||April 30, 2014
leigh_bartley||50||What a lovely park and so much to see. The Diana memorial was so beautiful and a lovely tribute to a lovely lady. The boating lake is lovely and plenty of seats to sit and take in the view||April 28, 2014
ysllovetravel||50||We visited the park on July, it is still cool in the morning, but it is fine as there are many stall selling hot drinks and sandwiches in the park. We hired the bicycle and cycling by the lake side for 30 mins, it is very good experience. We had lunch at the the Serpentine bar and kitchen, very nice and valuable.||April 27, 2014
Kimberly B||50||If the weather cooperates with you, take a blanket, a good book and a picnic lunch to Hyde Park. Work off everything you ate by strolling along the water, and get your fill of art by visiting the small but quite good Serpentine Gallery. The park is a nice spot for families with young children, too.||April 27, 2014
Sherlock1962||50||This is such a lovely place to spend a few hours, there are boats for rent on The Serpentine Lake and Barclay Bikes available. Also lots of areas to sit, I think I even saw a cafe. This will lead you to Kensington Gardens where Princess Diana's Memorial is located. On Sunday don't forget to visit Speakers Corner.||April 26, 2014
faringueri||50||Magic place! Giant park, good for a picnic, jogging, read a book. And there's a statue of peter pan that is really cool! Worth visiting.||April 24, 2014
Steve L||40||this is one of the best parks in London! and London is full of very nice parks. But this is special.. it's in the very centre, very well organised.. in one of the most famous and exclusive places of this wonderful city. Go there and relax a little!!!||April 23, 2014
JaneJP||50||This is one of the jewels of the city and if you are visiting sunny London, fortunately you couldn't avoid it even if you wanted to! Go there: play...lay around....buy an icecream....smell the flowers....walk your dog or pet someone else's....admire the statues and inhale the history of the magical place which will hit the "reset button" in your soul. Forget London, this is TRUE England.||April 21, 2014
LittleRachD||50||An excellently large place to walk, talk and explore. Beware of muggers on bikes, skateboards and roller blades checking out those of you who are not holding on to your bags securely. Saw a few people lose their valuables because of complacency. On a much brighter note this is a brilliant place to go on a warm, dry day. So much to see and do. Worth a visit.||April 20, 2014
RAK733||50||Indeed, A well maintained Park with plenty of tracks having various historical landmarks. Its not a typical attraction but its an amazing tour. I with my 2 friends took this walk to cross the park from our hotel located in Westminster area to Palace. It was drizzling but amazing. I liked it, the lake provides you so natural view with pigeons moving around you for food. The quite environment of the park adds in it beauty.||April 20, 2014
manunited45||50||Large parkland. Just magnificent. Beautiful gardens with lots of landmarks, history and things to see. Just relaxing. Nice restaurant and little lakes. Just a great area.||April 19, 2014
CLHH90||50||Well kept, adequate facilities, friendly people, excellent for picnics, tube right outside.If it's a sunny day, you can't not visit.Don't go expecting entertainment be provided for you. But watch the world go round and enjoy the quiet. ||April 18, 2014
nemagem||40||Lovely Park on Oxford street. there are chairs for rent for pretty cheap. Sit down and take a load off after all the shopping/walking on Oxford street.a nice place to sit and picnic and watch people go by. You can also ride your bikes, feed the multitude of pigeons that are a permanent fixture or simply take a nap.There are attendants who walk around taking the fees for the chairs and they will remind you when your time is up.||April 18, 2014
Aseem D||50||Luckily for us when we visit London we live right across from Hyde park on bayswater road. We have a 4 year old and a 21 month old boys. So this is sheer bliss for us , we just went to the Serpentine Lido to feed the ducks and geese. This is a beautiful spot in Hyde park since there's the lake and a cafe which is decently stocked. Though officially you're not allowed to feed the ducks but that's the only reason why scores of parents and children come their in the first place. They also have boating here so in case you're interestedI live in manhattan , ny and we have Central Park to boast of but I should admit that Hyde park has much better amenities and is really well maintained .Every 200 meters or so you have a small cafe with water and beverages and the public toilets are nicely spread out throughout the park ( something which Central Park need to learn)There's a speakers corner which is the best place for frustrated individuals to vent their energy. But I wouldn't care about it much , not a good spot for children. There's the princess Diana park which is really fun for the kids with a real looking sailing ship parked in a whole lot of sand. It's the best for over active boys like ours.They also have royal gun salutes on different occasions throughout the year but you should check the parks calendar for that. Truly amazingHyde park has different spots for different temperaments so when in London do spent walking a lot in this beautiful park and you will find your place||April 17, 2014
Dawn E||50||Lovely park,well located at the end of Oxford street. A free way to walk,enjoy the sun and chill.The lake is beautiful and plenty of different areas to explore and enjoy||April 16, 2014
SerenSmiles||50||We took a rest here in the middle of a busy London day. We watched the horses trot by, the inline skaters - skilled and wobbly, and enjoyed the sunshine. All followed by a quick nap on the well cut grass.||April 15, 2014
MAFoxer||50||Fresh air in the middle of the city... alongside Her Majesty's Regiment horses. London's equivalent to NYC Central Park. Best in the morning no matter the weather.||April 14, 2014
MontrealDreamers||50||One of my favorite place on earth, walking Hyde Park on a Sunday afternoon... you will never forget. Enjoy every second.||April 11, 2014
Oleg Y||50||Naturally by making everyday's promenade along the Bayswater Road, I never missed a chance to get in such sumptous vast green space.One of the largest parks in west London, it is bordered from the north by the Bayswater Road, from the east by the big avenue Park Lane, from the south by Kensington Road and leans on the west side, toward another beautiful green area, the Kensington Gardens with the Round Pond and Kensington Palace. Also famous here is the Speaker's Corner, close to the Marble Arch.Before, the Hyde Park was one entity with Kensington Gardens included within, but in 1728 has been technically separated from the Kensington area of the huge park.In total its overall area is 253 hectares.In the center of the Hyde Park stretches from the northwest to the southeast, the Long Water, a peaked pond.Beside the other events, that are held here in Park, we can also witness to the great Rock Festivals, Concerts, as were in the past the concert of the Rollingstones and Pink Floyd.I walked in the Park, especially enjoying the sight of the swans and ducks in the rippled water of the ponds and also the squirrels, swiftly running across the accurate maintained green lawns among the old trees, as sycamore, oak, birch and beech trees.||April 10, 2014
AhmadSyakir||50||Walking early in the morning at the Hyde Park was a great experience. The fresh air and scenery is mesmerizing. ||April 9, 2014
903tanias||50||We escaped the busy heat of London city and retreated to Hyde Park where we could relax on a deck chair for an ice cream, meal or just a cool beer I we so desired.||April 9, 2014
552LindaR||50||Visited Hyde Park during our stay in London. Truly amazing a huge park in London. We walked around and saw the serpentine lake and swans, ducks and squirrels. Nice little cafe overlooking the lake. The park I worth a visit.||April 7, 2014
Jonotics||50||Beautiful park. The art was different, but very interesting.Had to use the washroom at one point and discovered the closest one was 25-30 minute walk on the other end of the park.||April 7, 2014
Priiaa||50||One of the most beautiful parks in London....Lovely Lake.... Abound with swans , ducks and what have you..... An added plus...very very dog friendly ....cycling tracks throughout....boating in the lake possible ....an absolutely charming restaurant located right in the middle..||April 1, 2014
Glubetrutah||50||Like any great city, London has many parks. Hyde Park is by far the most visited though. And for good reason. In addition to being big and beautiful, there is something going on. Go to Speakers Corner on a sunday, where you can see people using their freedom of speech in a small corner of the park. That is worth a trip to Hyde Park alone, you never know what kind of thing you'll hear. Rose garden is also very nice. ||March 31, 2014
Stayzon||40||A massive park, beautifully laid out, with clearly defined paths (the main ones well lit at night). With the Serpentine Lake in the centre and loads of wildlife, huge beds of daffodils coming up everywhere and the trees just coming into leaf, the park was relaxing and peaceful. A great experience.||March 30, 2014
gardeningteacher8||50||We wish we had more time to really enjoy the park and had come later because we would love to go horseback riding, boating, biking and just relax. It is so beautiful with the flowers and green grass. My son loved the ducks and swans in the water. The park is bigger than expected. We even enjoyed just watching people roller blade in and out of cones in impressive ways. ||March 29, 2014
babarandceleste||40||Hyde Park is a good place for a leisurely walk, or a serious run. It offers something for all ages from good children's playgrounds to a "senior playgrounf" on the south side which encourages those over 50, though open to those over 15, to try a range of outdoor fitness equipment, and nearby there are bowls and mini golf. Hyde Park has a range of wildlife, herons, cormorants, swans, blackbirds and squirrels and is also a great place to exercise a dog. There are interesting trees and both wild and garden flowers. The Serpentine is good for boating, and if you are intrepid , for swimming. Hyde Park hosts various paying and free events throughout the year including concerts. Worth visiting on a Sunday is Speakers Corner , where anyone can stand up on a soapbox and declaim their political, religious or other beliefs.||March 28, 2014
Alkhujaf||40||what an amazing place for everyone to walk and run and even set and arrange your thoughts.it so large area that you need more time to explore it.||March 27, 2014
Leah W||40||Lovely to have a picnic in, long walks and to look a beautiful surroundings. Worth a visit if you're in London. ||March 27, 2014
Travel-Girl-Ange||50||If you want to take a stroll and relax, the parks are a great place to go. I walked through the Green Park, saw the Wellington Arch, and then walked through Hyde Park. It is quite big, and I would have gone back another afternoon if I'd had time.It is beautiful and relaxing.||March 27, 2014
JRN_NZ||30||On a nice day, this place is pretty cool. Speakers Corner is certainly interesting to say the least. Word of warning though - its a long way right around if you're walking it like I did. Cut across the bridge in the middle of the lake; its way shorter & shows the best parts of the park anyway.||March 25, 2014
StAuggie12||50||A great place to people watch and enjoy the wildlife and relax after a day of sighseeing. The flowers are amazing.||March 25, 2014
magicbear||50||This is such a wonder place to go and walk in the morning, right in the heart of a bustling city. Plenty of space to move around, flowers and fauna are splendid throughout spring and summer. The café beside the serpentine is wonderful and not too expensive.||March 24, 2014
Anna B||50||Spent a lovely morning in Hyde Park enjoying the sun and warm weather. The park is large and it's always fun to peoplewatch. Also enjoyed the looking at the wildlife (and the silly people that tried to pet a swan).||March 22, 2014
pip2013||40||We visited different sections of Hyde Park during our 10 days in London. It can be the breather you need, in between the hectic pace of life in the streets surrounding the park. We saw people feeding the swans at Serpentine Lake, squirrels and absolutely exquisite flower gardens. Even the stereotypical Englishman soaking up the sun with his shirt off, made an appearance. We were lucky enough to see the Horse guards ride by - alongside Rotten Row, but the one thing I wouldn't bother with again was 'Speakers Corner'. Much has been made of this in years gone by - but it was much overrated and gave me an uncomfortable feeling. During the few minutes we were there, I heard someone else mention that most of the 'Speakers' seemed to perhaps have a mental health issue. It did seem that way on the day we were there - wouldn't recommend it.Would definitely go to see the flower beds again - in the corner nearest Wellington Arch. Just beautiful......And the buildings the toilets are in are so cute!||March 18, 2014
Russell H||50||Hyde Park and Kensington palace are right next to each other and after the plane ride a walk through here getting our bearings on the lay of the city was perfect. The flowers gardens, fountains, sculptures and Prince Albert's memorial were immaculate and so much open space to run around and play catch.||March 17, 2014
Peter S||40||The park was busy with a children's football training competition, many people out for walks, joggers, runners cyclists and horse riders. Daffodils and various spring flowers were out, it was sunny, warm and very pleasant.||March 17, 2014
MrLew99||50||I love going to this park when i visit London. It's just so big and full of life, love going for walks there or just chilling by the Serpentine and watching life go by.||March 17, 2014
RemcoV533||40||Nice, central, clean and happy park in middle of London. enough lanes to jog and not to cross twice same lane(unless you run 15 mile plus). Nice hangout at the lake with food and drinks. When not just over for 1-2 days. Have a nice walk||March 12, 2014
gillead o||50||It was a wow experience to visit Hyde park during my trip in London and the scenery especially was unbelievably breathtaking. it is a nice park for a jog , walk or picnic as summer approaches.||March 11, 2014
H-G-Powell||50||Hyde Park is a great place to visit a patch of greenery in London and the chance to get a spell of relative quiet away from the hustle and bustle of the city.You can make of it what you want; either enjoy a nice walk around the park or have a picnic here (easy to acquire food with a sainburys on the north side of the park) or see some of the sites here of which there are more then you think. The park alone has fountains, statues and gardens to see but also there is the Princess Diana Memorial; The Albert Memorial; The Serpentine Art Gallery; and Kensington Palace. Potentially you could spend an afternoon or even a day just wondering the park.There are many ways to get to Hyde; there are no less then seven underground stations dotted around the sides of the park and buses pass by it frequently. If you are feeling adventurous, as we did, why not visit it on the Barclay Bikes and then use them to travel around the park at leisure? It would certainly fit in with the theme of the outdoors.||March 9, 2014
LadyOfLuckUK||40||If there is is one place I recommend you visit when strolling around the lovely big park it is the Italian Garden, they are the most lovely water fountains, in the past in the summer I have seen bands playing classical music and jazz. It is romantic and calming, where you can go and not be bashed into by a bike or kids on roller skates. The loos are really close and there is somewhere to by an over priced drink! My other favourite place is the Serpentine, loads of choice to buy over priced drinks and food, and make sure you take cash for the smaller snacks venue. You can also get a pedalo! Adults £10 and children £4! Great fun!||March 9, 2014
Nikos T||50||It's a great place to walk around. Also make sure you stop by and marvel at the Princess Diana Memorial.||March 6, 2014
Joanna G||50||Perfect for a romantic stroll, especially if the sun shines, as it did last Saturday. Plenty of space for everyone, and a really clean environment. We loved watching the squirrels scampering around.||March 4, 2014
Stephen T||40||Had a lovely afternoon in what is a vast and expansive park.Enjoyed a nice meal on the banks of the Serpentine at the cafe which serves delicious food and drink at a reasonable cost.Love to go back when the flowers are out and the trees are in leaf.||March 3, 2014
R-BIRMINGHAM||30||Come here most years on new years eve its a great atmosphere. This time we went in the ice kingdom as did'nt have time the previous year. I think its overpriced for whats inside took us all of 5 minutes to walk round. Some great ice sculptures though.||March 3, 2014
Mark L||50||I spent the day strolling and sitting in this picturesque paradise! I can't think of anything I want to do more than visit this serene setting once I return!||March 2, 2014
Asik4||50||Beautiful park, really huge, a lot of green around, peaceful place. You can do a lot of things there, I wanted to have such a place in my city. It amazed me and I hope to come back here soon.||March 2, 2014
Geckolover||40||Even in February this park is great to walk through. The blossom was starting to come out whilst we were there and we managed to catch a glimpse of the wild parakeets that fly around. Amazing! ||March 1, 2014
paul s||50||Once you entered the park you wouldn't think you were in the centre of our capital city, it is so peaceful. If you are a bird watcher (feathered) then you will be in you element. With the water fountains and the serpentine lake there is so much to sea and all free. We saw the Peter Pan statue and the Princess Diane memorial which is active from 10am. You could spend hours in there and not realise it. If you enter from Marble Arch end then look out for the large horses head statue, its absolutely beautiful.||February 27, 2014
Emma H||50||Had a lovely walk through and past the river. Very peaceful but a lovely atmosphere- people feeding the ducks, joggers, people on bikes etc. Well kept and clean. A haven in the city.||February 23, 2014
BigCityDreams-7||50||I love Hyde Park, especially on a lovely day. My last visit happened to be on a hot day last summer and it was such a good day! My only tip would be to take your own drinks cause them, along with snacks are expensive within the park. The boats are the best, you can rent them for either half and hour, or for a full hour. If you dont want to spend any money, Hyde Park is a great place for people watching, find a bench, or abit of grass - theres loads, and watch the day go by!||February 16, 2014
ralu_seby||40||Nice place to relax, well groomed, we saw a lot of people doing different sports. Went by Lady Di's fountain and relaxed for a short time and took pictures.||February 14, 2014
54BJC||50||Luckily it was hot n sunny when we last visited London....we ended most days sitting at the café on the serpentine having a drink and watching the sunset......even better watching all the people !!great park in a great city.||February 14, 2014
BradJill||40||Hyde Park is one of the largest parks in London and a nice place to spend time if you want to get off the main streets and find some peace and quiet. It is connected to the Kensington Gardens, which rest on the west side of the Serpentine and The Long Water, while Hyde Park can be found on the east and northeast side of these waters. Collectively, the two occupy 253 hectares (625 acres) of space in the heart of the city. Originally the property of Westminster Abbey, these grounds were acquired by Henry VIII in 1536 and were used as private hunting grounds for the Royals until Charles I opened the park to the general public a century later in 1637. Hyde Park was also the site of the Great Exhibition of 1851. During the summer, Hyde Park is a very nice place to visit. The kiosks and cafes are open, the Serpentine populated with leisurely boat riders and birdlife and many people enjoying this vast expanse of green space, a true escape from city life. Winter visits offer a similar experience. The green and lively environment are replaced with solitude, reduced crowds and opportunity for more quiet time, again providing an escape from the fast pace and occasional chaos of the city. We've always liked Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, preferring these grounds over Regent's Park, St. James Park and Green Park. Perhaps it is the presence of the Serpentine Lake or the vast scale of these contiguous parks, but they have long been our favourite in London.||February 13, 2014
Maud M||10||This was one of my favourite parks to go to, until all the CCTV cameras took over! A beautiful, gigantic park that intersects Bayswater, Marble Arch and a few more central attractions. Beauty at every corner! Great for cycling, walking about and through the many trees or by the river, having a picnic with friends in the open spaces, laying in the sun.. So many different views I usually used to get lost in there and see where I end up! Discovering a new space each time! I only hate the police being EVERYWHERE harassing young metropolitan/university kids having a smoke or a few drinks, along with all the CCTV cameras! and the super expensive food stalls! Gives less meaning to the idea of feeling free and relaxed and "away from it all" in a park really! All the beauty of Hyde Park got distorted by the marketing agenda the security measures taken to protect and serve the wealthy tourists! It's a shame...||February 9, 2014
camilla m||50||hyde park is the best park for all you londoners and visitors who want a fresh air, peace and exercise both the body and the mind , long streches and you can connect from kensington high street to green park station.||February 8, 2014
XaraAlexfoodlover||50||It was my best experience in London.I rented a bicycle and i drove it all around. It was amazing, all the natural beauty and the facilities all over the park.Full of life in the center of the city!!!||February 8, 2014
LuizDutraNeto||50||Everytime we visit London, we spare a morning or an afternoon to stroll lazily at Hyde Park. Every year London seems busier and more crowded: the amount of visitors is astonishing and the different languages heard at every corner impress anyone. Hyde Park is like a dream in this cosmopolitan London, a real peaceful haven! The Serpentine (river or lake?) with its swans, ducks and geese (bring them some bread and feed the birds!) is a pleasure for eyes and minds. Small boats are seen within its banks. The Serpentine Gallery and the recently opened Serpentine Sackler Gallery (designed by acclaimed iraqian born architect Zaha Hadid), situated on both sides of the Serpentine (river or lake, again), always bring something new and instigating, with free admission, at beautiful Kensington Gardens The Speaker's Corner is another London tradition. And, finally, the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain: a must see and a touching tribute to the People's Princess memory. Hyde Park, with its manicured lawns and scenic spots, is a major touristic attraction and shall not be missed on a visit to London. You'll love it! And be aware of cyclists, as they may be on your way. Enjoy!||February 6, 2014
Nicolas_Kar||40||If you have some time to spare in London, take a stroll in Hyde Park. See the speaker's corner (currently being renovated) and walk to Kensington Palace and the gardens. It's a great experience away from the hustle and bustle of the adjoining busy streets and their myriad of shops.||February 2, 2014
Karen B||40||You would never imagine that you were in the middle of the capital when you are in Hyde Park. It is tranquil, fresh and a lovely place to relax for any amount of time after a busy day. Just chill on the grass or rest your feet sitting by the serpentine watching the small boats on the water. Just be careful of the cyclists though, they ride on the paths and can be very rude and abusive if you do not have eyes in the back of your head. I shouldn't mark it down due to them, but it did ruin my visits.||February 2, 2014
Suzana D||50||I absolutely loved Hype Park, its so beautiful and the lake is huge filled with swans and ducks. We also got to get into winter wonderland which was also just as amazing, unfortunately we didn't have enough time to go on the rides, but definitely making time for it next year! ||February 1, 2014
Donna P||50||If your visiting London, Hyde Park is deff worth a visit! Lovely place and a must see! We visited on New Years Eve whilst they had the Winter Wonderland there and it was amazing, the ice kingdom was great! It is just a London must see.||February 1, 2014
BrunoDillen||50||Hyde Park is one of my favourite parts of London. I've always been drawn to water and a walk along The Serpentine never ceases to calm one down. And with a nice bar and an amazing art gallery, this is a great spot in London.||January 31, 2014
JujuBsb||50||It doesn´t matter the time of year, be it Winter, Spring, Summer or Autumn, Hyde Park is always one of London´s best bets. Whether it´s just a stroll through the park, listening in on one of the opinionated speakers on Speaker´s Corner, horse riding, playing tennis, taking in an exhibit at the Serpentine Gallery or simply sitting under a tree by the Serpentine and having a sandwich. There is no better place to forget the hustle and buslte of this busy metropolis and clear your head.||January 29, 2014
Lulu85715||50||I did not know much about Hyde Park except their Speakers' Corner before my visit. My hotel was 5 minutes walk from the park so I decided to visit. There is no speaker at the Speakers' Corner and I was told they' are usually there at weekends. Love Serpentine Lake and the water birds! Never feed a swan before. If you go, bring some bread with you. I went there again the next morning to walk/run. What a great experience! I love the park!||January 26, 2014
Jooaan||40||Wandering through Hyde Park in January you could be a million miles from the city! The lake was full of ducks, swans and geese. Parakeets were in the trees, we spotted Jays and numerous other birds.A good spot for a walk if you need a break from sightseeing or shopping!||January 26, 2014
Luci112||40||I liked the QuietnessViewsHow clean it wasThe Winter Wonderland attraction Disliked There wasn't anything to dislike really, but when I went I noticed that it was extremely busy for the winter wonderland attraction (too busy) at opening hours to be honest. Which might put some people off, but the huge crowds didn't affect my enjoyment. ||January 24, 2014
triptripexpert||50||Everything is expensive in London and being able to relax in a such a bful green area is great,,,there are many boats, ducks, people, trees, chestnuts...only be aware that depending on where you seat you have to pay - avoid lilos||January 20, 2014
Mairis C||50||if you like nature like me, it is a must. Hyde park is a huge park, so you can do biking, jogging, etc. You cal also cross it and soon you will be near London eye, buckinham palace, and a lot of attractions. I you go in christmas, winterland is a must. A lot of fun over there...||January 18, 2014
KeaHolidays||40||Its really nice to see so much nature in the centre of a 9+ million people city. You can have a relax time by having a coffee to the coffee place near the small lake , or you can have a picnic under the trees. You can do some jogging or bicycling. A must visit if you ever been to London||January 17, 2014
Valentyn K||50||I like such places, where you can feel how past meets present and somehow the future, too. It's a kind of very special atmosphere with unchanged for ages ground, and so modern people around.||January 16, 2014
Catherine D||50||One of my favorite things to do when in London is to talk long walks through Hyde Park especially first thing in the morning when everything smells fresh and clean and the ground is still wet from the frost or dew. I don't know how many things I have done this and I usually head for my favorite spots but always find something I hadn't seems before. It is truly a haven in the middle of bust London.Also if your preferred means of transport is walking is serves the purpose of a short cut between varying areas of London. For example if you are staying at South Kensington you can cut across the park and be at Oxford Street in 20-30 mins. Usually faster than the bus.||January 14, 2014
Jack_Da_Lad19||20||its not that British of me but I'm not a fan of Hyde Park. It is to me essentially a big open field with a few trees in it and an emotionless lake. St. James' Park is a proper park in London and the best - things are actually going on with Pelicans, Swans, water features bridges over the water etc. An active park.||January 13, 2014
ZhiLiangLow||40||A beautiful park with a largest man made lake in London , if you are in hurry or do not wish to walk then recommended to rent a bike.||January 11, 2014
Mmmidwesterner||40||I visited Hyde Park when the Winter Wonderland was there. It was packed with Londoners shopping, eating greasy bratwurst and sipping mulled wine and beer. It was very good fun - there was even a skating rink and carnival rides.I'm not sure if they do this every holiday season but check it out if they do. Entrance is free except for skating and the rides.||January 11, 2014
Sue S||50||This park, was just across from our hotel and when we had finished our breakfast overlooking the park. We thought we would have a stroll through it. This park was beautiful, the fountains, the gardens, the walkways - just the general outlay of this park was well looked after. The people who care for this, should be extremely proud. We spent around one and a half hours walking through this park, highly enjoyable.||January 10, 2014
GeorgiaGirl40||40||We visited Hyde Park on two occasions: one, while heading to tea at Kensington Palace. It was a very cold and rainy day, but the park was full of people and dogs. So many walking trails and some beautiful scenery. It's a fantastic oasis for the entire family. The second time we took our children to the Winter Wonderland. We left the carnival later in the evening in the dark - and had nothing to worry about. The paths were well-lit and people were everywhere. What a nice thing to have in your city. One word of warning: it's HUGE. Much bigger than you think! :)||January 9, 2014
sw11mike||50||A date for your 2014 diary: 9:00am, 25 December, The ideal way to get an appetite for Christmas lunch. Enjoy swimming in the open air in the centre of London with fellow swimmers and the occasional swan. You need to join the Serpentine Swimming Club first and complete qualifying swims during the year to qualify to enter the Peter Pan Cup. This year marked the 150th Anniversary of the Serpentine Swimming Club's Christmas morning handicap, swum over a 100 yard course. Spectators welcome too.||January 7, 2014
G S||50||We went during Christmas time, they had Winter Wonderland in one area of the park. It is fun for kids, but is too crowded and expensive for my taste. Children don't care about crowds.The gardens and the park are amazing, it's beautiful and clean and definitely worth a visit while visiting London.||January 6, 2014
Rose J||40||It's not my favourite park in London, but despite this I have been many times. In the summer it's most popular with teenagers and young adults sunbathing etc, as pleasant as it is I wouldn't recommend for young children, although the park has paddle boats for twos/fours to travel across the Serpentine river, which is fun. There is usually lots going on in Hyde Park throughout the year so check the Royal Parks website before going (http://www.royalparks.org.uk/), events include mini marathons, Winter wonderland - which is a great place to visit during late November, December and early January, and other memorial events. The park is good for all ages during winter months, and spring and autumn.||January 6, 2014
karenpammy2016||40||It is a good idea to combine your visit with the Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park if you are here. You actually can cross into both places without any true border separating either one. There is the famous Peter Pan statue that was made famous by JM Barrie who was the author of the story of "Peter Pan." It is located close to the location where the story took place when Peter took the boys out for the night. The Diana Memorial Fountain is also another nice place to stop. You can walk around the fountain that is made of granite with water flowing down in a circular pattern. There were people wading in the fountain as well. Guess they allow this in London. A great quite place to contemplate and enjoy the surroundings. Good to visit if you want a break from the busy, bustling part of London.||January 5, 2014
tomat449||50||A great park with a lot of possibilities of walking, running, biking or just have a picnic in the park. Good to relax a bit after walking in the hectic shopping streets.||January 5, 2014
Nikhil S||40||Hyde Park hosts winter wonderland in the winter and it was very pretty with the german market, but just too busy and overpriced. It cost me £10 to go on a ride that lasted less than 1 minute.||January 5, 2014
AstraIpswich||50||This is a really fun day out for young and old. It's free to get in, so doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg, though everything inside costs lots (eg. fairground rides, things on the stalls, food etc). You can take your own food and eat it under the cover of the Bavarian village. There's lots to see, including talking trees! We went to the circus and had a lot of fun. Beware of pester power - they take every opportunity to sell merchandise - they even sell champagne!Would be nice if you could get in more than one side, and if it was better signposted - we walked all the way round it looking for the entrance.||January 4, 2014
Noel K||40||Hyde Park was host to Winter Wonderland while we were there. This was a fantastic combination of German Christmas Market, carnival, and winter activities. It was extremely crowded, but the entry was fairly quick and free. There was shopping, tons of eating options, mulled wine at every turn. It was a really enjoyable way to spend an evening.||January 4, 2014
AgnieszkaGG||50||In December Hyde Park turns into Winter Wonderland, a huge Christmas market full of stalls with delicious food and snacks, mulled wine and christmas decorations. My favourite section is the Bavarian Village with fantastic choice of German food and live music. There is also an ice rink and plenty of rides. A brillinat place for a day out. Highly recommended!||January 4, 2014
Iswarayoga||50||This was my first time visiting Winter Wonderland, I found it really great when visiting in the evening. The event converted a much adored day park into a great fun amusement sites for couples and families. The rides are so vary for kids and the grown up. We only took the giant wheel and enjoyed it so much looking over London at night. Next, we were booked for Zippo Circus of their Cirque de Bersk show. Again, so much fun although feeling a bit too short for only a 50 mins show.You would also enjoy the German type Christmas market with hundreds of stalls of games, food, mulled wine and christmas accessories. Many are also enjoying the Ice Rink.If I ever in London again during Christmas, this will be on my top list to re-visit.||January 3, 2014
Amanda A||50||Hyde park was fun, its not too far off from the Buckingham Palace. lots of ducks and squirrels, make good photos!||January 3, 2014
Cassandra G||40||Apart from Winter Wonderland, the park is a lovely spot to walk through and enjoy being in London. It was even more beautiful in London with all the wilting trees, the cold and the rain! ||January 3, 2014
WaffleLover||50||Hot spiced wine, ice skating, wonderful for the holiday season! If you travel to London in Nov/Dec/Jan, it is worth a look. ||January 3, 2014
travelerdenise||40||Sometimes in a big city, you just need some green space and this is a huge one! Walk, sit, people-watch, visit the Gallery, have a picnic...enjoy it all.||January 3, 2014
TravelingEgr||50||Strolling through Hyde Park on any day is wonderful. Large grass and tree areas, nice paths, special gardens and occasional monuments. Also has great special events, generally far more publicly available than they would be in the states. We could hear a Bon Jovi concert just walking through (though I believe tickets were available for purchase). We also stumbled upon the Aston-Martin centenary. There were fenced-in areas, but you could still get very close without a pass.||January 3, 2014
VR747||40||It felt so good to go for a long stroll outside after the excesses of Christmas! This park is busy and Winter Wonderland attracts more people than usual but the Serpentine Galleries, the lake view and swan-watching were all very enjoyable.||January 3, 2014
Beckiedwards||50||We didn't see much as we got stuck in the carousel bar, had a great time people watching & dancing around Expensive but well worth it ||January 2, 2014
Celeste S||40||Atomsphere is good....great place for family night outing. Plenty of game , food stores and rides just that the ride is little too expensive.||January 2, 2014
alkeni||40||If you go to Hyde Park this time of year, it is a combination of "Disneyland", Christmas market, and a carnival with game booths. Admission is free, and it is really crowded especially at night. The lights make the whole park very festive and you can spend a lot of money. They feature handcraft items, lots of food, rides, entertainment, and carnival games. It truly is a winter wonderland.||January 2, 2014
Gwagtastic||40||Overall, my family of 2 adults and 2 teens had a lovely time. Glad it didn't rain! Just being surrounded by lots of different Nationalities, all having a nice time, was a real pleasure. The loo's were good! Lots of interesting sights to see and the ice skating was like 'You've Been Framed' live!! My daughter hasn't laughed so much in years - at the skaters of all ages and abilities. Nice to have a girl Singing / playing the guitar too.The mulled wine was lovely and the churros with melted white chocolate on were better than some I've had in Spain. I even found it funny that the 2 young women who were serving in the hit next to the Christmas rollercoaster were unintentionally hilarious in their utterly miserable service provision! My Husband was a bit alarmed when on sitting in one of the rollercoaster cars, it quickly became evident that he was too big for the seat. Realising the safety bar wouldn't go down adequately and his knees were almost under his chin, he indicated this to the ride attendant who responded with 'if you die, you die' before putting his thumb up and off he was sent to ride.... He survived!! We had a lovely time and will definitely go this Christmas too ||January 2, 2014
bethann1970||40||After reading many guide books about Hyde Park, my family and I went this summer while in London. Let's just say that the guide books didn't accurately portray the size of the park. We were already exhausted from having gone to visit the State Rooms at Buckingham and then walking from there to the park, so we were not up for a giant hike. The map we were looking at was not accurate, and we thought Kensington was about a mile from the entrance we used to the park. It was more like 3-4 miles. By the time we got to Kensington, we were so tired that we did not enjoy the palace at all, and did not even go through the gardens as planned. Either go to the park well-rested, or take your time and spend a day there. Or maybe even rent one of the bikes. Do NOT go there after another attraction.||January 2, 2014
Mahala C||50||Visited many times best in summer unless your going winter wonderland. Beautiful to walk or have a pick nik in the summer. ||January 2, 2014
CarolynCyr||50||We loved Hyde Park Winter Wonderland! The market is absolutely massive and the atmosphere is great! The whole place is very festive with lights everywhere and little wooden chalets. There is lots to see and do and eat. One downside is that it is absolutely packed with people – it’s almost overwhelming. We were there from about 5:30PM until 8:00PM – on our way out, there was a huge line up outside of the park. Admission is free, but I guess there were so many people that they had to limit the number of people allowed to enter at a time (so go early!). There is a huge amusement park as part of the winter wonderland – we didn’t go on any rides but had fun wandering around.The market is great, but you can tell it’s not very authentic. Most of the food stalls advertise “Belgian Waffles” or “German Sausage”, etc. – since we were going to be in both Belgium and Germany within the next week, we thought we would hold off on trying some of the foods until we’re actually in the right country! The same went for a lot of the items for sale – you could tell that most (not all!) were knockoffs and made in other places. Still, it was a fun experience!Our food recommendation is the “mini donuts”. If you go in through the main entrance of the market and walk all the way down, there will be a little food centre with a lot of pretty lights and a bunch of food stalls in a circle. One of these sells “mini donuts”, which really are just little pastry puffs with nutella and icing sugar – they were absolutely delicious and very original! We had the medium which was HUGE!||January 1, 2014
chappers8||30||We came back after a good time in 2012, and how it has grown! This place is huge this year! LOTS of stalls, big rides and ticketed attractions. Good artificial floor put down to prevent mud wading.Went on the Alpen Hotel - our fave from last year but it cost £5 for adults and £4 for kids over the age of zero. Great fun though but more pricey than last year.We didn't eat here this time although there was lots of choice as it is generally ripoff central.We skipped the Ice Kingdom this year but went to Zippos Circus which was ok - bit of a let down. Many of the acts were clearly amateurs in training and the MC himself lacked any charm or humour.||January 1, 2014
Howi58||40||Apparently Henry Vlll used to love this park. It's changed a bit since then, but you can see why he liked it. There's the Serpentine, where you can swim on Christmas Day. If that doesn't appeal, take a soapbox to Hyde Park Corner, hop on top and get talking. Henry Vlll won't be there, so you'll keep your head, but you might lose the argument!||December 31, 2013
francisfamily154||40||Visited yesterday 4 adults 2 teenagers very atmospheric . Teenagers went ice skating ( booked in Oct on line) . The ice rink looked like a lake due to all the standing water on it, but it didn't spoil their fun.. they all went on loads of rides, price ranging from 4 to 7 pounds !!!!! The food was also quite expensive. This is our second visit here all the way from Wales just for the day. And yes we will prob be back again next year.||December 31, 2013
Maz S||10||Sorry but, yes its laid out quite well I suppose and it was bigger than I expected which was nice. However a few of the stalls are repeated. Most of the items on the stalls was very expensive, I only saw a couple of bits fairly priced. Rides were so expensive! We are a family of four and it cost us £20 to go on 1 ride!!! It works out cheaper to go to Chessington World of adventures for the day and its got its own zoo! I went on 29/12/13 and I have to say some of the staff were so rude. We went on the Alpine Thriller in the morning and the guy sat there eating and drinking with a couple of friends in the booth. He slowly counted out our money and handed me over the tickets and he managed to do all that without looking or speaking to me the whole time! How Rude. My daughter wanted to go on the bobbing Reindeer ride and a rude lady shouted at my daughter "COME!" She's 4 for god sake!! We had paid to see the Magical Ice Kingdom, I stupidly expected to see lovely wonderful magical things but was surprised to see witches, trolls, a grim reaper and some very garish ice sculpts including stocks??, all I can say is strange...... oh and unless you want to go on the slide which you have to pull yourself down, then lets say you'll be done in about 5 minutes. We went for something to eat in the Bavarian food hall. We ordered sausage rolls chips and tea. The tea was vile, no exaggeration, the sausage was over cooked and dry and our chips were raw! We took the chips back and a rude lady threw the same chips back in the fryer with other chips and handed them back. I told her that I did not want them back and she asked "Do you want a refund"? Of course I replied. She handed me back my £9.00 and then took the same chips back and threw them in the fryer again?!!?!???! At no point did she appologise. To top our day off, we then managed to walk straight into a muslim march in their hundreds, my children were terrified!! I have to admit I couldn't wait to get out of there too! All in all, a disappointment, however I told my children it was fantastic in the hope they would remember it as a wonderful family day out. I will never go again!||December 31, 2013
nwmeredith||40||My advice to anyone would be to pre book on line in Early October for the ice skating, ice kingdom, big wheel and the circus. We arrived at the park Sunday 1st December at around 10.30am and got to see most things. By 2pm there was just too many people, and some of the walkways were just too crammed. The other rides are way too pricey at about £6 per person.But it worth going to just to tick off the list.||December 30, 2013
Ejthfj||10||The Christmas market stalls are a rip off but not only that everything there is a load of money pit! Te rides looked good and we were going to the ice kingdom when we found out it we had to wait for two hours! So we couldn't bother and we went to this house thing and it has rolling conveyers things you get at the airport to roll your suitcases out and our family was struggling to get up and I nearly hurt myself trying, so pointless! Waste of time and money! we wasted nearly over £100 trying to have a go at a stall and all the few kid rides and most of the three token rides only lasted about 30 seconds so people who would only like to waste money or is very wealthy go to winter wonderland! :) oh and there are a lot of smokers there so be careful for your young children!||December 30, 2013
karisgreene||50||Myself and my two daughters visited Winter Wonderland 29/12/13 we arrived just after it opened at 10am and loved it, looked round the many stalls, kids went on some rides, played some of the games and visited the ice kingdom which was absolutely fantastic, I was expecting it to be as good as it was, will definitely go again next year. We left soon after midday and by then it was packed, was glad we got there early as got to see a lot more without the crowds. Highly recommended.||December 30, 2013
joanie935||50||having just been to Berlin xmas markets all 3 major ones ,i have to say Hyde Park does it really really well amazing colour entertainment and food on offer something for everyone and clean too very authentic.||December 30, 2013
Thankss||30||very nice place to go and see loads of things to see the only trouble was we couldn't see much because the crowds but we gotta have some mulled wine in the german sausages but i'm still glad i went||December 30, 2013
holidayhoney65||50||I visited Winter Wonderland a week before Christmas with a Christmas loving friend and it was brilliant we came a way full of the Christmas spirit and I don't just mean the mulled wine!!! We mainly went to soak up the atmosphere and browse the Christmas market, the fair was a bit manic great for kids but not something we got involved in and we quickly scooted round that bit. I will definately go again next year, but this time spend more time listening to the bands and partaking of more of the mulled wine lol!! Great afternoon/evening out for all ages, yes its busy but the organisers do stagger people going in when it is busy to keep the flow of people moving which can cause a bit of a wait at the gate but worth it not to be crammed in in the market place and not being able to see anything. Highly recommend love, love, loved it.||December 30, 2013
Jayne W||50||Hyde park winter wonderland is amazing took my mum to London for her birthday and we had to take a look , if you are visiting London at Christmas it is a must , great atmosphere it really gets you in the mood for Christmas , great food to you must try the hot dogs washed down with a beer , we went at night which I think you get a better atmosphere , carnt wait until next year so we can go again.||December 30, 2013

In Christmas time donto forget to visit Winter - Wonderland a thematic park with Christmas attractions, souvenirs and drinks and food! ||December 30, 2013
Passthechat||30||It looks great,especially after dark,but is often overcrowded to the point of being hazardous.Underfoot is plastic walkway,and HUGE effort has no doubt been expended on this.Ditto the ride theming,I'm a fairground fan and I can assure you that most of then don't normally look like this!Cost of rides is a combo of the expense of visiting foreign attractions(but where else would you see them-and looking costs zip) retheming and the astronomical rents that are expected no doubt by the organizers!!!Bars are about on a par for london prices,but food trawls new lows for price/quality,and generally I'm afraid customer service.Avoid sweet stalls selling pick'n'mix at about 8x normal cost.So,eat b4 you go,take snacks,try to avoid w'ends,set a limit on rides and be cagey when you go on-ww express is great,kids love it and the showman has a great "feel"for pleasing his public-got a 6 MINUTE ride because there was no queue-and no,he's Dutch I think,so I don't work for him:)!||December 30, 2013

I had pre booked tickets online for the magical ice kingdom. The ice sculptures in the ice kingdom were beautiful. I had a professional photo taken on the ice sleigh. The ice kingdom is a sub-zero experience, to give an Arctic atmosphere; you therefore need to wrap up warm. There are many interesting market stalls selling sweets, cutlery, German snacks, Winter wear and Christmas gifts. There are lots of chips, burger, hotdog and drink stalls.There are many fun rides there and an ice skating rink. You could easily spend over £100 on a day trip here. Make sure you bring cash with you as the portable cash points do charge for withdrawal. People were also taking kids to the circus there. I spent 2 hours here. Winter Wonderland is well worth a visit!||December 30, 2013
CharlieFarguson||50||Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland is exactly what it says on the tin. If you want somewhere to go during the festive period to really enhance your Christmas and give you that warm feeling that only comes this time of year, then look no further. The rides and attractions make this venue a fun-filled day/night out for those of all ages. If you don't care much for the roller coasters, drop rides and fun houses, you can take time out to have a warm hot chocolate/mulled wine whilst watching the ice skaters (or take part in the ice skating yourself, as we did!). I highly recommend going and giving this place a look, whether it's you and your partner, family or small children, nobody will leave feeling as if something was missing. In short, Winter Wonderland encapsulates all things Christmas for you to experience at your leisure!||December 29, 2013
Departure809945||50||I didn't expect how the winter event in Hyde Park was really nice. I super recommend to go there if you have enough time in London.This like a time trip when we were kids.There are a lot of attractions which are amusement rides, roller-coasters, horror houses, free fall rides, mazes, an ice skate link, and a big ferries wheel, etc.etc. etc...Also, there are a big Christmas Market streets, a live hall, a lot of pubs, etc. etc. etc.....Please grab some food and alcohols and enjoy the atmosphere. The illuminations at night is more beautiful.There are a lot of bathrooms, ATMs, so you don't worry about the cash too.It's really really beautiful and nice in Winter. I love there so much.||December 29, 2013
mzm78||20||I took my 10 year old boy as he wanted to go again after going with his mum, the atmosphere is great and a good variety of stalls. However it extremely expensive. All the rides/attractions need 4-6 tokens at a pound a time, the rides are very short and a family of 4 could burn a £ 100 in ten minutes.Although the food and drink is varies, it is very pricey.I think it is aimed at overseas tourists as there did not seem to be many locals present, wont go again||December 29, 2013
andresloft||50||excellent place to laze... just spend at least half a day, with your family or loved one walking around or picnicking around this place...it's absolutely fantastic place to just be and see how london-ers are...||December 29, 2013
lynseysana||50||We go here every year when Winter Wonderland is on and we took a visit today. We booked the Magical Ice Kingdom in advance and it was stunning! It was fascinating to see sculptures made entirely out of ice and snow. Sculptures included a castle and a water well which were both impressive. Another favourite were the stocks made out of ice which you could put your head and arms in! At the end we got to go down an ice slide however we had to queue. Be warned though it is very cold in there so wrap up warm. For lunch we had Bratwurst in the Bavarian Village which was tasty and we had hot chocolate and two different flavours of churros, icing sugar and cinnamon sugar available to buy from a stall. There are also other goodies to buy including chocolate and toffee apples, fresh pretzels and pick n mix sweets. The stalls are really nice to look at and buy from and the atmosphere is amazing. All in all we had a wonderful time and will be returning next year.||December 29, 2013
Kirsty l||50||I went to the Winter Wonderland with my husband on the night of Christmas eve. The place had a amazing atmosphere, the stalls had beautiful things to look at and really brought the Christmas spirit to us.We did eat food at some of the stalls which was tasty and fun :) It was a great experience for us.||December 29, 2013
sharps1959||50||A huge funfair and Christmas market all with a Bavarian theme. We managed to keep our little girl entertained for hours at a cost of around £30, so I guess it could work out to be very expensive for those with large families!||December 28, 2013
fifafan94||40||Winter Wonderland is spectacular, but expensive!!! None the less, we visited to say we went. A walk through the wonderland will take no more than half hour if you are not going on rides, plenty of food and other activities though.The park is very large and open, very nice.||December 28, 2013
Fusspotfussypants||50||Booked online in advance of a trip to London. The ice rink was great. I thought it was well organised and staffed and great fun for all the family. A mixture of skaters, non skaters and first timers made for a really enjoyable time. To be given an hour on the ice I thought was plenty of time as someone who has only been ice skating a couple of times before, I was able to enjoy it and feel confident amongst a lovely bunch of people. The cheesy photo opportunity also made for a particularly memorable visit. Go ice skating but don't get swept along by all the other 'Winter Wonderland' tourist trail consumer stuff. Skating was such fun.||December 28, 2013
Hamzah H||50||This was a great place to visit at Christmas, simply for the atmosphere and all the commotion! And of course there's so much more, from all the rides and market stalls to the game stations and food outlets. It's easy to get lost as it winds around with so many wonders. I didn't go on any of the rides but it was nice to see them, especially with it all lit up so well at night time - which is definitely the time I'd recommend to go! It does get busy but it's quite big and in some places somewhat spaced out, and there's plenty of areas to sit and relax, including some stages with acts and bands performing which really made the night. There was even the ice rink for those willing and daring!||December 28, 2013
Haycroft7||30||Took the children Sunday before Christmas, good fun for them and the stalls where good but the rides are a rip off mostly 6 tokens a ride some up to 10. All the extras Ice Kingdom ,Ice Skating Circus sold out. Lots of food and drink stalls and overall a good Christmas experience if you are in London but would not come again especially.||December 28, 2013
Tugty||50||We come all the way to England from the US and this is likely all my kids will remember...It's just that good and that much fun!||December 28, 2013
jowatts12345||40||Our family had a wonderful trip to Winter Wonderland yesterday, it was full of Christmas cheer all round! I travelled with hubby and 3 young adults.The German village was particularly full of atmosphere with lots of things to see and do. The weather was very kind to us, however we were very grateful for the numerous places to sit and relax, where you can start to feel a little warm again! We were most nervous about the ice skating, but have to say this was the highlight for us all and so much fun, and probably the best value activity.I can understand the comments about it being pricey, especially if you are responsible to purchasing all refreshments, but plan ahead and take in all your left over goodies for munching on over a wonderful hot chocolate or a beer! We also went on the wheel, which was fun and interesting, the Ice Kingdom was not particularly brilliant and certainly not worth the entrance fee (can't remember what we paid, but any entrance fee, to me, was too much - very underwhelmed!).The place was kept nice and clean and tidy through the day, there were plentiful toilets, also kept clean - unlike when you come to Hyde Park for a concert!We also watched the cirque berserk, which was really good and finished off our day perfectly. All in all a very nice Christmassy event, which we all enjoyed.||December 27, 2013
townsend4||20||Visited In December. Travelled down from Worcestershire by train. Good points, easy to get to from train/Tube station., Bad points, Very expensive. Between £4 and £7 for smaller rides and up to £10 for bigger rides. 21/2 hr. queue to visit Santa. All other attractions sold out, so if you want to ice skate or visit the Ice Kingdom, book online before you go. £4.50 for a hot dog and £2.50 for a can of coke, rip off. Lots of stalls like a German market but all very much the same. Would I go again, probably not. Very smelly toilets and not enough of them considering the footfall.||December 27, 2013
ABEL C||50||Hyde Park was simply stunning. It was a huge park with much going on there. We stopped and ate at one of the restaurants near the lake and ate fish and chips. Nothing to brag about, but not bad at all. We spent several hours at the park, taking in the natural beauty and people watching.||December 27, 2013
Traveling_Man_1638||50||I was visiting London on business and looking for something interesting to do on my last evening in town. My driver recommended visiting the Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park. What a great suggestion! Lots of little stalls selling Christmas paraphernalia, rides for the kids, stands selling fresh grilled bratwurst, and even better, a plethora of bier gartens! If you are in London during the month of December, don't miss this fun event!||December 27, 2013
Dorothy s||30||We were in london and visited the winter wonderland. We didnt pay for any of the shows, or rides. Food is very expensive and not really that nice.the bavarian vilage is quite fun, with a german band et , but mostly full of young people, not really very family orientated. The rain didnt help and maybe it would have been more fun if it had snowed. Probably wouldn't return.||December 27, 2013
johanna c||40||Visited here Christmas Eve, great experience and got us all in the festive mood! We had booked the magical ice kingdom and ice skating, which you ave to pay for and would recommend booking before you visit. The ice kingdom was great, amazing work and the ice slide was fun! Very very cold, so wrap up! Our ice skating was cancelled presumably due to the bad weather the day before, which was disappointing. As with most events like this, food, drink and rides are expensive, so be prepared for that, especially if you're taking children. would recommend.||December 27, 2013
lecalabash||50||With out a doubt one of Europes top Christmas Markets. Friendly all round, great ambience, loads of great stalls and the best food we have experienced at any Christmas Market in Europe. Would like to see more British Food put on offer and less German food, as the UK has so much to offe on the Festive Culinary front. But, on a whole we as a family loved every moment in London and the market.||December 27, 2013
julesrann||30||This years Wonderland is good, we were lucky & went when it wasn't as busy, but as the evening came it did start to become busy & boisterous. The prices are the same across the site, which is good, but they are not cheap. The good thing is entry if free, so if it's just part of your visit to Hyde Park or London, it's nice and an experience It's an experience worth doing, more so when it is not too busy, but if you go when it is busy be prepared not to enjoy it as much & Beware of pick pockets & keep your wits about you||December 27, 2013
Sherrysherry7||50||I was extremely happy for the fact that this place has the winter wonderland event during Christmas and around. The food is of course a bit expensive but you can enjoy the sight of it. Worth it and definitely go. Don't spend a lot of money in this place like food but you can spend a little in drinks and stuff like that. ||December 26, 2013
Adrian H||10||So much money for each ride. The magical ice kingdom is full of trolls etc, not fit for a young family. Unbelievable con, especially for what you are charged. Don't be fooled by the glitz. 4 small hot chocolates for 14 quid. I could go on but suffice to say there Is so much more to do in a London than this tourism rip off. Seasons greetings!||December 25, 2013
JC-the-organiser||40||Visited as part of a two family trip with children aged 7-11. We had purchased Magical Ice Kingdom tickets in advance, just as well as no tickets available on the day for any pre-booked activity. Agree toilets are very smelly and you will need to queue. Xmas market stalls are ok but a bit repetitive as are the food and drink stalls. Food and drink was pretty good. The weather was wet when we went so no queue to get in but underfoot it was wet as the ground is not level. Lots of expensive rides for all. Magical ice kingdom was very good and the staff were very friendly. Kids loved the sculptures. Agree slide was not worth the 40 minute queue. They should have more slides or just one big one. Would I go next year...yes maybe on a frosty clear day and take lots of money!!||December 24, 2013
Saffire S||30||Don't bother going anywhere else except to experiences the German beer houses! We got there about 5pm. First boo boo was that we waited 25 mins to get in. You could get fast track if you paid more... Create a problem and sell the solution. Anyway, once we had entered the camp it was very over crowded and hard to move. The rain started pouring down so we run amok in it's advantage as the crowd dissipated for cover. The rides were OK, BUT, we were thirsty and made a pit stop for the beer house. It was huge!!! There were DJs, acts, togetherness and a great vibe. We had a 6 year old with us and even she enjoyed it. The food wasn't bad but I really begrudge paying £2.50 for a can of coke. The whole of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding Turned up and twerked their way around the fair.||December 24, 2013
ccfcway||50||Nearly didnt go after reading reviews on here.Was it busy, YES, but when we went 3pm - 7pm on Sunday 22nd Dec, they did everything right. Queued 1 min for tokens (£3 for a 3 min ride for the kids), no queue for food or drinks. Then went to Bavarian Village and spent a great 2 hours with a beer listening to the music. Fantastic, certainly be back next year !||December 23, 2013
Jazybaby84||50||Always a must at Christmas time, Winter Wonderland is a free entry attraction in Hyde Park, London and is worth a visit for families and couples alike. Fairground rides, German bars, stalls and ice sculptures are all on offer to get one and all in the Christmassy mood.||December 23, 2013
Punter1||20||Smelly toilets with massive queues. Food poor, far too expensive, far too cramped, noisy circus as roller coaster was right next to it, some very helpful staff, some very rude staff. Great for little kids with family. Could have gone abroad for a weekend and got some real culture. If you have money to burn, this is the place to go. Seven pounds per ride? Four pounds for kids? This event needs some competition. Rip off as an earlier commenter said?? Yes.||December 23, 2013
sallylamb||30||Visisted as two families Sunday before Christmas. It was very Christmassy with the stalls under the trees and lovely music and smells coming from the stalls. The rides were bigger than we thought. Sat at the Apres Bar and listened to some great live music. It is however very very expensive or maybe that's just London prices. The food and drink is on par with the Birmingham Christmas market. However for my hubby and 9 year old to go on one of the rollercoasters - the wild mause, it was £10! The swing ride was £7 pp. For a family of four this was impossible to afford. Other than the rides it was a great few hours. Lots of loos so no queuing except to get in through the entrance. Packed but a great atmosphere. Would defo go again next year but will save our pennies||December 23, 2013
Denise A||10||We visited winter wonderland on 22nd December with our children aged 3 and 5. It was an awful experience. Completely overcrowded to the point that it was dangerous, we decided to do what we had to do so that the children were not disappointed and then leave. We visited the magical ice kingdom (as we had already pre-booked this) which was actually quite enjoyable and then started to queue for the observation wheel. We soon gave up on this and left the attraction. We spent most of our time there shuffling along with the hordes of other people trying to get from one place to another. We couldn't even see the stalls or rides available through the mass of people. We didn't even get to see Father Christmas.It was a real shame that so many people were allowed into such a confined space. It could have been a really enjoyable experience had the number of people allowed into this small section of Hyde Park been better controlled. We will never visit again.||December 23, 2013
RaineP04||20||Too expensive, food not very nice, tacky market stalls, overate priced rides, dirty, loos disgusting, very pretty when it gets dark, which was about the only good thing I can find to say about it. Went into the ice kindom, but we didn't think that it was very good, just lots of ice monsters. Slide very disappointing. Maybe if they charged an entrance fee, things could be cleaner, cheaper and a lot cleaner!||December 23, 2013
V C||40||Really makes you feel Christmassy. Ice sculpture attraction is excellent and magical, the circus is very good with skillful acts and lots of ohhs and ahhs from the audience, children will love both these attractions. The wheel is great, good views etc. As others have said ensure you have plenty of money to take with you as food and rides are very expensive. However, if you bring a rucksack with your own drinks ( and budget for a treat for supper (loads to choose from, roasted chestnuts (£4 a bag!) hog roast, bbq hot dogs/burgers/Chinese/Indian/Italian/crepes/bratwurst etc) then you should be ok. There is no entry fee so I suppose this is made up for in the prices. Lots of mulled wines and ciders, Christmas songs, Santa Land, Christmas trees, great craft stalls with gift ideas etc.it really gets you in the Xmas zone. We spent about £60 on three of us on the night we went ( this is not counting £100 on online pre-booked attraction tickets) and we came away feeling it had been worth every penny and started our Christmas holiday with laughs and good times.||December 22, 2013
beeStaffordshire||50||6 of us went here during a london sightseeing break - yes the rides are overpriced but the atmosphere was lovely and put us all in the festive mood. It is free to get in so you can just have a wander through the park, take some nice photos, have a couple of beers and listen to Christmas songs whilst watching people skate as a family we totally enjoyed the experience.||December 22, 2013
8-HappyTraveller-8||40||We loved it as it gets you in the mood for Christmas! However, it's very expensive and totally packed full of people. We went on a Sunday morning ten minutes before it was due to open and people were already queuing! The first hour was okay to walk round but soon after this it was chaos and with too many people to enjoy all it has to offer. There is a variety of food options and many stalls to look at throughout the walk round. If are traveling there I would get off at Green Park and walk across as it only takes 5 minutes and the station closer is chaos! Later on in the day at the underground they were advising not to go as it was so busy they were turning people away. I think if you are going much later than 3pm then don't bother unless you want to que for hours on end! ||December 22, 2013
Debbie W||50||We arrived around 3pm on a week day and there were just enough people so there was an atmosphere but not packed. Lots of stalls selling Xmas goods, gift ideas, hats gloves and unusual items lovely strolling around looking at the items and some bargains to be had. Then went to Santa for free had to wait about 20 mins but as free did not bother us. They do take your picture which was really good but you do not have to buy and they were happy for us to take our own photos. Then to the ice world, which was incredible well worth the money only advise is to wrap up very very warm . Food and drink is expensive but there was a lot of choice. Lots of fair rides for kids of all ages, which cost not much more than at any other fair, but lots of choice so agree with the comment of giving the kids a set amount of money or it could be expensive. We then went on the big wheel for views over the park and the city, would recommend leaving this till dark. Very good baby changing facility's spacious easy to get into and were kept really warm We all enjoyed the day and will be back next year .||December 22, 2013
Tjmusic||40||Brought my daughter down to london hyde park winter wonderland as a treat before christmas, very magical and enjoyed the experience.....but.....certainly overpriced......you need to make sure that you arrive with a full wallet and be aware it will be empty by the time you leave, rides are priced between 5 and £8 per person. Thoroughly enjoyed the weekend but the prices took the edge of a bit.||December 22, 2013
CrystalPower||30||The main ingredient is ££ and make sure you give the children their own money before hand to waste. This is the 3rd year running at the land of overpriced and expense. But something magical for the kids to remember. Food or drinks is not by any means a cheap affair £4 for a bag of roasted chestnuts that you can get at the market for £1.50. The first year a relative purchased a bag of popcorn for £5, yes that’s £5. This year purchased them a large bag before hand in Tesco’s for £1.29. Left the booking of the Ice Kingdom and Ice Skating to the last minute (48 hours before) they were sold out. However, a member of the family went into the Ice Kingdom and was overwhelmed by the great ice sculptures, it does say -8 on the site but advised got too cold for the children. The rides are £4-£6 and is expensive depending on how many children you have in tow. It would be better to have a one payment for all the rides and the rides owners split the pot. The atmosphere is always enjoyable the decorations and lights are pretty. There is an array of food, drinks and sweets. There are some stalls selling candles, jumpers, hats, handmade jewellery, sweets, e.t.c. There is a lot of places selling large German sausages but they is other selections but would be nice if a stall sold a Christmas roast.There was a large beer tent and it had a stage, live music and lots of German beer from a beer stein priced at £9. Maybe it’s not suitable for the children but groups of adults were certainly enjoying themselves.The walk leaving the park felt much longer then arriving, but then again did walk to Hamleys. Arrived at Marble Arch station and walked down took about 20-25 minutes.Will properly visit again before it closes on the 5th January 2014, always worth the visit.The toilets were very impressive and really clean and warm.||December 21, 2013
LeilaniBlackburn||50||A must do to get you in the Christmas spirit, great for kids & adults alike. Very reasonable prices but depends on what you want to do. Myself and my partner had a look around the stalls for some prezzys then had mulled wine and food, everyone was very friendly & we felt very Christmassy after it. Loved it!||December 21, 2013
afamilyeasy2please||40||Decided on this as lapland uk was not affordable for us and it was free to enter. prebooked 3 for ice skating, 5 for ice kingdom/wheel at just iver £100.We went on Saturday 7th December. Fantastic weather so that helped!Arrived at marble arch at around 9.30am. Busy but not hectic (yet!) There was a big queue but not unexpected. We were lucky to have a booking for 11am for ice skating so we were allowed in a shorter queue. Got access by 10 to 10 and got a lovely personalised china tree decoration for £10 with all our names on it. We also bought some ride tickets for later.christmas music playing loudly all day and we loved it! Toilets were scattered around in many places and at this point in the day no queuing! Ice skating was amazing. Good quality skates and a magical rink! Didn't do the whole hour but very enjoyable. Did a couple of ride with no queuing and then had lunch. We all had "gourmet" burgers (beef, chicken or ostrich) which cost £25 for 5 of us. We thought this was reasonable in Lndon for the quality and taste of the burgers. Youngest had a helter skelter slide for £3 (3 tickets) but needed my husband to accompany him as he is only 3. We had to pay another £3 for him even though they used one mat and shared the ride which was a lot! However he loved it but it would of been better for him to be able to have 2 rides for that price! We had pre booked the ice kingdom so headed that way and did a couple more rides en route. The maze/crazy house was brilliant and excellent value at £4 each. It lasted a while and was so much fun. Would have liked to go on the ride next to the magical kingdom but it was £7 each (£35) for us all and the queue was horrific so opted out . Would have liked the opportunity to pre book this ride. Magical ice kingdom was lovely. The ice sculptures were brilliant and the castle amazing. It inspired us to google how it was made! Really need more information on entering though as was confusing......there was a queue for an iceslide at the top but no info about it. Most pele followed the queue out. A few too many people were let in at the same time so this marred the experience a little. The queue to get out by the slide lasted just over half an hour. So we spent almost an hour in -8degrees temperatures. The slide was manned by a disinterested and bored teen. There were people sticking coins on the ice which seemed very sad. Although it looked cool to see so many stuck to ice we were shocked that it was being allowed to happen. We bought hot chocolates when we came out as they had sold out inside. There was a huge difference in cost on stalls. Our cost £2.50 each with no cream or flake and resembled chocolate coloured water. Round the corner galaxy hot chops were only £2 each but they served the purpose of warming us up! It had got lots busier now and the ladies toilets were rammed. poop kiddies and pregnent ladies were crossing their legs or risking the wrath of anxious queing people to push in! We then had a horrendous queue for the wheel. Having pre booked we were shocked that we had to queue for an hour. It was only worth the queuing because we ended up on the wheel as the sun was setting. It was so pretty. However on reaching the top we could see how busy it had become. The place was scarringly rammed and to top it off there was a queue to marble arch around 8 people wide to get in! We decided being near to the exit that we would leave and eat at the train station. We were lucky we had access to a cab to Liverpool street or it could have been stressful! All in all we had such a lovely family time. So glad we pre booked as and when we did. And pleased we left when we did too! Would go back but may be not a weekend or just for a morning before shopping in Oxford Street. Very Christmassy enjoyable event but crowd control/security poor. Total cost for a family of 5 including train/underground, lunch, dinner, rides and keepsake/treats £250||December 21, 2013
ssouthall6||10||Having read the positive reviews on here I decided to take my children along to Winter Wonderland - wish I hadn't bothered, it was horrific.After a 4 hour journey we viewed the website which advised that families with small children should alight at Green Park and walk over. Whoever advised this should be given the firing squad, the walk took over 45 minutes and had my poor youngest struggling for breath. When we arrived it just went downhill....The initial walk is an array of stalls selling overpriced tat or food, but very few have even small seating areas for your little ones to have a rest and a bite to eat. Some stalls do but only the other side of the Bavarian Bar. With no real eating options for kids we ended up spending over £20 on giant hot dogs for 2 adults and 3 small children. A complete rip off.The ice kingdom and circus are to be fair about the only things that aren't ludicrously overpriced, but before you get to them you are greeted by hoards of rickety old fairground rides that cost between £3 and £4 and last around 90 seconds. The final straw was queuing to see Santa, and him buggering off home without an explanation leaving us and only us left in the queue.The place is tacky, overpriced and about as festive as toilet paper. Avoid like the plague.||December 20, 2013
Elisabeth M||40||I live in Milton Keynes and travel to London occasionally for work. I always try to book a room close to hyde park so I can go running in the morning. The park is a wonderful asset to the city and elevates london above cities like paris where one has to walk for an hour or so to see any greenery. The best way to see the park is to start near the Italian gardens, then around round pond and then back around the river and past the old police house. If its your first time to London, give it a try!||December 20, 2013
mumof2NearLondon||50||I took my two sons (13 & 11) on Monday and was expecting queues and hordes of people so was relieved when we arrived late morning and there was nothing of the sort. We were able to wander round and stop at the stalls on the way to the rides. Vouchers had to be puchased for the rides, no wait time, not one queue but £20 did not last long at £4-6 per person per ride. Good choice of food however a pork and crackling roll was £6.50 and a soft drink £2. We didn't book any of the special attractions as we'd done similar in the past. Yes it was expensive but we had read other reviews so were prepared. It was a great day out and we really enjoyed the experience.Handy hint: the ride vouchers are flimsy pieces of paper and have different values, check before handing over as ride assistants were not the most helpful and friendly.||December 20, 2013
jean f||30||I live in London and had never visited Winter Wonderland before. It's free to get into and then lots of stuff to spend your money on if you so choose. I would have loved to have taken my children there when they were younger. The singing snowman, the pirate and the Alpine hotel provided free amusement for small childrenThe food was disappointing and lacking variety. London now has an expanding market for good street food so no excuse for that. None of the food seemed to cater for children. I would advise any family to take in food for the children (if on holiday Boots lunch deals are cheap and easy and good and many other stores do similar deals). I'd then budget for about 4-5 rides (apparently £3 for adults, £2 for children). That would make a really cheap Christmas treat. I had a German sausage in a roll for £4.50- not bad. Tiny chips for £2.50-ripoff. Some of the food stalls seemed overpriced. Most were incredibly dull. I would recommend this for families as part of a day out. Go from there to Oxford Street. I would like to have said go and see Selfridge's magical Christmas windows but my inner child was very let down since today the magic of Christmas as I remembered it had been replaced with giant luxury products which were the main theme of the windows. And am I old and jaded...the Oxford Street lights are all white. What happened to the red, gold and glitter of my childhood??Maybe families should just keep walking till they get to Regent Street and Hamleys -toys, toys and more toys. What more could a child ask for||December 20, 2013

Dogs are frolicking in the green grass, monuments of sorts scattered all around, and the Kensington Palace - it's all worth the stroll and definitely so if you are a) with a pet, b) into running, or c) need to get out and enjoy some nature in a city that has building development abound.||December 20, 2013
MooMoo2007||40||I can't praise Winter Wonderland enough. I went there today (Friday) with my husband and our two young sons. It was cold but bright. We had expected crowds - it is the last Friday before Christmas - but it was comfortable. Entry into the park was easy. We arrived around 11.30am. Lots of brightly coloured stalls selling food and a lot of gifts. There was a short queue to buy tickets. We opted for the circus and the ferris wheel. We also bought 'tokens' to enable the boys to go on some of the rides.The circus show was about 50 minutes long. Very entertaining, good showmanship and my sceptical 3 year old was captivated. The ferris wheel was a bit draughty and cold - the doors are not sealed shut as they are on the London Eye, but we appreciated the view across the Park and over London.There are so many stalls selling food we didn't know where to start. We opted for a burger each which was cooked freshly. It's not cheap, but you can't go into an attraction like this and expect it to be reasonably priced. The rides were a good mix of family - little train, low aeroplanes, carousel - and the thrill seeking. We left around 4pm as it was getting dark and cold and the boys were flagging. If they were older I wouldn't have minded staying later. This was good fun, not overcrowded and lots to entertain the whole family. I think we were fortunate with the timing of our visit, I've heard it gets very busy at the weekend. Plan ahead!||December 20, 2013
Goody H||30||I took my daughter and her friends for a Xmas treat. We arrived at 3pm and it was quiet and a beautiful day. I had booked the observation wheel, Ice Kingdom and evening circus thank goodness!. The set up was much the same as last year. My biggest criticism is how expensive the rides and food are. I spent £50 on ride tokens and this paid for 4 rides which quite frankly are very average. Add this to the cost of the other attractions I had already paid for and this makes for an expensive trip which I don't mind if it is worth it. The Ice Kingdom is good but very very cold, we went to one of these in America and they issue you with survival suits! Thankfully it was a mild day and we managed to warm up quite quickly. If you go on a cold day, I would suggest you leave this to the end. The Observation wheel was fine, You went around twice; only downside was the half an hour wait and this was at a quiet time. The circus was good and a great end to the day. The kids loved it and it is worth a visit for that reason but the other reviews regarding the crowds are true. By the end of the day it was extremely busy. We won't be going next year.||December 19, 2013
AyseI228||50||Loved it!! We were there today and we all loved it. Yes, it's expensive, but I'm sure you can dig deep once a year! Seeing my sons excitement made it worth every penny. I am annoyed at a lot of the reviews we read before going that insinuate there is nothing to eat there but German sausage and potato. We paid a fortune eating out before going as we were worried we wouldn't find anything we liked but they had everything! Burgers, pizzas, chips, pies, panini, BBQ grills.... The list goes on! The children's rides were great, especially Santa's sleigh and the candy cane bungee and the atmosphere was buzzing. We were there between 1-4pm and it wasn't any where near as crowded as we were expecting, and today's blazing sunshine certainly helped make it a fab afternoon. So festive and full of crafty bits - we would go again if we could||December 19, 2013
tbk718||50||We visited London in late December. My children absolutely loved visiting Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. There are amusement park rides, games, food and shops. Pretty expensive but a real treat with all the carnival lights and festive atmosphere.||December 19, 2013
Gajarajan1947||40||For a long time we had been reading about this Hyde Park and its speaker's corner. So we made it a point to visit this historic Park. We reached Marble Arch Underground Railway station and started to walk towards the Park. It gave a wonderful feeling to sit in those benches around the Speaker's Corner and visualise those great speakers who vented out their mind from there. It is a vast lawn area of green carpet where we found people having their leisurely walk and children playing. This is yet another landmark of London one must never fail to visit.||December 18, 2013
knitandc||50||As part of a tour orgainised by National Holidays we went to visit Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. The atmosphere was very friendly and people were wishing 'Happy Christmas' as we walked along.The stalls, events and attractions were great and as the evening drew on the lights were lovely - it is an attraction to suit both young and old and those inbetween too.||December 18, 2013
amie c||30||Tourist Trap....First of all this is not a cheap day out. Here are the average prices: £6 for a burger, £4 for a beer, £4 for a small cup of mulled wine, £6 to £8 per ride (there are several) and about £3.50 for sweet stuff. The money will really add up and this isn't even including the market stalls, which were shockingly over priced, not only that but I really didn't find the markets had that much to offer, there were about 3 christmas ornament shops - I expected there to be more of these seeing as this was a Christmas fair, the rest were handmade tat that probably weren't worth the prices being charged. Nothing special, and quite repetitive with all the bavarian beer places, sausage places and stalls, however there was a pleasant atmosphere, good rides and visually it was really nice. I just think it was a little overrated, I was hoping it would be something more traditional, but instead it was a cross between black bush market and thorpe park. Don't think I will visit again to be honest, but i really recommend this for families who have the cash to treat their kids to a fun day out. Good thing is that it is free to enter. Bathroom facilities were very unpleasant.||December 17, 2013
Gaiaroo||40||After reading the reviews and getting pre-warned of "90 minute queues" to get in, we decided to see for ourselves. We took the advise on all the billboards and got off at Marble Arch. Very well sign-posted with guides helping direct people and even 4 people on the crossings enduring no accidents. We walked straight into the park with no trouble or queues. Busy but not packed and we looked at the stalls with ease. We found somewhere to have a drink but weren't surprised by the prices (£4.50 a pint). Be pre-warned it is muddy so wear sensible shoes / trousers as it did rain whilst we were there.Went on the Ferris Wheel £8 each but was a lovely view and the queue wasn't too bad. By the time we left at 08.30pm on Sunday night it was very quiet and was a lovely atmosphere.Would recommend but be prepared for the ride / drink prices !!! ||December 17, 2013
Ellabella208||30||We visited on 15 December at about 3.30. We loved the atmosphere, the lights and the Christmassy smells of mulled wine and cinnamon. There were quite a few rides varying from sedate rides for the younger children to more scary rides for the older (braver!) ones. The ice rink was more like a lake and I agree with the earlier comment that trunks would have been more appropriate than skates. There were lots of food and drink stalls. The markets were interesting although some of the stalls were a bit samey. The ice sculpture bit was fully booked so we booked to visit that the following morning. The place was heaving when we arrived but when we left, about 6 you could hardly move and there were droves of people pouring in. Entry to Wonderland is free and whilst the food/drink and attractions are pricey you can choose to spend as much or as little as you want. When we returned the next morning, at 10 when it opened, for the ice sculpture it was much calmer. You could actually see everything there was to see and it was much better - I would recommend visiting at this time. As to the ice sculpture, it took us about 15 mins to walk round. The sculptures were good but so not worth the entrance fee. We visited a similar exhibition In Bruges a couple of years ago, about half the price and streets ahead in terms of content, value and wow factor.||December 17, 2013
Xphile1067||20||Cute market to begin with, with festive booths and decorations, selling all sorts of wares. After that bit, it turns into a fun fair, with some interesting looking rides, but they were quite expensive. Each ride required a certain amount of tokens, and each token was £1 each. The food smelled great, but also a little pricey, so we ate at a pub nearby. Nice day out, though, and a great way to stroll through part of Hyde Park.||December 17, 2013
LJCrozzo||40||Myself and my fiancée visited on Saturday 15th December. We visit Winter Wonderland every year but think this will be the last time we go on a Saturday. We got there about 5ish and the queue’s were already massive! This is the first year we have every had to queue, so we walked around to the Marble Arch entrance which was a little shorter than the Main entrance at Hyde Park corner. We queued for about an hour before we got in, with the stewards letting some people in every 15mins. When we got in it was absolutely packed so don’t expect to get anything done in there in a rush! However we were quite happy to take it slow and work our way round the park. We went on a few rides, got some hot waffle and some mulled wine and played some carnival games. I would definitely recommend the JagerBomb Slush Puppies from ‘The Christmas Bar’ by the Hyde Park corner entrance, they were very good! If you don’t mind the crowds and the weather is nice then its definitely something to do over the festive period!||December 17, 2013
UckfieldSue||40||We visited Winter Wonderland on the first Wednesday of December. We didn't have any expectations at all and it was an add-on to a day out in London. We loved it! Fantastic atmosphere, picked up some beautiful Christmas tree decorations (from different stalls). Plenty of rides. Loads of food and drink stalls but much of it is very expensive. I would advise not to buy at the first available opportunity, as the prices seemed to drop later on. We went into the ice kingdom. Liked the sculptures and we got plenty of opportunities for photos in santa's sleigh, in the stocks etc. Very expensive for £9 per person and I wouldn't want to pay that, when it is crowded. Would definitely go back! Not at the weekend though, as not a fan of big crowds.||December 16, 2013
lizaengland||40||Visited on Sunday 15th December and arrived about 15 mins before opening. In the morning it was comfortable to look around at the christmas stalls and attactions, prices was quite high as when in London you will pay London prices!!!! Left just after lunch to go elsewhere and went back when it was getting dark so about 4:00 and it was heaving with people, when i'm afraid we got pushed and shoved. Anyway back to Winter Wonderland at night very pretty with all the christmas lights. There are portable toilets, and plastic safely placed down so your not walking on the grass. Plenty of eating/drinking places. This is a well organised event and alot of work put into it!!!!!! Would recommend to visit it is so nice. You have a choice to spend money so can be as expensive as you make it!||December 16, 2013
Felicia L||40||Was glad that we manage to catch this event whilst in town! And that we got the first row since we were early (crowds were still at Buckingham Palace for the Guards changing ceremony).Even without any special event, do drop by for some picnicking or just simply lay on the grass and relax :)||December 16, 2013
Trebor892||20||I went on Sunday 15th December .having been last year but not took part in the skating we decided to book skating for this year so with tickets booked we made are way to hyde park. .on arrival nothing seemed much different so we made are way to skate and was meet with a view of water on the ice but not a little water ,a lake!!!! When I asked a manager would this water be sucked by the ice machine his reply was"it is a outdoor activity. You expect this!!!"..for £42 a family I expect a ice rink..id of been better bringing my trunks. Total let down .wont b back ||December 16, 2013
Rebecca T||20||I'd booked our tickets for the attractions so we were fast tracked at the entrance and then walked through the lovely row of market stalls...that is where the 'Wonderland' stopped I'm afraid. It was so packed it surely can't be safe and all there seemed to be were fair rides and food stalls. The value for money for the individual attractions I'd paid for was fine but overall it was so disappointing, would not visit again & can't recommend it to anyone I'm afraid.||December 15, 2013
LPLawJones||50||WAW...AMAZING...SPECTACULARMy boyfriend and I went to Hyde Park Winter Wonderland last Wednesday night (11th Dec 2013) and we just had the best time.It was so Christmasy....it was like another world.Everyone was in great spirits.Wide range of rides...not over pricedIce rink was great fun and lasted a good hour - good queuing system so you weren't hanging around for ages! They also had secure locker service for your bags etc.The big wheel was great.There was plenty of choice for food and drink.Plenty of clean toilets jotted aroundCash machines on sightIf you like Christmas then this Winter Wonderland is a MUSTKnocks socks off all the others I've visited Great for couples - friends - familiesI will definitely be returning||December 15, 2013
52Anne||10||I can't believe that anyone is giving Winter Wonderland anything over one star. It was the first time we had visited, and it will certainly be our last. We went on Monday 2 December at around 6:30 PM. We didn't have very young children with us, but we had 4 between the ages of 8 and 14, but even then we were concerned for their safety. It was nothing like we had imagined, and the wonderful images we had seen on the internet, were worlds apart from the reality. My daughter had a mulled wine on the way into the park, to get into the spirit of things, but she threw it away, It wasn't warm, it was BOILING. That was £4.50 down the drain, in a flash. We walked around for about 15 minutes. This wasn't enjoyment. It was a nightmare. We left the sausages, big frying pans and boiling mulled wine, and left the park, never to return to another Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park.||December 15, 2013
NTFB||40||The Ice Kingdom was the highlight for us. We arrived in the late morning and the place was filling up by the minute. By the time that we left, at around 3:45pm the hoards were streaming in. We enjoyed our visit but the crouds would be very difficult with young children later in the day/evening.||December 15, 2013
SafariGirl100||20||We arrived around 1100 and walked straight in. Tubes to hyde park station were fine and it was calm and easy to get around. We were able to sit down and eat in one of the bavarian village hot dog cafes and the hot dog was great (£4.50 though so not cheap).Fast forward to 2pm and it was considerably more busy! People were queuing a long way back and i was told if i exited the event i would not get back in.All attractions were sold out (circus, ice skating, etc)I didnt like the look of the ice skating..... The rink was so wet.... People were falling and getting soaked! By 4pm it was HEAVING and by 6pm as we left the queue was horrendous and the park was rammed. I would not bring children at night. There were also massive queues to buy tokens (most rides cost £4-6) pp! The fairground stalls all cost £3 and people rarely seemed to win.There is a cash machine but since nowhere takes cards bring cash.Beers are £4-5.The market is ok but the one under the london eye is much better and there are rides there and much better food stalls there too.Our group enjoyed the circus.The magical ice kingdom was a bit boring and kids didnt like it.Big wheel was ok but FREEZINg as doors didnt shut right and the floor is meshed. There was also a massive queue.Overall the kids liked it and i was better than 2 yrs ago but we wish we left earlier..... Had to walk to the further tube stations, it was so busy they shut the stations.I would question the safety of this event if a stampede or situation occurred as you are trapped inside and its relatively narrow and unorganised.I wouldnt bother going again. Hellishly expensive and busy. Better places elsewhere in london.||December 15, 2013
Alisonabel||50||We has a fantastic day at winter wonderland. Lots to see and do for everyone of all ages. Ice kingdom was amazing however was unbelievably cold. It's advisable to weather hat, gloves and scarf. Beautiful stalls selling lots of gifts. Excellent range of rides for all ages. Fun day had by all! Only downside was it was quite expensive.||December 14, 2013
Debbyb70||40||I had previously visited 2 years ago. The rides are bigger and so is the Christmas market.Prices range from £3 for a toddlers ride to £8 for the biggest ride. Beware kids ride fares finish at age 12, my daughter is 12 and kept getting asked her age. The rides she went on were all £4, and they all lasted a good while. Her favourites were the alpine hotel, ice mountain, and the waltzer.Think there is more food and drinks places than rides there.Also, floor is covered in heavy duty plastic, so at least you are not walking in mud.||December 14, 2013
Danielle L||10||We have just visited Winter Wonderland for the 3rd year running after having enjoyed our previous visits, however this year was a terrible experience and we will not be returning! The queue to enter was over an hour long luckily we had pre booked tickets for the ice kingdom (which was a complete waste of money) so we were able to jump the queue and gain entry, once in winter wonderland it was dangerously over crowed and all we could do was walk in the directional flow of people, being constantly pushed and shoved. Food & drink was again overpriced but it is London and expect nothing different. We made our way to the ice kingdom after only being in the park for 1 1 hour as couldn't stand the over crowing anymore, and was then hit with further disappointment on entering the kingdom, what we envisaged ( a magical ice kingdom all bright & white with lots of twinkling lights and snow machines) was nothing more than a huge black marquee with some ice sculptures of animals, ogres & witches and lots of undressed christmas trees just plonked amongst the sculptures, a complete rip off at £9 each and on leaving the ice kingdom we decided to make a quick exit from the whole place never to return again!!! Another example of something getting too big and becoming unmanageable, dangerous, and a complete rip off!||December 14, 2013
ElleForder||50||An amazing festive day out - free entry meant the crowds kept flowing all day long. Fair ground rides, craft for sale and food and drink of all kinds. Brilliant day out for all ages!||December 14, 2013
Roger A||40||Having read a number of different reviews for this venue we nearly decided not to go for fear of being crushed, trampled under foot and over charged for everything. We arrived approx noon on Friday 6th December and walked from Green Park tube station. There were a few people heading in the same direction but it was a pleasant walk to Hyde Park. There is no entrance fee so you could walk round all day from 10am to 10pm and not spend any money and just enjoy the fantastic atmosphere. There are plenty of Christmas stalls which do repeat but come on how many different options of Christmas novelties are there. If you fancied something to eat the choice was pretty good but not if you expect everything for free. We couldn't resist trying the Bratwursts cooked to perfection on one of the many barbecue grills and to be honest £4.50 was well spent. Also later in the day the Angus beefburgers were to die for all washed down with choice of drink. If you don't want to spend your hard earned cash then don't buy anything, bring your own picnic and use one of the many benches. We did book the ice kingdom and ok it was expensive but great to look at the fantastic models carved from blocks of solid ice, what an amazing skill.We also booked to see the evening circus show and was not disappointed. Look out for the amazing high wire act, gosh. As the light began to fade in the park the thousands of coloured lights really stood out and gave a marvellous display and more of an atmosphere. The fun fare, although not our scene was exiting to stand and watch hundreds of people enjoying themselves. Don't criticise the price of everything, because everybody has to earn a living to survive and bear in mind this is London, a major city of the world. Try staying in Venice!!! The park did get more crowded as the evening approached but this was only to be expected with the many people having finished work and now looking for a good time. We will visit again and a word for the organisers make the main entrance thoroufares slightly wider.||December 14, 2013
CathyMoseley||40||Busy and crowded but a variety of stalls, sort of craft German theme, and plenty of eating choices and drinks. struggled to find tea but a 'security' tipped me off that a bar in the BArvarian Village sold teas and coffee. the stall with the bog sausages also sold reasonable chips for £2.50, so sat lietening to live music etc, jolly atmosphere family friendly. Free to enter and walk around. There are toilets in portable cabins. Very handy for buses. We did go on a Wednesday, not too crowded.Didn't buy the tokens for the fair, skating circus etc so can't comment on those apart from the price seemed a lot!||December 14, 2013
Mahmoud H||40||went there as a group of 3 guys the place was packed with tourists ( and the usual tourist predator "the pickpockets" just look sharp and theyll leave you alone ) lots of food stalls ( fish and chips ham ribs ... all the good stuff )theres a nice club inside called aspen or something like that and a great hall with a stage ( LOADS of ppl inside with a great festive atmosphere you can have a pint of beer in a glass mug for 9 pounds and 5 deposit )we didnt go on any rides as they were really over priced allnall a fun experince for drinking and eating out with a bit of dancing and mingling||December 13, 2013
Windy54_09||30||We enjoyed a sunny winter afternoon's walk through Hyde Park to check out Winter Wonderland. Not too crowded and we wandered among the stalls with ease. Enjoyed watching the ice skaters, beginners and all. ||December 13, 2013
SapphireRose88||30||I've been going to the Hyde Park Xmas market for the last 5 years, and enjoyed every year. This year, apparently the organisers have changed the rules and they've now erected Barricades all along the perimeter of the Park which meant people are no longer free to exit / enterwherever they like. Because there are now are now limited entrances and exits, there was an enormous queue of people stretching right back to Green Park station, all wanting to get into the Park. It was utter Chaos and babies were screaming, people were confused and frustrated and everyone was just basically squashed. They only allowed a certain number of people to enter each time so the queue kept getting longer. It was such an unpleasant experience!!! The Police guarding the vicinity told everyone that it would be a minimum 2 hour wait to get in. (Unless you have already bought advance tickets to the ice Skating rink, Ferries wheel etc, then you get to cut the queue). Once you were in, there were many shops, which were nice. This year there was a large indoor tent where there was a stage with bands / singers and loads more drink stalls. The usual thing, just magnified by about 5 times as compared to last years I believe. But there were just too many people in there. I believe because of the barricades, it makes it impossible for people to enter again once you've exited, so people are reluctant to exit the market, making it terribly crowded in there. I went on a weekend, so maybe if you want to keep your sanity, go on a weekday!||December 13, 2013
KATE D||50||Hyde Park is just AMAZING! To find such a beautiful space in the middle of a City in the UK is really quite a treat! There is something for everyone, whether you wish to wander through the gardens, soak up some of the local history, exercise until you are red in the face or simply sit and watch the World go by. In the Summer it is a bustling, vibrant sea of individuals and groups, families, tourists and locals. In the Autumn it is a sea of beatiful colours, fantastic nature and heaps of lovely relaxing walks. In the Winter (if we are lucky!) it is a snow-fest of fun, people of all ages with or without pets, running, laughing, having heaps of fun. Every time of year, this is such a magical destination.Close to Marble Arch tube, Hyde Park Corner, Green Park, Bayswater, Lancaster Gate, to name but a few - there are no shortages of ways to get here! You can walk from the vibrant lights of Oxford Street or hop on a bus and travel around the park and hop off wherever you fancy.Wander along the famous Park Lane, which skirts one side of the park and take in the luxurious sites of prestige cars, high end hotels and usually a few famous faces.....||December 13, 2013
494lindan||10||PLEASE PLEASE think of your safety before coming here. Its VERY crowded. If there was an incident I would be very concerned how the staff would react, as they seemed not at all bothered and were often just pushing people about ! The "Bouncers" are like ones on rough pub doors... hearding crowds with no concern for people falling or being squashed. Scarey for small children, and even adults. Even the queue to get into Hyde park was sooo bad it took over an HOUR!!!! People were 5 /6 deep, and there were lots of pushing and shoving. People were almost fighting at one point. We had pre booked ice skating tickets that we could not use, as we couldnt get into the area... We left 2 hours to get into the park and find the rink. Which I think is reasonable. I have asked the company for a refund but was told a flat NO ! The ice rink at 7pm was super packed and actually people speed skating made it quite dangerous for others. So maybe it was a blessing we didnt get to skate. Though my 13 yr old waas very upset. We knew the food and drink would be expensive, its London. So that was OK. Hog roast nice, but at £6.50 each, a bit steep if there are 4 of you. Organisers MUST REVIEW SAFETY LEVELS!! .....I could not recommmend coming here at all. Also be aware of pick pocketers, this is true in any large crowded area. But sure it must be a haven for them.If you want to see a nice German market go to Germany or even Birminghams Market event.||December 13, 2013
Jojo G||40||I have been there like once, but I like it and since was in the summer was really nice and was so busy, so many people sitting on the grass and you could see a lot of eye candy there ;). Since the park is huge you can do a lot of stuff there.||December 12, 2013
gavin w||10||I was staying in London for a conference. The tube line was all fouled up and so I decided to walk to the destination across the length of Hyde Park. It was 7.00 in the morning, first light, and I've never seen so many posh dogs taking a dump. Of course not a pooper scoop or a poo-bin to be seen. Disgusting.  Someone later told me there were no bins because of the IRA threat. Really! ! It got me thinking: and I guess if there is one thing worse than getting blown up by a bomb in a bin, its getting blown up by a bomb in a bin that's full of dog ****  The thought of families having picnics in the park later in the day just made me gag.UHhh!!!||December 12, 2013
tiggergoesabroad||50||My husband and I took our 2 year old here on Monday. We had been looking for somewhere decent to go to see Santa having been very disappointed last year by Bluewater. We made sure we got there early as we were worried about queuing for Santa. However we walked straight in and there was no queue. Santa was very good and we were allowed to take our own photos which I thought was excellent considering it was all free.There was so many rides suitable for our daughter's age group spread throughout the park and she was extremely happy with the choice. I did not think £2 / £3 per ride was overly expensive considering the park entrance was free and the rides lasted quite a long time.The food and drinks were also very reasonable and cheaper than most places on London. A hog roast sandwich was £6.50 but filled me up all day. Glass of Wine £5!The park got busier as the day wore on but the toilets remained clean as did the park.I have read some of the critical comments on here and wonder what some people expect at a winter wonderland? One person said it had lots of crappy stalls food places and rides? What else did you hope to find?I can imagine it gets expensive the more kids you have and the older they are but that's the same wherever you go. Plus you only spend what you want to, you don't have to go on all the rides or visit all the attractions.As a family with a young child we often find we pay over the odds for places where we cannot participate in most things (such as paying £85 for LEGOLAND but not being able to go on half the rides) so it was nice to see the benefit for once where we got free entry and cheaper rides!I strongly recommend a visit here but just prepared and save!||December 12, 2013
MyNextCharity||10||We visited Winter Wonderland on Saturday December 7th as a group of 4 (2 adults, 2 children (aged 12 and 16 years), arriving around 5pm. Pickpockets were waiting around Marble Arch, so be extremely careful with your valuables. The que to get in was at least a mile long, and there was no crowd control. Thankfully, we had pre-booked tickets for the "Magical Ice Kingdom" and got through very quickly, without anyone checking our tickets! Inside, there was no room whatsoever and we were struggling to move through the endless crowds of people. Finding the Ice Kingdom was a lengthy task, but when we eventually found it we hoped we would be rewarded. No such luck.The Magical Ice Kingdom was nothing but depressing. "Magical" means "beautiful or delightful in a way that seems removed from everyday life." It was everything but! We were expecting Christmassy, magical scenes, but instead were presented with Ogres with sledgehammers, witches and beheaded people! It was an incredibly short, depressing "kingdom" which left me dreading Christmas. I understand why there is a bar near the exit, to drown your sorrows at spending such a ridiculous amount of money on something so depressing! Upon leaving the renamed "Angry Ice Kingdom," we found that stalls and rides were extortionate prices and completely overrated. We left Winter Wonderland feeling disappointed and depressed. Thankfully, a walk up Oxford Street put us all back in the Christmas spirit!Winter Wonderland was not a wonderland, and my daughters decorations in our dining room made a much better Winter Wonderland than they did.||December 11, 2013

Nakedmel||20||Went with a friend to the Winter Wonderland today (10th Dec). Arrived around 11.30 am. It was nice to walk around, through the Christmas markets. After the Markets it was just one big Fair ground with loads of rides, and plenty of places to drink and eat. Prices for the rides, food and drink were quite steep. To ride, you have to buy Tokens. Small kids rides are 3 tokens. and if a parent rides with them its another 3 tokens. ( 1 token = £1.00 ) Large rides are 8 tokens per person. Total £ 8.00 a ride. Much too expensive for fair ground rides. Drinks and food was also expensive, so we decided to find a pub that served meals for lunch, which was much cheaper and warmer too.I am glad I went to see this Winter Wonderland, but I will not be visiting again, unless I take a Loan out from the bank.It is EXPENSIVE so be warned.||December 10, 2013

JackieG466||20||After having returned from visiting Christmas Markets in Germany and Holland, my husband and I decided to finish off our break by going to Winter Wonderland On Monday 9th December.We travelled from Cockfosters and decided to get off and walk from Green Park which I am glad we did we saw the Bomber Command monument and found this very moving.Arriving at Hyde Park and going into Winter Wonderland it was still light going into dusk and bit was quite atmospheric. At that time it wasn't too busy but we could see people were starting to pour in.There were many food and drink stalls but these were very expensive, almost double what we paid in Germany. Although there were quite a few rides, these again would work out expensive for a family and things like ice skating had to be prebooked.Although there appeared to be quite a lot of security staff around (which I feel would be needed later in the evening when busier) they majority seemed to be talking amongst themselves without paying much attention to what was going on.All in all, it was nice to walk around for an hour or so but I wouldn't bother to repeat this in future years as I was quite disappointed||December 9, 2013
LagosLawyer||40||I had a really fun time visiting the Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park for the first time. I only got on two rides at the Park but it was great fun and I had a really good time hanging out with friends there. The atmosphere was definitely perfect for the season!||December 9, 2013
Beth Y||10||My boyfriend and I set to Hyde park for Winter Wonderland for the morning.We walked round the park to find that the stalls were all exactly the same, from silly hats, food, and fake snow stalls.All in all, we was only at the theme park for an hour, the only rides that were their was a haunted house, big wheel, ice skating, Walters of which all these rides were extremely over priced and their was about 10 of the same rides.Would defiantly not visit again. Defiantly over raved about.||December 9, 2013
Disheartened2013||10||I booked up in October for my son, friend and myself to go to Winter Wonderland on 7th December 2013. We spent £60 on booking Ice Skating and the Ice Castle and also our train tickets from Birmingham.Our bookings started at 6.30pm so we got there at 4pm so we could have a look round and get a bite to eat before hand but when we got there the queue was over a mile along and about 6 people wide. We joined the queue and stood there in the cold watching arguments and fights over people pushing in. The queue barely moved in 2 hours. By this time we had missed our slot for the Ice Castle and my son was getting very paniced over fear of being trampled. There was no police, security or organisation of any kind there and there was thousands of people.In the end we left the queue and admitted defeat. I emailed the events company that runs Winter Wonderland asking for a refund and complaining of the poorly run event only to be told that they are not responsibe and I will not receive any kind of refund.You'd think at the very least they'd have a seperate queue for the people that have went to the effort of booking.Its safe to say that i will not be wasting my money on going there again, it is dangerous, poorly organised and only interested in taking your money.||December 9, 2013
georginag798||40||What a lovely experience is is visiting the Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park. Wrap up warm for a trip out to include ice skating, mulled wine, mini market stalls, rollercoasters and rides. Everyone has to go and experience it, whether it with kids or just adults! Food is amazing also!||December 9, 2013
mskittenheels||10||Myself, my friend and my son (aged 15 years) pre-booked in October to visit Hyde Park Wonderland on December 7th. We had heard it was a great day out, which i hate to shatter anyones illusions it certainly was not.At best i can say it looked christmassy however the other aspect peoples safety was horrifying, scenes of the Hillsborough disaster kept flicking through my head. As soon as we stepped off the tube we realised something was seriously wrong, they were no longer allowing anyone back on the tube they shut all stations within a mile radius. Great if you know london and where to go to get on at another station.The crowds were immense with absolutely no crowd control, we had pre booked tickets but the queue to even enter the grounds was over a mile long and 6 people deep, the queue stopped moving as so many people were pushing in further up - no crowd control nor any staff memebers about. The tempers in the queue started to flare and two adults started a fight over queue jumping, my poor son was traumastised, we tried to get away from the fighting but the crowds just pushed us back, we were very nearly crushed (and i am not exagerating it was probably one of the most scariest things i have witnessed).We had waited in the queue over an hour at this point and still wasnt near the entrance we had missed our prebooked slots for ice castle and just decided to try and leave - which is great if the tubes hadnt been shut due to the crowds!! we ended up traipsing around london trying to get a tube to take us to the station to get our tails back home, this was a distressing and frightening place to be. No crowd control, nor organisation and lacked a police presence which was utterly required.Horrifying I will never spend that kind of money again to visit our great capital - if i wanted that atmosphere i would put myself in the middle of a gangland turf war!||December 9, 2013
shazkowalski||10||We visited the winter wonderland thinking it would be a lovely festive romantic evening out.Instead we got an overpriced, overcrowded fairground- people rammed in to the point you couldn't move and basically rides surrounded by yet another Bavarian market.We visited the magical ice kingdom that cost nine quid each, queued for fifteen minutes despite rebooking and then basically queued the whole way around it struggling to get any photos because of how many people were let in at once. The whole thing took about ten minutes to get round and all in all very disappointing.Ice skating was again pre booked, queued for forty minutes then get the world most uncomfortable and blunt skates- queue again to actually get on the ice. The rink itself was nice with a very pretty tree in the centre- however in my opinion the organisers have got greedy and let far too many people on the ice at once to the extent that it was packed to a dangerous level.The park itself was difficult to navigate with very little in the way of signs etc and heaven help them if there had been an emergency.I have no intention of going back this year or any year in the future!!!||December 9, 2013
JoleneBurgess||50||We've visited Hyde Park many times now, at all times of the year. Wind, rain, sunshine and snow. As adults we appreciate the beauty and the history, no matter how recent it is. As parents we appreciate the environment and safety for our children. If you visit when there is no extra attraction like a conert, market etc then you will see everything that the park has to offer, otherwise appreciate that it's going to be a jostle to get through the crowds ( not ideal if you have small children). When walking through at night though it is not well lit in a few areas, even on the main path. We love Hyde Park!||December 8, 2013
Margaret B||40||We visited the Winter Wonderland attraction on Friday afternoon, and really enjoyed the experience. There was plenty of interesting Christmassy stalls to explore and lots of food outlets. Because of the number of food stalls the prices were reasonable competitive and there was something for everyone. We were all retired but all felt that it would have been great to make the visit with the Grandchildren as there was so many charming things for the children to see. There were lots of rides ranging from roundabouts for very young children to the big scary ones for the big children ( too scary for me). The Ice rink looked great fun and those on the ice seemed to be enjoying themselves. There were lots of things to see without spending too much but for those that wanted to spend more there was plenty of things to pay for. The rides seemed to cost around the 4 token mark which had to be purchased from a kiosk in the grounds , there were plenty of these around. The day we went there was very little in the way of queues even though the site was very busy. We all enjoyed it and it made the trip a real start to Christmas||December 8, 2013
julesd7||10||We visited this for the first time on Sunday 8 Dec. we were not allowed in to the entrance where the Xmas market cabins began. No - there were guards herding everyone towards the back (20 minute walk) and to a queue of 500 or more people. We then got herded in through the gates. It was noisy stuffed with people and we shuffled through. Our two children went on the high flying chairs - £7 each, lasted 3 minutes. But they enjoyed it. The ice skating looked good, but no tickets left. Toilets miles and miles away with massive queues. We finally made it to the street stalls, they looked lovely but we were too exhausted to stop and look. At the end some people just wanted to look at the German market stalls only, but we're told 'no' and were herded towards the massive queue to go through the entire park.Very badly organised. With extremely rude and heavy handed bouncers. Avoid it. Horrendous.||December 8, 2013
kenobi||20||I HATED Winter Wonderland. It is over priced and feels very cynically commercial. I have a 5 year old and soon learned that this was NOT the charming place I had hoped to have some fun at Christmas. It's probably good fun if you're aged between say 20-35 and want to get drunk with your friends, as you would in a fairground, but didn't love it with a young child. It's far too crowded and busy. The Ice Kingdom was lovely at the start, but soon included quite scary Orc type ice sculptures, with strange noises, which coupled with the dark, scared our child - again probably fine for older children. Zippo's circus was the best bit and felt far more traditional and family friendly. The queues for the Big Wheel are chaotic at best and lots of people shoving in and not well organised at all - why are there no 'time slots' for this as there are for the other paying attractions. It lacked any real charm and was not for us at all. Go if you are in a large group of friends and want to get drunk and go on fairground rides!||December 8, 2013
pedropedlar||50||This is my third year of going to Winter Wonderland and it bets better every year. Why do I go? We'll the atmosphere is fantastic, the craft stalls are terrific and so is the entertainment. The entry is well managed and plenty of staff to help. It has many bars for people to enjoy themselves in and I note that people were carrying drinks around but don't worry I did not see any trouble. Plenty of toilets were also provided. If you have children or not this is a fun place to go.||December 8, 2013
benSouthEast||10||We went 7/12/13 afternoon & had to queue to get in, from there it just got worse. You could hardly move & if you suffer from claustrophobia forget it! We tried to get to some of the stalls selling their wears but gave up as so many around. You were literally nose to tail shuffling round & took us 40 minutes to get from one side to get straight out the other as we had had enough from the outset & we are pretty easy going!||December 7, 2013
MissJillUK||40||This was a fun experience for our family staying across the road at the hilton. We paid two visits, the ice rink was our favourite and the German market has a nice range of holiday gifts. As others have commented it is on the pricey side but our kids loved it. They are old enough to visit on their own and felt safe at all times, even late into the evening.||December 7, 2013
Martin D||50||visited Sunday 1st Dec, was very busy and a queue to get in, but well worth it. Bavarian village is our favourite stop with the live music and plenty of bars and eateries. Christmas market is excellent with a wide range of stalls to choose from.||December 7, 2013
Holly L||20||We went to Winter Wonderland with my parents, my brother and our one year old. There's not much that is good to take toddlers too, but it is a shame that there is a lack of high chairs, baby changing facilities and an indoor runaround area for littler children so this is not hugely family friendly, probably better to take children from 5 years upwards as these older children seemed to be having a wonderful time. It would be nice to see stalls selling child friendly food and and a non-alcoholic mulled wine version for mums or dads and others who want to join in the festive spirit but without alcohol. We have been every year except last year when our newborn prevented it,and it has gotten progressively larger, more corporate, and more expensive - the jump up in prices was a shock to use this year. I missed the food stalls being at the entrance and the Christmas music with the animated deer head was missing too which has been there every other year. Also some of the stalls that were usually there were missing. So we missed these little touches which had been like coming back to an old friend.In the beginning couple of years there were many more individual stalls selling more interesting stuff. The tat has always been there but before it was much more interesting to look around. Also in the early years the quality of food was better, this year we felt the food quality was really poor in general, and I've noticed other reviewers saying the same. Nice touches were the 'roast your own marshmallows' section and the enormous marquee eating area which will be good when it's cold outside! All the staff were friendly too, which was so nice and a credit to them especially when they must be a bit cold! I think the live music would make it a great place for groups of friends with a bit of money to go one evening to get merry on mulled wine.Overall we kind of agreed that this is the last year we will go for a while because we feel that it has grown so quickly that the organisers haven't had a chance to sit down and think about things like controlling prices and layout and catering for all types of groups, and as a result it's turning into a place devoid of Christmas spirit and individuality and you would be better off going to a travelling circus when it comes your way as you get all the rides and the candyfloss/hotdogs and some tat for a fraction of the price.||December 7, 2013
tridiogo||40||Hyde Park is a perfect site for some physical workout or some play with your children as long as the weather cooperate. Once I had booked 1 night in Baysawater area, just 400 mts away from Hyde Park´s north entrance, I couldn´t resist to do a early morning long running workout through the park, and enjoying the peaceful and magnificient of this historical site in the heart of London. During Christmas time, also take place the Winter Wonderland, where you can enjoy a ice-skating experience, take a flight on the Giant Observation Wheel, or go to the Circus shows. It´s a perfect treat for all the family.||December 6, 2013
babes40808||20||We took are clients to winter wonderland in Hyde park at 11.30am and was very disappointed . Parking is a nightmare if you have a minibus-you have to pre book even with disable badge. The theme was more German than English . Food and drink all German and very expensive. £4 for a slice of pizza and only percolated coffee available unless you buy from a stall at £3.50. The market stalls German again with lots of lovely bits but very expensive.the fun fair you have to buy tokens to go on the rides , bumper cars £6 per person. All other amusements £2 a go for the tombola ect but no hope in winning something. Not all rides and attractions open .ice kingdom shut. The atmosphere was very Christmassy but I wouldn't go again.||December 6, 2013
cjslaterhot77||20||Merry Christmas !!!!! Now give us your money.....We go every year and over the past 3 we have started to see the ugly head of greed peak through the ice palace ! 180 quid lighter I feel quite ripped of this year ! Queues stupid even though we paid on line ! And a rude polish woman demanding the credit card we paid with as we have a price error ! Erm no error just your attitude stinks ! The markets are amazing lots of nice stuff yet also lots of tat ! The ice palace thing has got worse ..... And they charge for that ! 6 quid a Ride horrific some nice baileys hot chocolate at 6 quid a glass with whip and some nice gluvinne ( I hope I have spelt that correct ) Will we be back 2014 ....... No Not unless they lower the price for the rides Have a speedy ticket pick up line Speedy being the word to focus onOption of printable tickets or make a app for the phone Investing in decent team as I don't think one person said merry christmas to us ! Oh wait the cleaner did while cleaning up some child vomit from the toilets near the fair............. Hyde park shame on you for making money on people's dreams ............ It's festive yes but not 180 quid festive for all activities rides and food and drink ! Not good Hyde park the promoters need to act fast or hopefully the queen will behead you all .......... ||December 6, 2013
antonia p||50||We managed to beat the rush. Got into the ice kingdom with no queues. Amazing sculptures. There were some excellent scary rides for teenagers, as well as a range of roundabouts and side stalls. Lots of German style cabins with plenty of choice of food and alcohol. Festive music and lights. The ambience was just right. On the way out, more stalls of pretty things. The southbank has a very similar set up of these, but fine to go to both, depending what you are looking for. Southbank is more classy. Hyde park all-the-fun-of-the-fair.||December 6, 2013
shirleyEastMidlands||40||I visited this with family including grandson who's nearly 3 years old, arriving at about 11.30am on a Friday. It was busy but not uncomfortably crowded, but there was a surprisingly large number of school age children on what was a school day. The comments here about prices are true. The rides were expensive especially if an adult had to accompany a small child - £6 to go on the helter-skelter! Save money by taking your own food and some drinks, there are plenty of places you can sit down.Many of the attractions are too big for toddlers. There is only one bouncy slide and it's huge. They need to think about having an under 5s section. We left at 3.30 and the crowds were beginning to increase. We saw plenty of stewards And they were friendly and cheerful. Toilet facilities were OK although not all of the units were open.||December 6, 2013
DJC026||40||Whilst in London, in November 2013 and on the way to see the lights at Harrods, we passed through Hyde Park and its festive set up / entertainment - Winter Wonderland. I knew very little of this. I knew from other years the odd ride was put up and an ice rink and I knew from the previous year there apparently was not a great deal there and cost to get in. We wondered up to the entrance, feeling if there was a fee to get in, we would not bother but to our surprise it was free.It started off as a delightful little street of mini shops, all looking very Christmassy set up as cabins, with lights and snow for decoration. The stalls sold a multitude of things from sweets to clothing. Basically this was a mini Christmas market as it were. At the end of this were a couple of stalls for eating and drinking. This is where the money must be made! They were selling mulled cider, something my partner and I had never tried so we thought it would be a good time to, getting into the Christmas spirit. The price was £4.30 a cup and it raised our eyebrows somewhat but we had not seen the size of the glass / cup at this stage so gave it the benefit of the doubt. Of course when it was served up it was a very small cup, almost child size you would say. The cider itself was actually very nice, so we laughed it off, learning our lesson not to buy food or drink from this particular attraction!The food bit, which was next to the market stalls, also then linked to the main Wonderland and that is exactly what it was. I am not sure why there was so little there in 2012 (if in fact that is true) but the place was rammed and buzzing with rides, stalls with games and bright, flashing lights everywhere. It was quite a sight and although essentially a very impressive fun fair, it was all winter and Christmas themed and gave you a perfectly warm Christmas feel, as if it was already here. The ice rink was here as always and was very spacious. It does cost to use as you would expect but for those not wanting to pay, watching could be entertainment enough, as people slipped and slid all over the place.Making your way through there were all types of rides - rollercoaster's, huge tall rides that shot you up and down again, ghost houses, children's rides, a Ferris wheel and a very impressive looking winter cave. On top of this there was a multitude of stalls with games, where you could win prizes. As we walked around in the circle layout, it seemed to go on forever, there is an awful lot to do here. Of course the downside to this is, that everything will cost you to go on or participate. We were only passing, enjoying the sights and getting an early dosage of Christmas feeling so we did not look at prices for each ride unfortunately - however if the cider was anything to go by, it would not have been that cheap.All in all, we were really pleased we passed this and walked through. It was a terrific sight to see all the lights flashing, decorations and rides launching into life - not to mention some great music being played. Plus it really gave you that feeling of Christmas and fun. If rides and / or Christmas are not your thing, I would not recommend this at all. Be wary of prices too, particularly on the food and drink front, probably picking stuff up from newsagents for far cheaper if possible. If you have the time and happy to spend a bit on rides / attractions you would have a whale of a time here and I could think of far worse things to do on a cold, winters evening. Oh and for those who wondered, the lights at Harrods were well worth a view too - impressive as ever!||December 6, 2013
Pat C||50||So much to see, so much to eat, so much interesting stalls to take pictures with. I just didn't prepare myself enough time to enjoy them all. Since I just made this time to Winter Wonderland as a stop by before meeting my friend nearby when I thought it could be only had 2 rows of stalls to wander like 2008. I ended up being late & too rush with food on both hands to share with her. Will try my best to go again with more time to check everything out. And my friend will go to check it out herself when I presented her with the candle I bought in 1 of the stall. And the ground is well laid to walk on this time & so much easier for buggies & wheelchair. What not to like???||December 5, 2013
Venusalberta33||50||I walked along the path from Hyde Park corner and peeked through Winter Wonderland. It was what I expected but the best part was walking along the paths under the trees where autumn's beautiful leaves still hung. Actually there were some roses in bloom on this last day in November. Walking along the lake past the swans and past the Princess Diana's water feature was so peaceful; a great break from Piccadilly or Oxford. It was more beautiful than I expected at this time of year. Don't miss it! I continued to Serpentine Gallery which had a great exhibit. A great day!||December 5, 2013
JaxC380||50||We had a lovely night her loads to do my son loved all the rides , loads to eat and loads to see. The ice sculptures were amazing all in all it was a fantastic family night with lots to do will definitely go again . Plenty to see and buy , your kids will love it !||December 5, 2013
DSB36||40||Visited winter wonderland for the first time and had a number of high hopes! I was impressed with the huge number of stalls and attractions, theme bars and stage shows!However be warned, this comes at a cost. For example the mulled wine is £4 and served in a paper cup, and a hog roast bun was £6.50 and it wasn't even luke warm. Beware if you take the kids as it will cost you an arm and a leg!||December 5, 2013

hdls||40||We were in London for a long weekend. We decided to have a trip round Hyde park. It was a lovely place. It was clean, felt safe. It was a quick visit but we managed a walk round and sight of the serpentine and speakers corner.||December 4, 2013
luckieleo5408||50||Great place to chill out and picnic, or go for a jog, or people watch, or dog walk, or wander around and take pictures. Has a lovely bike path. It's really big, so even though I walked from my flat to my school every day through here, I still haven't seen all of it. There's a separate bike path too. stay off it if you're walking! There's a serpentine gallery, toilets, a little cafe stand. it's adorable!!Winter Wonderland - little theme park opens for christmas time here.||December 4, 2013
nixob29||50||After visiting winter wonderland with my husband on Tuesday evening and we couldn`t have enjoyed it more! yes it is expensive but we are in London people the food prices are pretty standard for a normal fairground around the country. As you walk around there are lots of little cabins with christmas items all covered in fairy lights which look very pretty. With regards to the rides there is nothing saying you have to go on everything or even anythinh. We went and had an enjoyable look around and something to eat and spent less than £10.00 and had 2hours there taking in the atmosphere.Overal, lovely place to visit if you dont want to pay London prices, dont go to London!!!||December 4, 2013
cpwife||20||Quite disappointed this year. There are temporary walls around this year, making it difficult to enter and exit. The line to enter was approx. 1 hour wait. As I only had a day in London, was unable to visit this year. I like it better without the "wall" around so you could stroll through easier. As I am older, and am not interested in the rides, it would have been nice to get in to see the crafts.||December 4, 2013
SandW-Hampshire||40||I visited with my wife and her friend so I was really just expecting to be the one who carried the shopping. However, we all had a great time. The whole place had a great atmosphere which really created a good Christmas spirit. We didn't go on any of the rise but did go into the Ice Kingdom which was well worth the money (although I have never been so cold in my life!). There were plenty of different type of shops in the chalets with a range of interesting and different items. Also a lot of places to eat although much of this was german sausage and similar items - not much in the way of a healthy choice. We arrived at around 11am and it was fairly quiet so easy to get round. I imagine that the place really comes to life in the evening and I would love to go back next year and do an evening visit. As another reviewer has said though it closes at 10pm, portably just add the party is really getting warmed up.Very pleased to have visited and may well go again next year.||December 4, 2013
ljb80||50||We have been going to Winter Wonderland since it started and again this year it doesn't disappoint. Yes the food and drink can be on the pricey side, yes rides can be quite a lot but we went with a budget and stuck to it. You cannot help but get in to the festive spirit and our little one had huge smiles all the time she was there.You have to buy tokens for the rides and over £10 you can use a card (less and you are charged a fee I think). You can buy tickets for the attractions on the day at this time of year but closer on they will probably all be booked up. Toilets were very clean and they were easy to find, there were lots of rides for little ones, theres a huge variety of food, and this year there are tressle tables near the Santa area where you can sit should you have your own picnic.We have been each year to the circus nd that is always great but there is so much to do that you don't need to go to the extra attractions. This is a great family attraction where you can all have loads of fun, can't help smiling and feeling festive and can spend as little or as much as you want!||December 4, 2013
Andie190||40||I went to winter wonderland with my sister in Tuesday 3rd December. We had pre booked tickets for the ice Kingdom and the wheel. We arrived approx 1am. It was a bit busy but not crowded. We walked round the park first seeing all the Stalls and checking out where to buy the best food and drinks. Found a couple of stalls selling mulled wine for £4 and it was good quality. The atmosphere was lovely and the festive music could be heard all around. The ice Kingdom was great. Expensive yes, but such talent! We wrapped up in hats and gloves because it was so cold (as advertised) and spent a good 30 minutes walking round and taking pics. The ice slide was funny and we didn't queue at all. There's also a little bar just after the slide selling vodka shots. Try the Gold vodka!! We waited til dark before going on the wheel. It was chilly but great views of the park and I could see the London Eye! You get a choice of commentary but we chose the christmas music. No fast track on the wheel for prepaid folk but there wasn't a cue when we went so didn't need to complain. The rides looked fantastic. We spent a lot of time stood watching with a mulled wine, and wondering how people had the nerves to go on these things! We went in the haunted mansion (£5) which was a good giggle and got the heart rate up, the mousetrap (£6) which a) reminded me of being a kid at Blackpool and b) terrified and traumatised me, and the waltzers (£6) which were the best ride in my opinion. Foodwise there is so much to choose from. Grab a bite from a stall and there's so many huts to sit in or benches to stand at, or wander further into the park and there's little restaurants and even big dining halls. Cheaper end of the food range £4-£6 or £12-£15 if dining in one of the halls. Everything so festive though with a great atmosphere. There's also a carousel bar which slowly spins as you drink. Beautiful. The stalls were plentiful and we must have looked round them several times, each time seeing something new. We left approx 7.30pm. It was busier than in the day but no great crowds. I think we chose well to go on a Tuesday as our friends sent in Saturday and described crowds like some of the other reviews do. Definately worth a visit.||December 4, 2013

teresaplane||20||Went on Monday 2nd arriving at 19.20. Quite busy with adults, mainly couples and groups of adult friends. Watch out for careless people with cigarettes dangling by their sides as they wander around. Too many near miss cigarette burns on clothes!The ice rink looked far too crowded. If someone fell It looked like a collision would be inevitable.The Magical Ice Kingdom can be seen in 5 minutes!! It only takes longer to see if you have to stop and wait for someone taking photos ahead of you. It is as expected VERY cold. The ice slide is ok which everyone can go on if they wish adults too. There is a lot of graffiti written on an ice wall even though there is a notice asking people NOT to do this! This really did spoil the scene. Its very samey, lots of the same ice trees etc to look at. Some models really do look good but it isn't worth the £9 entry fee. At the end there is a photo opportunity when two pic's are taken but the sting is £8 for one print or £10 for the two.Mulled wine is £4.20 a cup and mulled wine with a shot of Amaretto in is £6 a cup.Yes it is free to walk around but it would be impossible not to spend a fortune here with children.There are Christmas Market huts selling the same goods at Southbank. There are only a very few rides at Southbank and a Father Christmas whom really does look like Father Christmas wandering about. My advice would be to avoid Winter Wonderland and head for Southbank instead!||December 3, 2013
232NICC||10||DO NOT GO.We spent £80.00 on pre booked tickets for the 3 of us to see the circus, Ice Kingdom and Observatory Wheel.Circus - less than average!, Ice Kingdom - OK, but the slide - well I wouldn't call it that after waiting 30 minutes to not even 'slide' down something!, Wheel - utter chaos - don't bother booking tickets we still had to wait an hour, they did not have a clue..Rides £6.00 per adult and £4.00 per child! - REALLY...Christmas Market - NOPE, a couple of overpriced stalls, but mainly fairground stuff, drinks and food..Such a shame as walking in all looked promising..FAR TOO BUSY - they had stopped people coming in by about 6pm..We did enjoy what we did - but felt that it promised to be so much and wasn't.Kids will love it though - and that is the main thing!||December 3, 2013
Danny C||10||Agree with many of the reviews below. The emphasis is on making money and this is clear - it's incredibly expensive. But more worryingly is how many people they cram in, and how badly laid out the 'wonderland' is. At one point two converging crowds forced a complete stand-still between some of the stalls. There was no space between any people. Far from being a Winter Wonderland or even just an over-hyped funfair, Winter Wonderland is dangerous.||December 3, 2013
MWFleming||50||Fantastic! Everything is very over the top but it's totally worth it. We went at 2pm and spent a good few hours there. Beers and mulled wine and cider are a total winner - I had a great hog roast sandwich from the happy hog van and my girlfriend had a ribeye steak sandwich from another stall served nice and rare which looked awesome. Got a great little jar of chutney as a present and with about 20-30 to try for free I was spolit for choice. Picked up a nice selection of cheese and crackers from the cheese man and then went to the Magical Ice Kingdom (be warned it is very very very cold in there). To everyone saying it's too expensive..you are in London. Get over it! If you don't bring a few hundred quid along and have a laugh at a christmas market once a year you are not going to have any fun. Jagermeister stands are worth a visit as well.||December 3, 2013
SHigh73||20||We visited this year with two young children. As everyone says it is incredibly expensive, the food is terrible (and expensive!) and the rides are incredibly short (and expensive!). The staff couldn't have less Christmas spirit if they tried. The kids loved it but we felt like we'd been mugged. Won't be repeating.||December 3, 2013
431SarahE||10||As you walk down from Marble Arch, it all looks very exciting. But the lack of lighting on the footpaths, which makes it very hard to see where your walking in the dark, does not prepare you for the queue of hundreds of people waiting to get in. They decided to stagger groups entering as the park was so full. We stood and watched as on opening the barriers as mass of people surged forward. It would have been awful for people with young children, I think.Appeared totally unsafe and I doubt anyone would have got near the rides due to the sheer volume of people. Definitely needs some serious re-organisation, before someone gets hurt. ||December 2, 2013
TravellerDG2||20||Is it beautiful? Sure. Is it fun for all the family? Yes! Does it cater for all budgets? No bloody way! Absolutely over priced to the point of being just out right thieving! £2.50 for a can of coke, £6 to go on one children's ride! A joke for anyone I'd say!! The Stewart's also deserve a special mention for their lack of knowledge and poor customer service. A great day out ruined by greed and poor staffing.||December 2, 2013
essexvicky||40||There I so much to do here and out of all the christmasy days out we have taken my daughter to in the past this tops it for Christmas spirit. We went the 1st weekend it opened and the crowds wasn't bad at all during the day. At about 7.30pm it got a lot busier with a lot of adults without children visiting. There was hen parties and stag parties there but I didn't see any rowdy behaviour just people having fun. There really is something for everyone there whether you have children with you or not. Loved the look of the après ski bar and carousel bar. My 6 year old loved the rides and id like to thank the man who gave my husband £40 of tokens as he was leaving the park. I didn't see any shelter so if it rained you might not want to be there. We visited the ice kingdom and it is freezing in there. 30 minutes was the most we could last in there. As you walk out of there the cold London air actually feels warm which gives you some idea of how cold it is in there. You definitely shouldn't take small children or babies in there. Its lots of impressive ice sculptures, a small ice bar and a short ice slide that everyone got stuck on. I'm used to working outside in all weathers and know layers are what keeps you warm. I had thermals and layers on top that day and still was freezing in there. We looked at the ice skating rink which was a lot smaller than I expected and had too many people on it. It looked like you had to be of a reasonable standard of skating to go on as you had to follow the crowd tightly round. I didn't see any stewards inside the winter wonderland at all and only a couple on the entrances. I didn't see any lost children point and would like to know what arrangements are in place if a child went missing as there was no announcement tannoy. I also didn't see any first aid but im sure there must have been somewhere. It really is bigger than you first think in there. I'd like to think there are a lot of undercover police policing the event. Flooring was laid everywhere so you wasn't walking in mud anywhere as i'm sure in previous years I have read that it was muddy. Also we didn't queue for more than 5 minutes for any ride but the queue for father Christmas looked long. We had a great time and I really don't think there's anywhere else like here||December 2, 2013
sean1975uk||20||We went early on the Sunday 01st Dec. Already it was overcrowded, and with 2 young children you have to kind off roll with the push of the crowd. The rides are way overpriced and very short in duration. Everything is very overpriced and sellers/ride supervisors seem agitated. It's not a pleasant experience especially with young children. They have gotten greedy. ||December 2, 2013
ShadowyMan||40||Stumbled upon this the day after it opened while spending a weekend in London. We didn't have kids with us and the night was a little nippy, but we had a blast looking at the sights and people watching. Weird fun houses, carnival rides, games of skill, decent food and all varieties of beverages all add up to a lot of fun if you don't mind the crowds. Sustained by doses of mulled wine, we spent almost two hours here just wandering. Families, tots, teens and even girls in heels were doing the same and having a great time. Not sure I would want to be there in the rain, and lights are cooler to see at night, but anytime would be a good time to go.If I had to sum it up as a movie pitch, I'd say it's Blackpool meets Kensington, but it's great fun no matter what age you are.||December 2, 2013
nomadq||10||We went on Saturday evening (1st Dec) having pre booked tickets for the Ice Kingdom. On arrival there was a massive queue waiting to be let in, had we waited in it we would have missed our time slot for the Ice Kingdom so we managed to gain entry by flashing our ticket at security.The Ice Kingdom itself was beautiful but the experience was spoilt by the large number of people they allowed in to it. As for value for money- probably not worth it. As for the other rides etc... Prices are ridiculous. My husband bought the ride tokens just so our children could experience some of what was on offer. We ended up having to give them away however as the area became so overcrowded it was impossible to get around. As others have mentioned the place was seriously dangerous on Saturday night. There are only a few exits and lots of dead ends so people were stuck like cattle unable to move. We had two children with us the youngest was on several occasions crushed and pushed by adults. If there had been a security issue/ emergency I would not like to think of what would have happened.We were so angry leaving we actually contacted the police and placed a complaint. Please think carefully before attending this event with children.||December 2, 2013
Anscombes||10||Was so looking forward to our trip to Hyde Park. We went in a group of 4 adults, 1 young couple and 2 children. The fairground is very big and very loud and even more packed than you can imagine. The market stalls are all really expensive (even compared with German markets) Glu Wien out of plastic cups!! Luke warm sausage!! We couldn't wait to go through from 1 side to the exit. There is no magic to be had there so if you hate excessive crowds and loud fairground noise, give this a massive swerve||December 2, 2013
lost_bear12||30||Think I'm in agreement with a lot of reviews on here, while the children (15, 13, 11, & 10 yrs old) enjoyed the ice skating, which was reasonable priced when I booked online, the rest is over priced and very cramped considering the size of Hyde Park it could be spread out more. The fun fair is very expensive and I'd imagine the queues get worse as the day goes on. We arrived at 11'ish and left at 15'ish and it was noticeably how much busier it got during that time, as we left the queue to get in was awful. Would suggest arrive early if you have pre-booked tickets for one the attractions and not a place to take small children in buggies.||December 2, 2013
MichelinStarFoodie||10||I dont know what was more scary, the rides or the thought of being crushed by the huge crowds of people they had allowed in. Really poorly managed, overpriced and a completely awful experience. In no way magical or wonderous, just people wanting to make as much as they can, from as many people as possible. Maybe its better to go on a quieter day, but i really cant recommend it. People with small children should take notice of the reviews for sure.||December 2, 2013
mattyr87||10||If I could rate less than 1 I would. Nothing like it was advertised. Best way to describe it is an a glorified funfair. Not suitable for youngsters at a all. With ride prices between £5-7 you need to be crazy to consider this as a family event. Mass overcrowding. A free event that they let too many people into (the kept closing it due to overcrowding). Inside you could barely move, at times coming to a standstill as no one could get anywhere and more enclosed than in a crowd at a festival. Lots of bars and hot dog stands. Very few market stalls and a lot of people consuming alcohol making it a dangerous environment for youngsters. The ice kingdom was pretty impressive and remember to wrap up warm as it's sooo cold. However this attraction can't save the event that was a shocking disappointment. ||December 2, 2013
dovey68||40||I had a stroll around winter wonderland with my husband this weekend, 1/12/13. We last came here a few years ago and it consisted of 20 market stalls and funfair rides. It has now in my opinion got better. There are about 200 market stalls now selling various arts and crafts and festive foods with a christmassy atmosphere. Yes the food and drink retailers seem to cash in uneccessarily, £2.50 for a can of coke....really?, but thats a typical tourist area trait...tarnish the experience though it does. Yes it was uncomfortably crowded, again this is to be expected at a tourist attraction during a popular time...think a beach on a hot bank holiday. This is what christmas is about and I enjoyed the market and atmosphere. As for other attractions, not so great. I dont think christmas is a time for funfair attractions, especially as they are overpriced, hard for families with young children I'm sure. If you want funfair then go to a theme park. This should be a christmas attraction. We arrived at hyde park quite early and already announcements were being made over a tannoy that tickets were sold out for events that day.Overall, the market is nice but the rest is a bit money grabbing. I would definately go again next year....just to the market. It was a good idea to seperate the market from the funfair so you could avoid that part.||December 1, 2013
confusedLondon99||10||Taking two little ones is far too dangerous. Massively overcrowded. Rides which were £2 last year are now £3 and I suspect are not as long as they were last year. Dread to think what would happen if there was some sort of accident. Don't go with tiny children.||December 1, 2013
sandy k||40||GOOD I went to Winter Wonderland yesterday with the family. It is very very large area so take comfortable shoes. We went durning the day into the evening and it realy come alilve once the lights go on lots to do big attractions for adults an older children and also ones for the smaller ones Circus which was brilliant although don't sure if anyone over 12 would enjoy it as much ( we had children under 7 who thought it was great big wheel, the ice ring etc lots and lots of rides. plenty of places to eat, buy drinks, and ofcourse the stalls selling Christmas goodies some really good BAD hardly any places to sit so if you have mobility problems don't go or take your own seat. Also only a few of the food stalls had somewhere for you to sit while you eat your food . Very overpriced but then did I expect any different as its London and Xmas. NOT enough signs hard to find toilets etc. esp when it gets so crowded we got separated and it was a nightmare should be more LARGE signs saying you are here so you can find your way aroung I kept going around in circles for 15 mins nightmare esp when you have small kids with you NOT enough toilets for the number of people there OVERALL great Xmas experience and although free to get in expensive once you are thereTake lots of money and if you are taking small children go during the day||December 1, 2013
Rob S||30||Hyde Park itself seemed like a very nice area, but when we went the Winter Wonderland dominated the area. So, we decided to go in and check everything out. Coming from Germany, almost everything at the Winter Wonderland was very familiar. The "German Village" section was almost identical to Christmas Markets we've gone to out here. The other section just seemed like any other carnival/fair I've been to. There were duplicate market stalls everywhere, so while it initially seems like there are hundreds of different sellers, there are really only a fraction . Most seemed to be selling mass produced things like hats and scarves or other trinkets. The food there was all over priced, with most drinks costing almost £5 each and the food well over that. The carnival games were equally pricey. Ice skating and the circus were absurdly expensive, but we did end up going to the circus to kill some time. It was an hour long, and not as bad as I expected, but definitely not worth the massive price tag. Overall it was a decent way to spend some time walking around and taking in the "Christmas Spirit", but I would definitely not want to go with small children or plan on playing many games or going on many rides.||December 1, 2013
katie s||10||Nothing winter wonderland about it just a glorified funfair, such a disappointment, dangerously over crowded, no place for small children in buggies got very scary when it became gridlocked in one area, groups of young people very drunk. very few staff around, very poorly run, nothing like it looks on the website,||December 1, 2013
bonflipinjour||10||This could have been so nice if they hadn't let far to many people in!!! It was scary at times thinking you were going to get crushed. You had your nose in the persons hair in front of you and stuck in the same position for 45 mins!! People shouting and very stressed, Telling you not to go in any further!! Awful experience, police said the organisers needed to sort it out it was dangerous!! ||December 1, 2013
rover901||20||We visited n the first day this year and I have to report that they have truly surpassed themselves on the rip-off front than on previous years. Someone organising this seem to have learned how to squeeze even more dosh out of the mugs that are prepared to drink flat German beer from plastic cups or eat cold undercooked and overpriced Bratwurst! There are more side shows this time and the fair ground rides seem a bit more spectacular but overall, go to the pub first have fish and chips before you arrive and give all of your money to the first bloke you see upon arrival -then go home. It'll save you having to traipse around for a couple of hours in the cold trying not to get your pocket picked; oh, the queues at Green Park are down right dangerous LRT beware! this is an accident of epic standard's waiting to happen, if you don't police the tube better, someone's gonna die in the crush!||December 1, 2013
Greaty44||30||We love a Xmas Market after being to some in Europe and several times to the Manchester Xmas Market, so as we were visiting family in the south we thought we'd try out Winter Wonderland. We don't regret going but it was more than an Xmas Market and the extra bits didn't add any value to us. We weren't interested in the funfair rides or the ice rinks. We just wanted to browse the stalls and enjoy the Gluhwein and Bratwurst. Compared to Manchester there were a lot less stalls and less variety. With lots of people attending it also meant it was hard to get to see what was on the stands. There was though plenty of food and drink stands but another disappointment was that every Xmas market we had been to you could keep buy the mug you with Gluhwein as a "keep sake". Not here the Gluhwein came in a plastic foam cup.If you are into spending lots of money on fun fair rides then this is the place for you. If you are interested in a Xmas market then don't bother.||December 1, 2013
TheHoyles||10||A total rip off and dangerously overcrowded on a Saturday, £7.00 for a 90 second ride is shocking. We tried to make the most of it but certainly wouldn't go back it is not a Christmas experience. We left around 4.30 pm the queue to get out was gridlocked and hundreds of people were trying to get in so it could only have got worse! The organisers really need to re-think this event.||December 1, 2013
liesja||10||Yesterday evening after a lovely day in London we went to Hyde Park. I booked for the Winter Wonderland big wheel on line, the advice was go before 2100 hours, we went at 1930.We were directed through the amusement park which was gridlocked in many places eventually we came to a complete standstill, people where pushing and we were getting crushed so turned back.We had a look around the small market, which was average considering London is the capital city! then we were directed to another entrance for the Winter not so Wonderland. On arriving we where faced by more queuing, there was no supervision, the prepaid queue was a free for all. When we finally got to the big wheel we were queuing again only to find people paying at the time were being fast tracked even though they had paid the same amount as those of us who had had the stupidity of pre-paying. Many people gave up and went away with out using their tickets, a clever tactic by the organisers.The||December 1, 2013
Guillaume R||10||Mostly we go to winter wonderland every year. This year, i believe it was a massive success for the event company. However, such a success on a week end, means a crowd not controlled properly ! No stewards inside the village, and people outside the gates were just shoving us inside. The result as you can imagine, around 10,000 people within the narrow street of the village, no security at all (no steward inside), still water at 3,5 GBP and burgers prices starting at 5GBP (Plain). If at least the experience was enjoyable and you had no crazy drunk people in the village, that would have been fantastic. However, after getting pushed, and yes hurt, i decided to never put my family in this park ever again, and i hope many will follow my advice.||December 1, 2013
Seren2006||40||Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park is a great place to get in to the Christmas spirit and spend a couple of hours walking around looking at the attractions. We didn't go on any of the rides, so can't comment on the price of things. We did have a hot cider, which was very tasty, and cost £8 for two.Very nice experience, though I'm sure it's a pricey place for families.||December 1, 2013
Detch17||10||this place used to be so great but it has gone very down hill……too busy, unorganised, expensive place to go and visit…. what a shame used to be such a great place.||December 1, 2013
LadbrokeSquare||10||We are a family with children who have attended this event every year since it was launched. This year it was different - badly organised and absolutely no crowd control. The risk of crush injuries to young children is VERY REAL! We observed horrifying scenes last night and the staff prohibited us from using the escape lanes as they "weren't allowed" - ABSOLUTE MADNESS! ||December 1, 2013
Shayne H||40||Great fun for all ages but I would suggest you visit on a week day if you can as the crowds on weekends are enormous, loads of rides, bars and different forms of entertainment everywhere you look, this is not just for kids people of any age can go and enjoy themselves here they cater for everyone, be warned your bank account will take a beating but you will have great fun.If you are gluten intolerant you will not find anything to eat in the whole place but that is the only reason I have gave 4 and not 5 stars.Go there you wont regret it.||December 1, 2013
tuttipr||50||Open only for 2 months. It's a great place to spend the day in this amusement park in Hyde Park. Easy to go via tube. Free entrance. Rides are £2-7/ride. Los of markets, food, drinks, porta-loos. Great place for everyone. Open 10am-10pm. Less queues if you go about lunch time. But the lights are beautiful at night. Happy Holidays! ||November 30, 2013
James C||20||If you want to experience rip off Britain at its best, then this is the Christmas event for you. The "from" prices really are what they say and the majority of rides will cost you a lot more. If you also want that famous ice slide experience I would suggest pouring some hot water down your driveway on a frosty night: cheaper, less queuing and probably a few feet bigger! The only upside is the food and drink which is standard pricing for London and what you would expect from a Christmas market. It seems that a lot of effort goes into this side of the event and they do a decent job which is sadly let down by the rest. The event was as claustrophobic as the tube on the way home but at least the tube was warm.||November 30, 2013
Ljjema||40||We had a wonderful evening at winter wonderland. The atmosphere was brilliant and the kids loved it. I know people say its expensive but its London and I didnt think 3 double cheeseburgers and a hotdog for £16 was bad at all. I wouldn't book the ice Kingdom again but love walking around and looking at the market stalls. We will definitely go again. ||November 30, 2013
HannahJacobs||40||Second time we have made the trip down to winter wonderland. We make a weekend of it while staying at friends. Ok it is pricey but there is loads to do, something for all the family and a great day to create memories. It does get very busy so keep a close on on family but we all came away having had a great time. Would definitely reccomend going here, especially with family it's a fun day ||November 30, 2013
0151jkjk||10||Absolutely awful today. This is my second time as the first was very enjoyable but I will not be returning ever again. It was grid lock inside, we were in a stand still que for nearly an hour as more people kept walking towards us. I feel this is a massive safety problem as there was very little crowd control who did nothing to help with the situation. I'm thankful that my children and I actually got out safely, something needs to be done before there is an awful accident!||November 30, 2013
bm3362||30||Our family attended the Hyde Park winterland today - glad we went as it's very festive, lots going on and the zippo circus was fantastic for the children. Lots of great places to enjoy food and drink.On the downside, the ice kingdom was a total waste of time and money, the winter wonderland was far too busy (although we did visit on a Saturday) and it was ridiculously expensive.Felt like calling 999 when we came out as it felt like we had been mugged. £16 for a family of 4 to enjoy a ride is a rip off.||November 30, 2013
Bobentrace||30||Went to Winter Wonderland on Saturday 22nd November Variety of stalls and rides, shops, eateries and bars could not be faulted but brace yourselves for a ridiculously expensive experience. Quite apart from the various pre bookable attractions which are really pricey, the rides at the attraction are bonkersly expensive. You buy tokens for the rides and £1 = 1 token. Then each of the rides has a token price. One of the rides in particular was 6 tokens per person. So for what was probably a 90 second ride, for a family of 4 would have been twenty four pounds. Additionally the food is extremely pricey. £3.50 for a corn on the cob when you can buy four in tesco for less than that. It's nice to get you in the Christmas spirit but unless you've ram raided a post office recently or you have the self control of a ninja, you will notice a rather enormous hole in your finances when you come out. There's over priced and then there's taking the ****. I'll leave you to decide which category Winter Wonderland falls into. Merry Christmas!||November 30, 2013
Dawn W||20||Sickeningly expensive, I work hard and earn a decent wage but even so, the prices were completely DISGUSTING. 7 pounds for one ride, food and drink grossly over priced and the circus was awful/boring/bad and felt very budget. I've seen some amazing circus type acts in the past and the circus should be embarrassed by their 'performance' it was laughable if it hadn't costed 12 each. The 'Knife thrower' was about 2 feet away from the board, I could have done it myself, blindfolded and drunk. The park and attractions were terribly signposted so that you walk around in circles and you can't get anywhere fast!! If you have a family, you might like to remortgage the house first!The few good points: It does have a nice atmosphere, which is exciting as it feels festive and fun, lots of rides from super scary to kids ones, good bars and music, lots of drink and food stalls.**Be warned, take cash with you as the two ATM queues are long and you get charged 2.95 for (slow) cash withdrawal, naturally. Also There are only a few toilets.||November 30, 2013
thomas_william75||40||Had a great day out with my 2 young children at winter wonderland. Rides were very good, for both young and older children. Some stalls to browse around. And some nice food, But cant believe the prices. It is very over priced and isn't a place to visit if you are on a budget. Rides are excessively expensive. The best rides were about £7 or £8 per person per ride!! Everything was overpriced. Food, stalls and entertainment. But regardless of spending far too much. It was fun and a day we would never forget.||November 29, 2013
violet339||40||I've been to Winter Wonderland a few years in a row now. I've always had a good time and I would definitely recommend it. I would say it's more of a fair than a Christmas market. There're a reasonable number of stalls and there are some nice things, but it doesn't really compare to the markets you get in Europe at this time of the year; you're really going to eat and drink and go on the rides. I had a bratwurst with sauerkraut in the Bavarian village (£5). It was nice, but not really hot enough. I also had two mulled wines (£8). I recommend the one in the Bavarian village called red Viking blood or something like that; my friend tried others as we went round and they didn't really compare. I didn't go on a ride this year, but I remember going on the zip wire last year (£15!) and the drop tower the year before that, which might have been £7 or £8. Both were a lot of fun (the zip wire isn't there this year). I think, if you plan on doing something similar, so getting a snack, a drink or two and going on a ride, it's affordable, but if you're planning on doing more than that, then you need to bring plenty of money with you. I went on a weekday this year, so there was plenty of room to walk around in and I felt very relaxed; in previous years, I've always gone at the weekend and I really wouldn't recommend it. I think it's nice to go in the afternoon and stay until it gets dark when the place looks quite different. The staff are nice and friendly; it's very well-organised and there're people collecting rubbish and wiping down tables all the time, so it's super clean and tidy. Having recently gone to a Bonfire night event at Alexandra Palace which was a complete and utter disaster, those guys could learn a lot from whoever is behind Winter Wonderland.||November 28, 2013
SaurabhSal||50||In winter I avoid going to parks but this winter wonderland is a magnet. This is the fourth year in a row that I am going. Right amount of rides, right amount of people. Perfect. Must vist before it gets under blanket of snow..||November 27, 2013
Ianeee||10||Went to Winter Wonderland today in Hyde Park with the family. What a total rip off. The rides were upto £7 per person. The food was so overpriced. All the rides were empty. Don't they realise if they reduce the price people would go on them.||November 27, 2013
Jacquie O||40||Great festive experience for all the family. We particularly liked the circus event and ice skating rink. The Magical Ice Kingdom was a little disappointing and extremely cold as you can imagine - make sure you wrap up really really well for that one!On the whole well worth a visit even if its just to walk around the German market.||November 26, 2013
Samantha D||10||My family and I have just come back from a trip to the hyde park winter wonderland? Oh dear! What a disappointment, I have a seven year old and a ten year old. It was so packed you couldn't freely walk anywhere which was quite scary for my 7 year old, the rides were incredibly expensive and some were ridiculously short. However my biggest concern was the amount of alcohol being consumed around children in Bavarian type bars, this is supposed to be a family event, we left at about 5.30pm I hate to think what it was like later! I booked for us all to go to the magical Ice Kingdom, which was the biggest let down, my girls were completely disinterested and the slide which was supposed to be the finale of the event was pathetic!! Vr very disappointed with the whole thing and not a place I will be taking children to again.||November 26, 2013
Littlecalfuk||30||There's two cafe's, I prefer the one at the far end (as I call it) its the other side of the lake not the one where you get the paddle boats. Apart from speakers corner near Marble arch (which can be quite entertaining at times and taking what they say with a pinch of salt), the lake with the boats, the two proper cafes, and a café type stand, the Princess Diana memorial (which I was disappointed with, but if you like that kind of architecture you'll love it), the band stand and the vast openness, its nothing special. Toilets are minimal. I like to walk through it from the March arch to knightsbridge, which doesn't take that long. I've picked a sandwich from Harrods and had myself a little picnic on a park bench. But I prefer it when its gone something going on like the Winter Wonderland at Christmas, its atmosphere is then buzzing. If you want to find the squirrels then my favourite place for this is St James Park.||November 25, 2013
Jeff P||50||I have to say, this is my favourite London park. There’s so much going on in and around it, yet at the same time it offers the green spaces in summer for sunbathing and general chilling out, right in the centre of London. Even visiting in early January is more than worthwhile.It covers 350 acres, and includes the Serpentine Lake, with its boat rentals, as well as the famous Speaker’s Corner, and more recently the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain.In addition to boating on the lake, park activities include swimming, tennis, biking and horse riding, as well, of course. as the informal soccer games, kite flying and tai-chi. There’s a great café right on the Serpentine, and plenty of places to eat all along the perimeter of the park.It also holds special events throughout the year, like Royal Gun Salutes and concerts.||November 25, 2013

One little guy climbed my jeans and peered into my coat pocket where I had some chocolate sweets. I missed getting a photograph of the little blighter with its head in my pocket and a tall waving to balance him.||November 25, 2013
DJ P||30||The park itself is lovely and nice for a stroll though but we went because of winter wonderland and was a bit of a rip off to be fair, I mean £4.50 for pork roll, burger or hot dog is just a joke for what u get and £2.50 for a can of fanta! Never again! We only did the Ice Kingdom was good in there and loved the sculptures but again disappointed that we paid £14 to walked though it in 10mins! Winter wonderland generally a RIP OFF!!||November 25, 2013
Ravinder D||30||We visited winter Wonderland on 24th December 201. There are only 2 memories you will have and they are 1) How much fun the kids had.It is truly a magical place with loads to do for the kids and adults. For families its best to visit during the day. However if going with friends then best to go in the evening. Seeing the light displays in the dark is beautiful. 2) How much your wallet was robbed of cash.There were 2 adults and 3 kids in my family. Each event or ride we visited costs anything between 20 – 35 pounds. I ended up paying close to 200 GBP for travlel into London, 2 events,2 rides each, food and drink.I think the organisers need to have a much more family friendly policy regarding cost, say like one off payment for everything.||November 24, 2013
samanthapanton||50||OMG, I was told it was good, it is amazing, We where delighted that our visit, was timed perfectly with the first weekend of the Winter Wonderland, It is our first visit and it did not disappoint. It is beautiful we spent about 5 hours there and only left as we had a train to catch to get home, but could have spent several more hours there, There is so much to see and it is so large, over 40 rides and attractions, food stalls galore and plenty of market stalls to browse and shop. From Dusk onwards it becomes even more magical. An absolute must,||November 24, 2013
juliedawnw||40||Just returned from winter wonderland only did the ice skating as short on time but it was perfect arrived early to avoid the rush .It is truly magical but some stalls are rather expensive .Any child would love it as I did and I'm a nannan you can make it as cheap or as expensive as you want.Would defo go again||November 24, 2013
michaelh206||50||This was our first time visiting Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. What a great surprise, it was jam packed with exciting things to do and the circus show was worth the £11.50 we paid to see it.I recommend going with a few friends on a weekend evening and spending a few hours in the Bavarian beer tent which was packed with people enjoying the live music and great beers and German food on offer. The rides are all great and there is more than plenty to keep the children amused for hours and hours. Do not miss out.||November 24, 2013
kendrafortune||10||Hyde Park itself is a lovely park, but there is nothing wonderful about Winter Wonderland. If the true meaning of Christmas is spending money you can't really afford for stuff you don't really need, then yes, Winter Wonderland embodies the true meaning of Christmas.To be fair, some of the stalls sell some quite nice stuff, but it was so busy that you just couldn't get near some of them. Crowds of people everywhere - I lost count of the number of times I got whacked round the head by people using the feet of children on their shoulders as battering rams to forge a path through the crowds (I'm not even exaggerating.) The fairground rides are exorbitantly priced. Yes, it's free to get in, but if you want to buy anything, eat anything or go on any of the rides then you will be paying a small fortune. There is nothing to look at (except for the stalls) that isn't going to cost you money and things like the Ice Kingdom and the Ice Rink needed to be pre-booked anyway. On the plus side, the cost of the rides keeps the queues relatively short.I ended the day feeling stressed and decidedly un-Christmassy - won't be returning!||November 23, 2013
873laurenb||50||Hyde Park is absolutely a must when in London. For the summer season the flowers are gorgeous. There is lots to do in the park such as renting a paddle boat or small rowing boats for an hour, have a picnic or simply hire a Boris Bike and just have a wonder around. My favourite part of the park is most definitely The Serpentine. Watching the geese is hilarious, especially the Egyptian geese they have such character.||November 23, 2013
Jennifer D||40||You cannot go to London and not visit Hyde Park. You can watch the swans on the Round Pond, or just wander beneath the trees, or visit the Prince Albert Memorial. It's all free and charge, and it's all lovely.The perfect place to rest and recuperate when you're weary from all your sight seeing, or shopping, or just life in general!||November 22, 2013
Brian-Snellgrove||50||I have many happy memories here stretching back over the years. I have seen firework displays, pop concerts, marathon runs, eccentric ice cream carts, lovely displays of spring flowers, and last but not least the biggest variety of happy relaxed visitors that you could wish to see.Try Sunday morning on a sunny day. Visitors to London, this city can be very wearing and Hyde Park is an oasis of calm. In the summer, you may hire a boat for rowing which is a very good therapy in itself. The brave and perhaps the fool hardy tend to swim at all times of the year in the swimming club area allocated for this purpose. There is an old British tradition of swimming on Christmas Day.Don't forget the Lady Diana Memorial which consists of running water which appears to go in two directions at the same time and is very beautiful.There is a very crowded restaurant to the east end of the lake which I suggest is avoided at peak times due to sheer overcrowding.Don't forget the speakers corner on Sunday morning but unfortunately its activities are much more muted than they have been in previous years. I must admit this is the one feature that I have not visited for some time.In the spring and summer there are lovely rose gardens in full bloom and the Royal Garden keepers make sure that the appearance is always as you would expect of a garden that has been established for so many years.There is a very good art gallery called the Serpentine adjacent to the Diana feature and is always worth a visit.I say this to visitors particularly from the United States, don't try to take all of London in in one go, you will not do it so why not spend a happy morning or afternoon wandering around, talking to people and unwinding. it might be a good way to do your recovery from jetlag on the first morning.||November 20, 2013
Shayna B||50||On our first day in London we wandered around Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens for about 2-3 hours. It was amazing how such a large, mature park could be in the middle of such a busy city! On a nice day there are tons of families, children, and couples having picnics, playing games, walking their dogs, and enjoying the beautiful park. This park made me fall in love with London!||November 19, 2013
Queencitas||50||Hyde Park is a cassic of London and of course you can´t miss it, even if you take a short stroll. The area around the pond, particularly, is beautiful. We were there during the summer and there weren´t as meny people as you might expect so it was very quiet. We took a four-hour nap (refreshing after a 12 hour flight), then were hungry when we woke up so we had a nice hot dog from a little shop by the pond. Loved this park!||November 18, 2013
Catriona_Brook||50||Got into London at about 7am, and after discovering that nothing really opens until 10am, we decided to wander around the park. It's a lovely place with lots of grassy areas for people and dogs alike, and a nice view of the river. It was teeming with bird life and squirrels. It's a nice place to kill time, especially if you don't want to spend money||November 18, 2013
905JoshP||10||We went a few days before christmas last year. No refunds for the ice rink covered in a bout 20cm of water so got cold wet feet. Ruined rest of the day. Stalls are not varied just all selling the same German limited foods. Gifts expensive. Rides £5 a go and staff unhelpful. There are many other places to go to get a good festive Christmas Day out. Advice organisers, get a cover for the ice rink it's going to be a wet christmas!||November 15, 2013
elizabeth b||50||had a great time totaly enjoy I would go back again and also I would recomende to friends.The place i very clean and well taken care of. the gift shops are expencive, also a food is pricy.lot of walking,beautiful scenery, clean facilyties It was a cloudy day, but Enjoyed a music and watching people come and go by. lot's action every where.

Jayne195811||30||A magical walk through the park to see The Winter Wonderland. I was there at opening time so less people around! Very overpriced for the fairground rides, so glad I didn't have children with me as it would be very expensive!The food was ok, a bit overpriced but what do you expect from London. I'm going agin this year though just to get the great atmosphere||November 13, 2013
1411Traveler||50||If you are planning your visit to London during the summer,, check the concert schedule. If an act is playing in Hyde Park outside,, you can hear them. Lovely area. We enjoyed the music, scenery, and people watching.||November 9, 2013
Emily908||50||My finance and I were in London for the weekend and decided to visit Hyde Park's Winter Wondeland.We arrived at around 5pm with the view to go out for dinner after a couple of hours in the Winter Wonderland.Dinner went COMPLETELY out the window!The lights and magic turned us into hyperactive overgrown children, we went on all the rides and played all the wonderful fair games such as coconut shy, shooting, archery etc.We had to ask for a bin liner to contain all the stuffed toys we had won!!We stopped at every bar, enjoying mulled wine and German beers and had a big German sausage for dinner. There was a fantastic 50's band at one bar and we couldn't help but get up and dance.All the stalls had high quality merchandise, we bought some souvenirs and Christmas decs from a few.We left around 10:45pm, a little drunk and our insides hurting from laughing so much.We thoroughly enjoyed being big kids and will return every year :D||November 5, 2013
karen a||50||We would like to park just outside or just inside London and catch a tube in to Hyde Park. We plan to go on a weekday in Nov or Dec but just don't have a clue where to park. We would come down the M11. Does anyone have any advice please?||November 3, 2013
Aleksandra P||50||Great for walking with a child on a sunny day. You may visit some playground, also there are few coffee houses where you can relax and enjoy a cup of hot drink.||November 3, 2013
G_Inspector||40||Romantic walk i would say, lovley place to see for the first time., very clean and many people walking, taking boat rides and cafes on water||November 2, 2013
Jpgraham||50||we raced in the World Triathlon Age Group Championships in Hyde Park so saw a lot of the park. Rent a Barklay's bike, have a swim in the Serpentine, a latte at the cafe or a stroll. You will feel renewed !||November 2, 2013
Masood S||50||It is really a good place to spend time. There are so many attractions incl. Big play ground for kids. Area that you can play football etc. skating also has it own area.||November 1, 2013
christine t||50||We visited Hyde two times in the week we were in London and enjoyed it both times. The Italian garden, The Fountain to Princess Dianna, Kensington Gardens, Kensington Palace, all the statues, the birds in the Serpentine Creek it was a real pleasure to stroll around the park. We had lunch at the restaurant near Princess Diana's fountain and it was very enjoyable. Two Bobbies walking through the park were happy to have their photo taken with me.It should be a must for all tourists.||October 27, 2013
Kimmeea||50||I go to Winter Wonderland every year in December as it really gets you in the Festive mood! First year we booked a restaurant to eat in, not knowing how everything was set out, though since then we just eat where we fancy on the day as there are so many options. Our favourite is now the noodle station! We are usually bitter cold so make sure you wrap up warm! We go ice skating every time, its well set up, if you're late they still let you on for the remainder of the time and is really fun. Unfortunately we get told we can't take pictures while on the ice (we sneak a few in ) but as all of us are skating it would be nice to be able to take some ourselves. The ice kingdom is great to see, but as it is so cold in there, once is enough when there is nowhere to warm up!I think this is a great day out at christmas and I love the christmas market and all the festive food and drinks and the snow machines, its a great atmosphere!||October 25, 2013
al3xand3rth3g8||50||Nice place I have good memories with this parkSpecially I love the tree in Hyde parkI climbed into the top with my bestfriend Angela and my girlfriend She make videos and photos for usLove you sweetie||October 24, 2013
Sue F||50||We stayed near hyde park so we visited and used it as a thoroughfare every day. Its a beautiful park and large open space for such a densly populated city. The cafe at serpentine lake is nice. Rather than the restaurent menu we preferred the fresh baguettes, cakes and coffees and then sat in the deck chairs outside enjoying the lake views and wildlife. Lido cafe looks lovely too . So many areas to explore , dont miss italian fountains and kensington gardens and palace||October 24, 2013
Ladymais||50||It is a perfect place to walk and sit . Alot of people , the speaker corner , the serpentine cafe . All the park worth going all around times and times .||October 22, 2013
FizzyLife||40||This is a fantastic place to relax in and enjoy the surroundings and the wildlife. Not so sure about the cafes but in the good weather take your own!!||October 19, 2013
davidrusseleg||40||A very nice place to walk, read or have a picnic if London weather is nice. a variety of activities can be done, it's free and it is in the middle of London, so you can plan stuff before and after in case the weather changes||October 18, 2013
Lauren R||50||The park has a nice running loop which will allow you to see all the major sights around the park. You can see Kensington palace, marble arch, the Princess Diana memorial and much more. If you aren't a runner, rent a Boris bike and have a little spin around. Definitely worth it!||October 17, 2013
DarkScarlett||50||My partner and I chilled in Hyde park for a little while before making our way on to Harrods.It was nice to just lay there on the grass (Like the locals) after walking for ages.We then went for a stroll, people watched and saw some Squirrels! (I loooooooovvvveee squirrels)||October 14, 2013
Judy L||40||Very big & it is so beautiful in the sunset moment! The sky, the cloud, the trees, the lake, the duck & the pigeon are so beautiful & lovely.You can breathe the fresh air, releasing here, it is really good to take a walk in the morning or evening. Lovely place!||October 14, 2013
tykerk||40||This is a large park near Paddington. You can do anything you like here. Have a picnic, go for a walk, walk the dog, and ride a horse. We walked through here in morning a couple times. The Diana memorial fountain is also located in here. ||October 14, 2013
ellebee_x||50||Huge, lovely park with lots to see and explore. We especially like the Italian fountains and the wildlife. ||October 13, 2013
Megi68||50||It is a huge and very nice park. It's close to Buckingham Palace and some other London attractions.There is a lake (the Serpentine) in the park and it's nice to walk around it, rent a pedal boat or kayak. There are so many lounge chairs to take a rest and enjoy the sun. The park is very clean and peaceful. There is a monument and fountain in the memory of late Lady Di. The park is contiguous with Kensington Gardens.||October 13, 2013
TravelGirl317||50||What a lovely park! Nice pathways and sidewalks, beautiful gardens and convenient cafes. You can almost picture horses and carriages running around as if it's the 19th century again. I got lucky as the day I was there the weather was nice and it was not very crowded. Take a snack and enjoy!||October 10, 2013
Petr S||50||Every time I visit Hyde park (or any other London park) I am in never-ending awe.How can they keep it so clean? No buts or other rubbish on the ground, no chewing gums stuck on the benches and the grass, oh the grass! Lay anywhere you like and seize the day.||October 10, 2013
Gary07734||40||Hyde Park is huge, well maintained and close to plenty of other attractions such as Knightsbridge, Marble Arch, Buckingham Palace etc. Pleasant for a stroll and quiet enough to get away from the rest of manic London.||October 9, 2013
Bob V||50||My wife and I walked through the park twice, after a while it's hard to believe your in the middle of the city, well kept and sign posted and the toilets spotless, a credit to all the staff||October 8, 2013
Zafer_dikmen||50||What a chance if the weather is shining. Yes it was when we were there. You can have take away from pret a manger at the corner close to underground and enjoy your breakfast in the park. Lovely to relax in sunny sunday. ||October 7, 2013
Nihaar C||50||The difference is striking, walking through one of the gates from the noise and pace of London into the park was amazing I already felt relaxed, it was a nice day the park was busy but I didn't feel crowded, it was great to see people of all walks just enjoy this emerald of green amongst granite that is London. ||October 6, 2013
D H||50||This is a very comfortable and HUGE park! If you want to just sit and read a book, people watch, jog, skate, or enjoy something nice to eat, this is the place for you! It is very clean and everyone is respectful. There are even boats that you can rent and paddle out on the lake for a little exercise or just to have a romantic interlude. During the summer, there are often bands playing and rides to get on in the northwest corner of the park. People are seen biking, walking, picnicking, or just hanging out and this is a GREAT place to do just that!||October 6, 2013
NicoNL78||30||Wasnt much about Hyde Park. Sure its a nice big lawn in the city but wasnt blown away. Perhaps its alot better when there is an event but other than that it is just grass.||October 6, 2013
Jeffrey P||50||This and Kensington Gardens were my favorite places to strollLots to see, benches everywhere. Dogs playing, majestic trees and fountains.Kensington Palace, Diana Fountain......on and on.....||October 5, 2013
AdysWorld||50||Visited this park during my recent visit to London. This park is huge so decided to explore from the Hype Park Corner station and it was lovely exploring through the park. Amazing weather, beautiful flower, greenery and friendly pigeons added to the beauty. Sitting on the bench and watching into the nature, is the best feeling one can have after a busy day in the streets of London.||October 5, 2013
Seafoodtraveler||50||My son and I recently rented some Barclay's Rental Bikes to take a ride through Hyde Park.Given the size of the park and the wonderful bike trails this was a great and relaxing way to spend a Sunday afternoon.The bikes are easy to rent and easy to ride.Highly recommended.||October 4, 2013
jameshuang||40||Everybody woke up early in the morning and was eager to explore the city of London. When we rushed to the underground station, we found the ticket machine had problem taking credit cards. Fortunately, we still had some cash to buy 8 one-day passes for the group. We got off at Hyde Park Corner station and entered the park via a classical style gateway designed in 1825 near the two pairs and two single gates of forged stainless steel and bronze Queen Elizabeth Gate. We were lucky to see a carriage led by two horses just like those seen in the old day movies. Not far after we passed the path that shared with cyclists, we saw the Rose Garden. It had not only the roses but also shrubs and herbaceous flowers. We passed the Boy and Dolphin statue while entering the garden, but the dolphin looked more like a big fish. On the left is a fountain with the bronze figure of the Greek goddess shooting an arrow. The flowers were so beautiful when we visited in early July.We did not have breakfast, so we decided to have some light brunch at the Serpentine Bar & Kitchen on the lakeside of Serpentine. The Serpentine in Hyde Park and the Long Water in Kensington Garden was created by Queen Caroline in 1726-1730. The restaurant is a nice place to watch the water birds. We saw swans with their babies, ducks and some unknown birds. After the light lunch, we went along the path with the lake on our right. We spent some time photographing on the wildlife in the lake. The water birds also created annoying side effect – guano all over the shore. Before we approached the Lido, I saw a man feeding birds on his palm. It required patience and skill for the birds to come for food. The Lido and clock tower were built in 1930 as a changing room and is now a restaurant. Lido Cafe Bar has waterside tables and is the ideal place to enjoy a snack or a glass of cold drink in the hot summer day. We ended up at Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain. It is a place for people to remember the good things that Diana brought to us. We did not cross the Serpentine Bridge but continued our travel to the next door - Kensington Gardens. If you visit Hyde Park, you must spare some time to discover Kensington Gardens and its Italian Gardens at the end of The Long Water Lake.London residents are so lucky to have many big gardens and parks in the center of London. Hyde Park is one of the eight Royal Parks in London; it covers 350 acres and has famous landmarks such as the Serpentine Lake, Speakers' Corner and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain. I certainly will come back again to visit the other side of the Serpentine Lake sometime in the future.||October 4, 2013
mrpdxs_12||40||My husband and I decided to walk through the park after our visit to the Museum of Natural History. The weather was perfect for a nice stroll and it was nice to get away from the traffic.We walked past the Diana memorial- nothing spectacular, but it was peaceful. There were places to eat in the park, but we did not partake while there.||October 4, 2013
rollergirl52||50||After a hectic few days in London sightseeing, on our last day we decided to hire bikes and cycle through Hyde Park. It was a beautiful sunny day and though it was a hassle getting the bikes free from their locking stations with big queues of tourists trying to figure out how to work the machines, it was worth it in the end. In all the years I have been visiting London, I couldn't believe I had hardly been to Hyde Park! It was amazing to think that this amazing space was just a short walk from the madness of Oxford Street.The first thing we saw which took my breath away was the Horse Guards from the Palace in full regalia walking their horses by the park. We cycled all round the lake, stopping to take pictures and admire the views and stopped for food and drink at one of the cafes. People were cycling and walking all around with families playing and picnicking on the grass and people were taking boats out on the water.We stopped by the Princess Diana Memorial Garden and saw lots of children playing in the stream which was lovely. The whole park is so nice and beautifully kept with some nice wildlife, it's a beautiful oasis away from the bustle of central London. It's a wonderful place to experience some peace in the city and a great way to do it is by hiring a bike. The Barclays bikes are sturdy and easy to ride and good value too. Don't know why I have never taken the time to explore Hyde Park before - it is stunning.||October 3, 2013
loganc156||50||My wife and I visited Hyde Park as we were walking from our hotel to the Big Ben/London Eye area. We were pleasantly surprised to run into Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park. It was very fun and I enjoyed the Bavarian Village most of all. Nothing better than a beer and a brat. It truly felt like Christmas had arrived! The great monuments and peaceful park scenery made this an enjoyable trip through the park.||October 1, 2013
Snarth||40||Hyde Park is a terrific way to escape the noise of the city, if only for a little while. Beautiful trees and flowers and an amazing variety of birds, including pelicans! We enjoyed watching the kids and the wildlife challenging one another. There are squirrels that will eat out of your hands, and mad terriers rushing at the squirrels and the pigeons. Definitely worth a stroll if not a detour.||September 30, 2013
arif k||50||this has to be the most amazing green space in the world,sorrounded by the best shopping,eateries and transport links in london,the serpentine lake,speakers corner on a sunday morning and the royal horse guards riding through in full kit,kensington palace and harrods at one end and selfridges at the other,just so much history with marble arch where public hanging and execution took place not so long ago, as a roundabout for traffic and buckingham palace at the edges of the green,now also has the memorial play stream for princess diana and the bandstand from olden days that is still used,so much going on yet you can kick your shoes off and have a quiet reflective rest and snooze while the world bustles along a stones throw away.perfect,so near yet so far away feeling in the middle of one of the most elite,busiest,crowded placeson the planet.have to be there to see to believe your eyes and senses.most recommended if you are in the west end out shopping and need a breath of fresh air and calm your nerves.||September 30, 2013
AndrewS666_666||30||We went to Hyde Park today and we were very underwhelmed. First they charged you just to sit down . We thought we had left that behind at the beaches in Italy. At least there you had a view of the water and could swim. There was no view of anything just a large expanse of grass with absolutely nothing to look at. There was a lake and some fountains. A very ordinary park by world standards. The squirrels were good though.||September 30, 2013
DanielChengYOSHI||50||This is truly an amazing park---whether you're going for a stroll or jog!!! I stayed at the hotel nearby-- which is also closed to Heathrow Airport, and very convenient for dining. So I can go jogging when I get up, then buy breakfast back to hotel: what can you ask for a better life?||September 29, 2013
Katieceebee||50||I have been to Hyde park for many reasons.-Group drinking sessions,-Roller-blading-Feeding the ducks-Lie in the summer sunThe list goes on.It can sometimes get crowded but just walk a bit further in and you'll be sure to find a peaceful spot.Very well maintained and I love going there!||September 29, 2013
travelnut600||10||We have been going to proms for the last 5 years with a group of friends-it was so bad this year from start to finish, we have all decided it was our last proms. The SS at the gates restricting your booze-health and safety my foot. only want you to queue up for hours and buy their rip off prices booze. the acts were awful,mumbling Dame Edna and Terry passing time with their aimless crap talk,Mr Ferry sounding like a karaoke session and by the time the grand exit performance started we were so cold and bored,we couldn't wait to be kettled out with the masses. The queus for the hot drinks were soooo long.No big screens towards the back and the usual one or two blocks of dirty bogs. Never again,the Hampton Court festivals are so much better for the same price.||September 28, 2013
Ninazee||50||The park is so big and it is so nice and relaxing to walk around it. All of the different gardens and memorials to visit are interesting. I was surprised that the Princess Di memorial was not so easily accessible from the south path of the park. You can tell that everyone else was too because there are paths in the grass around the fence to get to the entrance. The fountains are simple, elegant and very moving. There were several families there playing around it. I think that would make her happy.||September 27, 2013
Anne-Thomson||40||London without its parks would be unimaginable. Those green oases filled with peace, charm, history and glorious nature. Hyde Park is the largest with impressive trees. A bicycle is a good idea however a friend and I chose to walk the dogs via Kensington Gardens and then refreshments at the Serpentine, which made for lovely early morning breaks. Some interesting art displays, bird life and flowers in the changing seasons means that there is always something new to see.A great deal of London borders on Hyde Park - so it provides that green access to ... be it Kensington Palace with historic displays, Hype Park corner or Knightsbridge, or the Royal Albert Hall.||September 26, 2013
Danilo M||50||A very nice park to visit... However, If you dont hide a bicycle, it becomes very difficult to circle around it, so it is highly recommended that you do so||September 25, 2013
juliahar2||50||We had already been out for Lunch but it was a beautiful September Afternoon and didnt want to just waste the time - so we literally put our Walking shoes on and Walked from our Hotel _The Kensington Hotel - Queens Gate - We walked around Kensington Gardens where the Sunken Garden was around the Round Pond and toward the Long Water and The Sepentine - it was nice too stroll and take all the people, dogs and everyone just enjoying the sunshine. Plenty of fountains and things to look at or just watch the World go by!! We ended up back at the little cafe at the Serpentine - we didnt even know that existed until last year at the 2012 Olympics as that was where they swam for the Open Water swim for the Triathalon? But someone was eating foor they had ordered from the Cafe and it looked very good too!! Then we walked towards back towards Knightsbridge (Harvey Nicks and Harrods ) The good thing with London you can get around quite easily walking when its beautiful weather||September 25, 2013
bobzan||40||Lotsa of ducks & geese, ? plus swans this time! Wanted to find a cafe with new view but the good seats were all taken. It was still cool & peaceful to sit on the grass ? with the geese sunbathing near u too! Hyde park is certainly one of the best park we have viewed in London, if not the best!||September 24, 2013
TaherAlbaghliJulian||20||Hyde Park is one of the largest parks in central London, and one of the Royal Parks of London, famous for its Speakers' Corner for people who speak & argueIt big park it nice but not beautiful or amazing like central park or princess garden or Tiergarten , I think this garden need multicolor flowers , more tress & full the naked area by grass or flowers . when i walk in Hyde park i fell uncomfortable especially marble arch for speaks area ifell negative energy in spite of i like lake area it cool especially with ducks,pigeon & goose..they hire boat , i like drink & eat in this area.also the bridge nice i love the flower & the grass in the bridge.you can also rent a horse for jogging .i do not like this park||September 24, 2013
Jane S||50||A great park, perfect for a long stroll but with something for everybody! Walking, cycling, dog walking, lots of space for every body. Look out for the wild parrots!||September 23, 2013
AthinaM_Al||50||How could anyone not like it? It is a vast park, with amazing greenery, nice paths for bikes, pedestrians and horses and even has its own river! You can pedal in the river (which very fun, but remember to use sunblock if it's sunny) and I tried and it turned out very nice. It's a paradise in the center of London, with nice birds and ducks and squirrels..and just so much to see! It's very nice just to talk a simple walk through there, not essentially tour it all over. It refreshes you, with all its tall trees and ever-running fountains. A must-see of London.||September 23, 2013
tim m||50||what can i say, its absolutley beautiful. we went for the winter wonderland and cant wait to go again in a couple of months. loads to do whatever age you are, different rides, loads of gorgeous food to choose from, (we had a german sausage and crepes for pudding, yum,) loads of bars, great stalls, the list goes on. yes mulled wine is £4 but its in a prime area in london, with beautiful surroundings but its well worth it. there is also a bar on a working carousel which is really cute, just dont have too many of those mulled wines as you may struggle to get off! we go early morning/ afternoon and its not overly busy, though later at night i would imagine it does get pretty full, also wrap up warm as there arent many places around where you can take shelter if its cold and wet. if you arent feeling christmassy and you are near london, come here, you will be glad you did||September 23, 2013
ANMW14||50||We walked to Hyde Park from Buckingham Palace and it was a short, refreshing distance to cover, so I would recommend that you fit it in with the other touristy bits. I've always wanted to visit Hyde Park, especially to see the Serpentine, as it has featured in so many books that I've read. It is a wonderful, quaint park with several different paths to follow. We decided to pay for a pedalo on the Serpentine as a way to pass the time. For £12 each we had an hour on the water and it was very relaxing. If the weather is decent, I would highly recommend this as the views were decent and we really enjoyed it. There's lots of wildlife in the park, including swans, various species of ducks/water birds and squirrels to name a few. All want you to feed them and will come up to you if you let them. It's a good place to pass the time and it's something different to the usual tourist traps in the city. I'll definitely be back.||September 22, 2013
Harry430||40||Brillant during the Winter Wonderland, although the rides are pricey, but this is London so nothing unusual there! Nice place to visit all year round.||September 21, 2013
Cappuccino-fields||40||The biggest park in central London and one of London’s eight Royal Parks, Hyde Park opened in 1637.With plenty of wide open green space to go for a walk or relax in on a sunny day, the park is divided by the Serpentine, a recreational lake. Rowing & pedal boats are available and you can swim too from june to september. Restaurants, Cafes and free public toilets can be found in the park.Generally not mentionned, London parks are great places to spot squirrels. They are not afraid of humans at all & usually get pretty close hoping to be fed.Near the Marble Arch entrance, you’ll find The speakers’ Corner, where every sunday, anyone can speak their mind on any subject. Extreme religious or political views, conspiracy theories and the likes make this a London attraction in itself. Whether you find it interesting or absurb, it’s worth a visit.Hyde Park also hosts numerous events, from famous rock concerts to Winter Wonderland during the winter holiday season.The park opens throughout the year from 5 am to midnight. Although contiguous with Kensington Gardens, they are separate parks and open/close at different times.Located in the city of Westminster. Get off at underground stations Marble Arch, Hyde Park Corner or Knightsbridge.You can check out lots of pictures here : http://cappuccinofields.com/2013/09/19/london-parks-hyde-park/||September 19, 2013
Mike R||40||Worth going to see, many runners pass by however the scenery is lovely and peaceful. Good spot for a picnic lunch or a read. ||September 12, 2013
DOOSTAM||50||The park is huge and in the heart of London. It is so big that one feels lost in it. It has a lake and some beautiful gardens. There are boat rides in the lake. Nice place to relax and enjoy with family specially children.||September 12, 2013
lauren s||50||My husband and I stayed in a hotel across the street from Hyde Park. On our first afternoon, we decided to take a quick walk across the street and see what the park had to offer. We wound up getting "lost" in the park for hours. The gardens are beautiful. We sat by the lake and had a cup of tea - we watched street performers - watched people flying kites - saw beautiful fountains and monuments. It was such a pleasant surprise and I would love to spend another day meandering through this park. A definite must see!||September 11, 2013
asho212||50||Great lineup in great location with great crowd. Took own food in so didn't experience that. Drinks ok for location. ||September 11, 2013
Nigel A||50||Atmosphere and great artists. Friendliness other festival goers, facilities were excellent and would definitely go again||September 10, 2013
Gilvam||50||Yes.. it's big! I walked from Green Park almost crossing all Hyde Park. Me and my wife stopped for a hot dog and watched everyone around. Summer time is nice so you can see people out playing.||September 9, 2013
brkench||40||So pretty and peaceful. Very clean, but occasionally got the smell of bins! Sat at the Lido Cafe, and enjoyed a cup of tea and cake by the water. ||September 9, 2013
Pinksteph369||50||Its a Must if you go to London in the summer try and catch last night of the Proms in Hyde Park.the show starts at 5.30 but it's best to getvthere at three when the gates open to find agood place.do not go near the places selling food ..you get stuck in the queues for food that swell to alarming performances all through the early evening and well into the show.try and get midway between the screens over to the right ended up the best place.we were trapped in the queue for the Sausage Shack and The BUrrito stall,suddenly realising that we had amass of continually moving people all around so get out of that area!brilliant show made evn better by Dame Edna!!Joseph Calajo was amazing as was Nigel Kennedy and Brian Ferry,the Let it Be cast really livened up the whole show.||September 8, 2013
Jan P||50||The use of the park by so many yet it was still peaceful. Walked around the Princess Diana memorial fountain, and the serpantine and all was wheelchair friendly. ||September 8, 2013
191PaulB||50||Hyde Park is such a magnificent facility in the middle of London. In many places you simply can't see anything but grass and trees, not the normal background of high rises. Our latest visit was for a concert celebrating the Last Night of the Proms. Good venue in a corner of the park and great fun. Although must remember that the nights in September can be quite cold.||September 8, 2013
utjacie||40||They have like this squirrels or chipmunks and they are to die for, literally! So cute! And the park is so so big, you can reach it from all places and at summertime it's really nice to hang out there.||September 8, 2013
kamiliakk||50||if you love princess Diana you have to come here; she jogged here every day she was in her nearby residence. There are also several memorials for her in the park. It is also the hangout for Arabs in the summer around the serpentine ( what remains of an old river that passed through London and is now more of a lake)Bring lots of bread to feed the ducks and pelicans.||September 8, 2013
Amna1976||50||you can't be in London without visiting Hyde park of course .. though I lived there for long .. but it's the second time I'm walking in the park during this vacationspecially for Middle Easterns .. this is a very cool place if you wish to be away from noisy places .. walking .. cycling .. taking pictures .. or simply sitting there and relaxing .. a very pleasant retreat for sometime off ..||September 6, 2013
Sandy5611||40||Hyde Park is combined with Kensington Gardens a huge park area in London city. Great for a walk or other ways of relaxation. I realy liked the speakers' corner. This is a must-see, or better: you should walk and listening to all speakers and their audience. Something special.||September 6, 2013
DesireeCMentor||50||Our hotel (The Cumberland) is located opposite Hyde Park, London. It is very relaxing and tranquil just to sit in the Park. Very busy, especially during lunch hour as many people come to relax their during theiir lunch hour. Very big Park - it is better to "break - up" the visits to the Park unless you are super fit.Recommend having a picnic lunch in the Park, it is awesome. ||September 6, 2013
Kyle S||40||An absolutely great escape from the hustle and bustle of London. You could easily lose yourself for a day in here, if not much longer.If you only have a day or two in London it's not a "must see", but if you're there for any longer duration of time it's a fantastic way to break up the cavalcade of sights and sounds of the city and escape for a few moments of peace and quiet in a beautiful space.||September 6, 2013
proudMom2012||50||Hyde Park is one of the most beautiful ( and Famous) of London Parks. It is a massive vast of green grassy lawn, walk paths, lakes, and natural in all its surroundings. It has lots of walking paths where people jog daily while listening to their ipods, bicycles have a special lane , even horses have a walking area! You see many people riding their horses in here at times.There are different types of gardens in one really, you have the hugely open vast one, when you see family ball games or people picnicking ( people of all nationalities), then you have specific areas more dense and with lots of trees, here you will find squirrels popping in front of you for food. Pleasant walking experiences, you also have Fountain Place which is a sitting area around a fountain of course, very relaxing and toilet facilities are plenty. You then have another larger area (some little rolling hills) and a very large lake where you feed the ducks and see them in groups 'sailing' by... very cute sight indeed. You also have restaurants surrounding the lake and lots of benches. Here it is common to see skate boarders bicyclists, people on roller skates and people from all walks of life in their national costumes.There are fast food stalls near the waterside, and you can go for paddle boat rides ( a fee for this). Many families are here , mothers with strollers too. In the surrounding area just outside Hyde Park, there are many apartment buildings of various prices, one side might be classy and expensive and another you will find cheaper.. Hyde park is that big! There are also a variety of shops and souvenir shops just across the road, great restaurants can be seen very close too. Crossing the road is no problem as you have a tiny zebra crossings, and it is so easy to return back to the park if you wish too.Every Saturday or Sunday , there is the "Speaker Corner" Day where some people will stand on a box and speak out what they have on their minds no matter what it is-some hilarious things happen there! Lots of public events go on there like concerts etc, lots happening so never a boring moment! Definitely a beautiful atmosphere and late mornings and early afternoons are the best times to go.The great thing is about Hyde Park, you can plan to spend your time there, go out and shop nearby and meet lots of people.Tips:* Take some snacks and drinks if you don't want to buy any there... mind you, you will be tempted!* Take a chair or blanket to sit down or for picnics.* Take a camera to catch those special moments of the ducks near the lake, the pigeons flying down on you after food, and all the scenery!*Take some wet wipes or disinfectant wipes, they always come in handy.* Take a foldable shopping bag , just in case you do go across the road to shop.* Take dry or stale bread pieces with you for the ducks, snacks for the squirrels too.||September 5, 2013
Margaret842||50||Walk, run or sit in a deckchair, a great place to relax after all the sightseeing. You can take a trip round the lake or hire a boat and paddle yourself. Places to eat or grab a cuppa and plenty of benches to sit on and watch the world go by.||September 5, 2013
Virginia C||40||It was lovely to walk through this park, though we did think it could have been better signposted. The trees and the water Area were magnificent and everyone wandering around the park was interesting. We were just walking through to somewhere but it would be lovely for a picnic or just a chill out.||September 5, 2013
2kidsmum939||40||Went to this park with our children, they really enjoyed paddling in the Diana Memorial quite a few children doing same. Went to cafe on waters front, nice location. Only downside couldn't find new Diana Playground or signs to tell us. Serpentine full of ducks, swans and Canada geese children loved the baby ones. Lovely morning spent here. ||September 4, 2013
Wanderlust_187||50||I visited Hyde Park and the area called Speakers Corner was full of people having a peaceful protest, it was a site to see so many people with shared beliefs in a large beautiful park.||September 3, 2013
OfficiallyForeign||50||On Sunday mornings you can see a big group of people heatedly discussing world-views and religion. Very interesting. Also, great place on a nice day to hire a lawn chair and people-watch. Loved watching the groups of roller skaters. ||September 3, 2013
StellaJenny||50||Ducks, paddle boats, play area, fun water feature, cafés and more, Wish we had a park like this at home.||September 3, 2013
Masha H||20||Ugly park! Long distance walk with few trees scatters around the park. If you don't have much time in London, don't waste your time here but go to Saint James Park instead.||September 3, 2013
wirawiri||30||Went around this legendary well knowned and famous park, I felt upset because it was likely bad handed. Graffity and rubbish was everywhere. It could be a wrong time to enjoy . ||September 3, 2013
SheriBobLove2Travel||40||Unlike Central Park this park does not feel crowded. There are many trails and great sites throughout the park. Ponds and great places to just sit and people watch. Nice place to take a break from the busy city. Beautiful gardens throughout the park. Near Paddington.||August 31, 2013
Ruth W||50||We visited the park as a bit of light relief from the city, it was a hot day, treated ourselves to a good walk around and found ice creams, boat trips, children playground and many ducks, geese and swans. We took a visit to the Princess Diana Memorial Park which the children found great to be able to walk in the water. It was very busy as you would expect. Worth a visit to experience the great outdoors in the middle of London!||August 31, 2013
TillyChapman||50||A fantastic event - well organised ice skating, many lovely stalls and food stands - great atmosphere - we'll be going back every year!!||August 30, 2013
ShirleyMiddlesex||50||What better way to spend a sunny afternoon than to take a leisurely stroll through Hyde Park and then relax in a deck chair beside the Serpentine. The park is so huge and beautifully laid out and free for everyone to enjoy. Just go.||August 29, 2013
mrsfussy3||50||This park is huge. It has of course been the venue for huge music concerts and gatherings of all sorts. It is nice to enjoy the trees and some greenery away from the busyness of the city.||August 27, 2013
ShellSammut||40||We visited the park on a Sunday, so it was quite busy but that didn't bother us. We ended up hiring bicycles (note that there are a few hire places around the park but they can get quite busy) but it was the best way the see this huge park.||August 26, 2013
Fareooz||50||Was very sunny, it is an amazing walk, loads of places to sit and have ice cream. Lots of squirrels who come right up to you, they are very used to people. This was such a fun thing to do, we walked from Lancaster gate to the the Albert Memorial (which is Kensington gardens) then onward through Hyde park. We walked all the way to the palace and beyond. Just a really nice walk, very romantic.||August 26, 2013
BEVNorthEast_England||40||The day we visited this park it was glorious hot weather. We sat next to the Diana memorial water fountain. We had a lovely picnic. Peace and quiet in the city.||August 25, 2013
AFreel85||50||Spent about three hours walking around Hyde Park at the end of July...the weather was fabulous and the park was full of people having picnics.There are some nice cafes around the park and its definitely a must do in London.||August 24, 2013
viajandomundial||50||London is a city you can say located within the parks. Hyde Park is a true example of a civilized country||August 24, 2013
NickP697||30||Went there for a walk and sit down while on a day out. Deck chairs available for £1.50/hr, £7.50 for the day. Not bad but pricey if a few of you. The park seemed to have quite a bit of rubbish on he grass areas but noticed hardly any bins. The lake is great but o enjoy it to its max, it's going to cost out. To rent a pedalo or a boat you need deep pockets and long arms. Basically, £29 for four people you use either for one hour. That put me right off. I know London is expensive but didn't count on it being that expensive. However I did notice not one English person in the queue. From the accents and languages spoken it was full of foreign tourists. Nothing like ripping off visitors but then no one is forcing them to pay. And nearly £3 for a cup of tea. Walk one minute out the park and get one from Costa/Starbucks for half the price. If you just want to relax in the sun, great. If you want to do some activities, drink and eat, make sure you do some overtime before you go.||August 23, 2013
Fionainparis||40||Assuming you're not already worn out from walking around London, then Hyde Park is a very large open space with mostly grassy expanses, few floral parts, lots of established trees, a big lake with water foul and even an enclosed kids play ground. If your kids need to run, kick a ball, fly a kite, chase pigeons, etc. then this is the place to go in London. It is adjacent to Kensington Gardens with its Diana Memorial Playground (fantastic place). The Albert Memorial is here too plus a number of fancy wrought iron gates and stone masonry arches celebrating various people/events. If you're on a bike, then note that some of the pathways are pedestrian only.||August 22, 2013
Ljjema||50||Walking through Hyde Park - was a hot summers day. The squirrels were friendly to us coming forward to say hello. We saw a pelican and lots of wildlife. Sat in the sunshine with ice cream and a waffle with ice cream. Not cheap but average for London||August 21, 2013
HESLondon||40||Obviously decent weather helps, but there is something for everyone in Hyde Park. Enjoyed a lovely Saturday strolling through the park, visiting the Princess Diana memorial, having lunch al fresco at the Lido and watching people swimming, running, rollerblading, cycling, horse riding, sitting in the sun or boating on the Serpentine. There is also a great playground for those with smaller children. You can take advantage of the various refreshment stands scattered throughout or keep the cost down and take your own. Great day out. So lucky to be a Londoner!||August 20, 2013
KevSuzuki||50||Lucky for me I work just around the corner from here, the park is always well kept and is a lovely place to walk and just spend time with friends and family. When your here you wouldn't really know your in a busy city at all.||August 20, 2013
osulaw75||50||I have been going to this park for years. In fact, I can't imagine going to London and not having visits to this park as part of my trip. What a beautiful oasis in the middle of a city! There is plenty to do for everyone. If you are a bike rider, jogger, or roller skater, there are long paths for you to use. If you want to exercise your horse, there are dirt roads to accommodate your needs. I especially like it when the royal horsemen come through. At my age now, I enjoy the tranquility. There are numerous benches throughout the park grounds, along Serpentine Lake, etc. The park is full of docile squirrels, ducks, geese, etc. who have perfected "free hand outs" from the tourists. I have seen several pictures being taken by amused tourists when a particular animal or fowl is eating out of their hands. The flowers beds and grounds are kept up constantly and I love the rose garden area when it is the proper season. I've taken many pictures there. Drinking a cup of coffee in a tranquil rose garden and just watching the people come through can be a relaxing event. Of course, there is the Diana Memorial, Kensington Palace, and even rock concerts in this park from time to time. For me, just strolling through this beautiful place and sitting on a bench taking everything in is always a high point of my London trips.||August 19, 2013
chocolocomama||40||We spent a few hours here late yesterday afternoon/early evening. The park was very, very busy and it was disappointing to see how much rubbish had been left lying around by the Serpentine. It's such a lovely park that it's a shame some people can't seem to clear up after themselves. Speakers corner was very rowdy and a bit intimidating but worth a walk through.||August 19, 2013
Gardenhopper||50||It is easy to rent and drop the bicycles around London. Cycling in Hyde Park gave us a chance to enjoy the gardens and cover more ground than we could on foot. It also allowed us to cycle without worrying about avoiding buses and traffic. The gardens are beautiful and the trails are easy to negotiate.||August 19, 2013
SandyG07||50||We hired a bike for a couple of hours and rode through Hyde Park. This was so much fun. It was so much easier to get around as Hyde Park is very big and walking around would take you quite a while. We saw all the sights within this time including Princess Diana's Memorial and Kensington Palace. A must do!||August 18, 2013
S O||40||Well, go on a sunday morning and you will find speakers corner.Hire of roller blades as well to try and get the hang of.You will find deck-chairs to chill out.The serpentine lake if you want to jump in a pedaloe for a paddle or have a drink by the water.A quiet spot in the middle of London's west end.||August 18, 2013
SunDancerIII||50||Lots and lots to do....From relaxing in the shade on a deck chair which by the way is £4/5 to hire per chair for 3 hours; to 30 minutes cycling on one of barclays cycle hire - there are a few docking points around the park; To simply letting the kids play around Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain. There is pedal boating in Hyde Park - one hour will cost £12 for an adult and £5 for a child. If all this is too strenuous simply take a seat at one of the restaurants for a bite to eat.||August 16, 2013
jenniefornedal||40||This park is sooo big. Especially if you include Kensington Gardens. Let the kids run wild, rest your soul and enjoy life. But keep an eye out for the bikes.||August 15, 2013
tRvlChic7||50||There is a gated playground near Kensington palace, called the Diana Memorial Playground. You buzz for entry and a guard only allows adults in who are accompanied by a child. The playgrounds are amazing. There is sand with water and a huge pirate ship to climb on. Plus there are swings and climbing levels like a regular playground. It was a fun experience for the whole family. The kids loved the playground equipment, especially the pirate boat. It's a short walk to Kensington palace so you can see that too in the same trip.||August 13, 2013
James D||50||A free attraction! After shopping on Oxford street this place allows one the opportunity to take a walk in the grass, stretch out, relax and enjoy on of the worlds great parks.The walk down the east edge also allows you the opportunity to see some of the world's most expensive real estate on Park Lane. Walk from Oxford (Marble Arch) down to Piccadilly then through St. James park to Buckingham Palace, up the Mall to Trafalgar Sq..This is a great place to people watch.||August 12, 2013
Familyon2r||40||Nothing to dislike.It is so nice combining a visit at Nature Historical Museum and within 5 minutes being in the park. The children were tired, so a short boat trip on the Serpentine was perfect (and my son very addicted to taking care of the environment, was very satisfied with the solar driven boat). Coming from the south side of the park, it was possible to see the Albert monument, the princess Diana fountains and the Serpentine within minutes. .... and if you like shopping: After one hour you can leave the park almost opposite Harrods....||August 11, 2013
Graham W||50||We went to Hyde Park to see the Rolling Stones, the venue had been transformed for the British Summertime festival and the weather was glorious. Needless to say the band were awesome, and with the sun shining, the park was magnificent - a trully iconic British band playing at a superb London venue.||August 8, 2013
hazellmarya||50||Hyde Park is a lovely peaceful place. Its great to wander around if you want to get away from the hustle & bustle of London for a little while. In some parts you wouldn't even realise that you were in the middle of a huge city. We always try to make time for a walk through it whenever we visit London. Love it!||August 8, 2013
AshleyW3||50||Hyde Park has to be one of my favourite places in London. It's so big and there is so much to see and explore. I was lucky on my most recent trip to have stunning weather. The park was full of people like me out to enjoy the sunshine. I love all the flowers, especially the rose garden. It is also fun to people watch around the serpentine, see the people in the paddle boats and all the birds. The public bathrooms (at least the one I was in) was kept quite clean and the food vendors aren't too outrageously priced but if you are planning on spending a significant amount of time, it might be wise to take a snack and some water. It really is just a wonderful place to spend the day in.||August 7, 2013
SanderDJ||50||once in a lifetime!! we went there to see the rolling stones, the sun was shining and we had a " day we'll never forget" !||August 7, 2013
Jim B||50||Like something out of a fairy book, the park is full of beautiful trees and wide open spaces. Loved seeing couples picnicking under trees, kids playing, dads giving soccer lessons to little ones and more. We rented bikes and tooled around much of the park. There are some areas in which bikes cannot be ridden, so we did a little biking and a little walking. There’s lots to cover and I really enjoyed the Diana Memorial. The manmade river /playing pond which made a giant circle around a nice big area of grass was filled with little kids splashing their feet and taking a little dip. ||August 7, 2013
Sue W||50||What an amazing park in the centre of London. It's massive walking trail is one that I thoroughly enjoyed.In particular, I loved the pathways not made of cement nor asphalt as we'd normally see. It's a type of stone that I'm not familiar with however for those that like to walk or jog it's not as hard on the feet while running nor does it get as hot as the asphalt normally get in hot weather.Wish I knew what to call it but sadly the stone isn't familiar to me.It is a great place to stroll, walk, run, take the dogs to the park, picnic and just be in a nice tranquil place.Loved, loved, loved staying close to the park and using it as much as I did!||August 5, 2013
musiclovingmom||40||Walked through Hyde Park on our way to visit the statue of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. It was a beautiful walk on a beautiful day. We headed back to Buckingham Palace for the changing of the Guard, but I would have loved to just sit and watch the ducks and swans, or rented a boat to go out on the Serpentine.||August 5, 2013
593dij||50||Instead of using the tube or bus try walking through the park to Marble Arch or accross to the Royal Albert memorial. It is so lovely and even though it was really hot on my visit there was enough shade to make it really pleasant.||August 5, 2013
PolkaDot21||50||Visited this park in July with my boyfriend. Such a stunning park. So much to see. Beautiful water features that make for gorgeous pictures i must add haha! Easy to get to via public transport. Lots of toilets around the park. Lots of ice cream vans and wee shops etc too. Lots to see and do. Defiantly is a great place for everyone. So busy, but still managed to get some space on the grass to chill out and have some alone time to rest and watch the world go by. Defiantly recommend it. The royal parks are fabulous. However, i am disappointed as we never got as far as the princess Diana fountain, but we will go back to that. Enjoy it everyone!||August 4, 2013
cherryames1949||50||What a treat to have our hotel right across the street from the park. We strolled there in the evening, we ate at the outdoor cafe, and of course we visited Kensington Palace. I would definitely want to stay within walking distance on my return.||August 4, 2013
Manicrose||50||Love Hyde park. There is lots to see, beautiful gardens and is well maintained. Best park in London. ||August 3, 2013
Lanval||50||Hyde park is a wonderful location for BST and the Rolling Stones in particular. and anyway it is a great place to be, wander around, watch the people or enjoy the scenery. ||August 2, 2013
HappyTravellers222||50||If your heading for London then whatever you do make sure that you have time to visit Hyde Park.It is a real sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the City and is a wonderful green space.People really use the park and horse riding, cycling, jogging etc are the order of the day, however there is plenty of space to simply walk or have a picnic. The lake known as the Serpentine is lovely and you can hire a boat if you so wish.There is a restaurant at the far end of the lake and public toilets which are free are near to the Lido. The memorial to Diana is also near to the Lido and is a great place for children to play and splash around. You can hire a deck chair at a reasonable cost and just chill out over looking the lake.Parking the car is no real problem on the road side and the cost will not break the bank, it is free to park after 6.30pm.Whenever you visit, you are sure of a great time. We have never been to the Capital without visiting this green paradise. Finally don't forget to wear comfy footwear as Hyde Park is bigger than you think.||July 28, 2013
Daniel B||50||Clean, well-maintained and pleasant. It is just great to walk in the park, see the dogs, squirrels and everyday people going about their business. I would advise hiring a bike and driving through some of the park. Really enjoyable and FREE||July 28, 2013
McNooF||50||It was a wet June day in London and we were determined to see Hyde Park. As soon as we stepped out from the train station the sun came out. We spent at least 3 hours strolling around the beautifully manicured lawns and gardens. I wish we had taken a picnic lunch with us, however there was a very nice cafe in the park to stop for lunch. So pack a lunch and take a camera, and as long as the sun is out you will have a perfect day.||July 28, 2013
S M||50||We could get parking on a busy Sunday afternoon. Parking fee was reasonable and free after 6.30 pm (we did not stay after that anyway)Boating on Serpentine Lake, horse ride, walks, Diana Memorial Fountain, walk across to Kensigton Gardens.....it has to be one of the best places in London||July 26, 2013
LucasBlack||40||Had a great time at the winter wonderland with other half and family.They waited patiently while I tried out all the big rides. Felt like a child. It was awesome.Also explored the park during the day, and while it wasn't the most amazing thing I saw in England, it was pretty cool knowing that bands like the Rolling Stones have played there.||July 26, 2013
Dachemezt||50||If you go to any park while you are in London I would highly suggest you go to Hyde Park. There are tons of things to see besides the rows of trees and grass. You can check out the Princess Diana fountain. You can go to Kensington Palace, check out the flower gardens it contains. Check out the regular flower gardens located within the park. Relax near the Serpentine. Check out the Albert Memorial located by the Royal Albert hall. There is plenty to do here. You can spend a long time walking around the whole park, it is really extensive.||July 25, 2013
beby-chan||50||Visit this park was one of the magical things I'd done in London.I used to wake up early and go have breakfast in this splendid park. It's really beautiful and peaceful so go there if you want a little rest from the city. If you can..another experience is rent one or more bycicle with your friend or your lover and go have a ride inside the park! It's surprisingly enjoyble! ||July 25, 2013
YogeshLad||40||Good park to hangout in summer and if you want to relax under tree, go around water bodies, do some cycling and relax.Good layout with one end next to the Palace and close to many other attractions. Must visit for a family with kids where everyone can play around and can take rest.||July 24, 2013
patelius||40||During my one week visit to London I found Hyde Park a great place to unwind either by foot or by bike. You can pick up a cycle at a docking station and ride around The Serpentine at a leisurely pace. In addition to park benches there are deckchairs available in several areas for the price of £1.50/hour.||July 24, 2013
Maesy359||50||Lovely place to unwind and relax after a day of sightseeing. Easily accessible by the frequent bus services or underground.If you are unfortunate to get lost, then there are lots of people around, who are only too pleased to point you in the right direction.||July 24, 2013
MarcVanderJeught||50||In Winter or Summer the place is always wonderful. I'm always impressed that Londonians can enjoy such a big natural place in such a big city.||July 23, 2013
Stompgal||40||Within my seven years I visited Hyde Park on numerous occasions including three Race For Life events and a couple of Winter Wonderland visits. The park is just the right size for these events and it is easy to get to from Hyde Park Corner station. There are plenty of food kiosks and toilets located throughout the park, although they are easier to find during a Race for Life event. The park also has a stunning lake and some beautiful fountains, including the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain.When I went to my last Race For Life, the stage area was quite a walk from the Hyde Park Corner station entrance but the 5K walk itself was well-signposted and ended near the stage area, meaning that I didn't need to walk too far back for the stage and the stalls. What was also helpful that there was an exit close to the starting point of the walk. As for Winter Wonderland, it has a wide range of stalls and places to eat although a lot of the things sold there are expensive.All in all, this park is definitely worth a visit when Race for Life and Winter Wonderland are on. 4/5.||July 22, 2013
Megan H||20||This park is huge and very little signs. Had a walk around but couldn't even find a exit!! after three hours I was pleased to get away. Some lovely places in the park just in dire need of more signs||July 21, 2013
Tracey F||50||Superbly organised event. Small village inside the enclosure with super variety of food and drink including free water stations (essential on 13 July as it was SO HOT! Thoroughly enjoyed the concert what a super venue!||July 19, 2013
Jillian C||50||If you find yourself with a couple hours to spare, walk through Hyde Park. It is beautiful and peaceful and you feel like you are in the heart of the city. ||July 18, 2013
Carolina N||50||Great place to walk around!!! And it's so cute to see and feed the squirrels (give them peanuts)... It's also possible to see other animals (many birds).||July 17, 2013
dodonthetrains||30||I visited there on Sunday to see Lionel Richie. There was sooo much going on, there was a summer festival to the north end of the park. The centre had been cordoned off for the concerts. There was over 79,000 people there and the staff managed to clear the park around 11 o clock. There was plenty of food vendors not charging too much and the toilets were easily found and no waiting and clean but a bit tight. No trouble either considering just how many people were there in all that heat and drink!||July 16, 2013
KMal777||50||What a huge park with so much to see and do. We caught a Charity Cart around the park and donated a 5 pound gift as the driver was informative & amusing at the same time. Concert was on at Summer Time and listened to Bon Jovi live at a distance one evening. A must see experience in London!||July 16, 2013
MegaDancer||50||My husband and I have seen the Stones several times now, and we reckoned this might be our last chance to see them, so we got the more expensive "hospitality" tickets. Glad we spent the extra cash for those tickets. Really great day from start at 12 noon till finish about 11pm. The hottest day of the year - sun shining - Hyde Park at its best. The hospitality provided all you could eat/drink food, soft drinks, water, wine & beer - champers and spirits were charged for. The food was great, atmosphere great. We took a few forays out into the other areas where there were lots of food kiosks and fun fair attractions. Just the ladies loos were worth the extra cost - clean/enough stalls so no horrendous queues! The seating area had a really good area for wheelchairs etc. There were several good bands playing on smaller stages as well as the main stage. Best of the opening acts was Jake Bugg then the Stones were as awesome as always. 50 & Counting! One of those days you hated to see end!! Well worth it.||July 16, 2013
AirwavesFan||50||One word: Awesome!The gig was obviously fantastic, but strolling through the park was pretty cool as well especially on the hottest day of the year so far. If you want a place to chill out and relax then it's a good green space in London to do it in. I'm sure the genuine tourists would appreciate it.||July 15, 2013
Richard A||40||We met up with local friends, with a 'picnic in the park'. Like hundreds of others we enjoyed a hot Sunday summer afternoon over looking the Serpentine Lake.Although food is available from two restaurants, and a number of smaller venues, we called into a nearby supermarket, buying all the ingredients for a lovely picnic under the shade of an oak tree.A lovely way to catch up with old friends and making new ones.||July 15, 2013
Retyree||50||Seeing the Rolling Stones on 13th July there helped (!) but strolling through the park the next day reminded us what a great green lung for London it is.The Italian Garden; the Serpentine Gallery; the Serpentine itself; the acres of (brown at the moment in the 30C heat!) grass and shady trees; the formal gardens and orangery at Kensington Palace - there's a lot to see.Not many refreshment places, but that's typically London, so take your own.Watch out for the (many) bikes - and rent a "Boris Bike" off the racks for yourself if you fancy getting around a little quicker. They're cheap and convenient. Or rent a colourful deck-chair for 3 hours for £4; £7 all day.||July 14, 2013
dawnd331||50||fantastic open space for walkers and cyclists alike. plenty of room on the paths for both. lovely grassland and plenty of benches to sit and rest. lovely ponds with various wildlife in and on it. great signs around the park so it's pretty hard to get lost. close to local buses and tube station is situated virtually outside the park gates. great place for families to spend a day with a picnic and some outdoor activities i.e tennis or football with the kids. there is nothing to dislike about this park||July 13, 2013
Barcelonabiker||50||We picked a hotel right on the park to be able to run every day. The park is beautiful and well maintained, and it connects to Green Park, then on to St. James Park. What a beautiful oasis in central London!||July 13, 2013
Travellove414||50||Its hard to believe theres such a beautiful peaceful spot in the middle of a city like London but there you are! Definitely come for a stroll or a bike ride, this place is huge!||July 12, 2013
ellen h||50||The park was amazing I had never realised how huge and how many facilities till I walked through the gates.There is something for everyone,jogging lanes,bike lanes,horse riding,boat rides you name it this park had it in buckets.It was an exceptionality hot day and people were sunbathing all over the place.The gardens were packed and everyone was out enjoying themselves.The serpentine boats were doing a roaring trade.The café was over flowing with people jostling for the best outdoor table.What a great day.No were on earth could you get more things to do on a like like that.There was a huge outdoor concert going on it was a bit unfair you could hear it but wasn't allowed to view as the whole area had been blocked in.||July 12, 2013
LN A||40||its the correct place to visit after long day , its a big park and there is a lake you can rent a small boat for half an hour or for one hour , i like it , and there is a speaking corner every Sunday .||July 11, 2013
Freddie198||50||Visited during the British Summer Time arrangement, The Rolling Stones at 6 July. Nice park and arrangement. Visit before 14 July when the arrangement closes. ||July 11, 2013
tombillinge||40||You can easily spend a day exploring all of the parts of Hyde Park. Rich with history, it is full of things to do. The Serpentine is a highlight, as is the Albert Memorial and the Italian Garden.Best to go on a sunny day and just lazily enjoy the park.||July 11, 2013
SedaEg||50||It's one of the landmarks of London and definitely deserves a few trips if you're in the city for a week or more. Nice gardens, nice river, plenty of opportunities to enjoy an afternoon and have a nice picnic. On the weekend when the weather is nice, it is over-crowded but still worth going there. Just walk-around or spend a whole afternoon here. During the week, it's a bit more enjoyable since there are less crowds. If you take the tube to Hyde Park Corner, immediately when you enter the park you find yourself in a remarkable flower garden which is followed by the Serpentine River; all pleasurable to see and take pictures of.||July 11, 2013
Jorge_Bojorquez||50||Its an amazing place to relax, spend family time, visit diferent events happening all year long and make several activities around.||July 10, 2013
Tricia E||50||I spent hours strolling through Hyde Park. I relaxed on the lawn chairs, watched the boats and swans, wandered through rose gardens and had a brilliant day enjoying the people and the scene.||July 9, 2013
SamanthaVlassis||50||Oh, what a lovely place! One of my fave parks in the whole Europe!The animals are so nice and they'll eat from your hand if you're patient enough!!||July 9, 2013
laineybear||40||Had a lovely stroll in Hyde, Park Alber Memorial spectacular. Very asseccible from central London nice open space to enjoy and relax great for a picnic!||July 9, 2013
MartiniGold||40||Great for a family picnic, relaxiig, skating, free events , boating lake. Plenty to do would recommend||July 7, 2013
petesmithhome||50||This a lovely park, make sure you sit in the cafe next to the serpentine and just relax watching the boats!||July 6, 2013
SQ320||50||I am a Londoner and bring visitors here because I know they'll have a good time, it won't bankrupt me and there's a variety of things to do.First off I'd recommend taking the pedalos for a full hour. If I have come by car, I also like going to Bosphorous Kebabs on the Old Brompton Road and picking up a picnic (large mixed grill for about US$10) the best food in London, in my opinion. If the guests I have are classy, there's the Hummgbird shop for cakes a couple of doors down.This area is also excellent if the weather looks nasty and you want to do the museums instead. Head towards the Albert Memorial and the Exhibition Road will bring you to the museums.The Albert Memorial, itself, is an excellent photo opportunity. The Diana memorial as a place for kids to play and there are also areas with swings etc. for kids. For adults there's always the bike hire stands dotted around. The bikes themselves can offer a speedy way of getting to the museums.All in all a nice and varied day out.||July 6, 2013
Jessie K||50||This has got to be the best park i've ever been to, definately a must see. The rose garden is so beautiful, and there is a pond with swans and other birds you can rent row boats or those foot peddle boats. The princess Diana memorial fountain is so nice, definelty one of the best memorials ive seen. Theres a couple of nice places to eat or Plan a couple of hours and have a picnic! There are plently of places to have to yourselves unless theres some type of event like a concert going on, but even then go more towards kensington gardens and you will probably find a spot . . . And be on the lookout for the squirrels! They are very friendly and will come right up to you! You could almost forget you are in a big city its so lovely. ||July 5, 2013
Rafael_Moretti||50||This park is huge, has beautiful lakes and is a perfect place for walking or just sit on the grass and enjoy the view.||July 5, 2013
jaikijaiki||40||Nice green park right in the centre of London. Speakers corner is an attraction. Nice place to hang around. You can get lot of connecting busses /tubes from here to all places of interests around London City.||July 5, 2013
Tor Steinar E||40||yet another of the many green areas in London. You have to give London credit for its many green lunges and in the stress of the day you can hide away and relax||July 4, 2013
bugabiga||50||One of my 7 yr olds favorite things to do on our visit here! We spent a few hours here with him running with my 11 year old chasing all the birds.||July 2, 2013
Jamiechan||50||This, being one of the Royal Parks of London, is so big that I suggest you have at least half the day to stroll around, see the amazing sights and take in the tranquil atmosphere. I started my journey from the Marlborough gate, where the Italian Garden is situated. This garden is beautiful, created to reflect the 'Renaissance Italy'. There are plenty of kiosks selling food and drink, if ever you are hungry. There are also cafes, notably the Lido restaurant and the Serpentine cafe, as they overlook the Serpentine whilst you enjoy your cuppa. Do exercise caution as you walk, especially along the Serpentine, because of the s*** left by dogs and the ducks. If you think you are tired, you can always leave by the nearest gate, as there are plenty of exits around the park. If you have more time, you can also walk over to the Kensington Gardens, which is adjacent to the park. The Orangery at the Kensington Gardens is well-known for its afternoon tea.||July 2, 2013
shropshiretraveller9||50||We spent a couple of lovely sunny hours by the Serpentine in Hyde Park and forgot we were in the centre of London. It was lovely to watch the world go by...........with the exception of the idiotic woman who allowed her dog to go into the water and attack a swan.............but, that aside, we met lots of friendly people of all nationalities and enjoyed an ice cream in the sunshine watching people on foot, on cycles and on horseback. We also noticed how clean it is, we saw people litter picking, emptying bins etc even though it was a Sunday, you wouldn't get that in Shropshire!!I really loved Hyde Park and will spend more time there next time I'm in London, it's huge and I didn't get to see more than a tiny part of it.||July 2, 2013
GH24||40||Hyde park is a bit of a revelation if you don't know the place. The city of London can be quite cramp and stuffy but this is a complete contrast - big open spaces with the impressive Serpentine lake, lots of walks, boats, monuments, Kensington palace, Diana memorial, gallery etc, etc. It took us about 2 hours to cover half the park which included a pleasant stop over at the lido café were we had an enjoyable tea and scone. Unlike some place in London the whole place was clean and friendly. It is also close to the museums so would provide a peaceful break between visits. Well worth a visit if you have the time.||July 1, 2013
Rebecca C||50||Hyde park has a bit of everything!! Places to get an ice cream and a drink, a beautiful boating lake and loads of grass for kids to run and burn off energy. Just got to watch out for the over friendly squirrels.||June 30, 2013
travellingforfun72||40||I have recently visited the park twice, and the previous time was in winter. This is a great place to meet - somewhere is the Serpentine cafe and another is by the Tennis courts because I found it quite disorientating when just in the middle of the park!I am not sure where is changes to Kensington park but it is just lovely||June 30, 2013
Radius360la||50||Hyde Park is huge. There are many things to see and do, from the craziness of speakers corner, to absolute serenity on a quite path, that makes you feel as if you are not in a city, but in a country side. If you are in London it is worth the visit, and a nice break from the hustle and bustle of London. The park is so vast that you can plan to walk from the surrounding upscale neighborhoods across the park and end up close to oxford street and Harrod's department store and lots of other shopping.||June 28, 2013
johny b||50||We enjoy walking here. We come here very often and enjoy pinics walking and takeing photographs of the wild life and trees.||June 28, 2013
Blackadder-York||40||Hyde Park is a great place to take a stroll, have a picnic, play footy with kids, listen to the zealots at Speaker's Corner or simply have a peaceful break and a wander by the Serpentine.A large park in the city with lots of paths and open grass to explore, families and local sports teams flock to the park on a Sunday which all adds to the atmosphere. for those who like a stroll, the southern end at Hyde Park Corner is near to the famous Hard rock Café whilst the Diana memorial is a short walk from the southern entrance to the park and is worth a visit as it's adjacent to the Serpentine. The northern entrance is right next to Marble Arch and the end of Oxford Street so nice to escape the crowds after pounding the pavements of one of the busiest shopping streets in London.Well worth a visit.||June 28, 2013
mcotocdg||50||We saved Hyde Park for our last place to visit before returning home. We walked around the park for a couple of hours and soaked up the nature in the middle of stone and concrete. What a great escape and wind-down from a fast paced vacation. As I have said about St. James's Park, Londoners have found a way to preserve nature in the middle of hectic lives. A marvelous end to a great vacation.||June 28, 2013
Fran1953||50||I am so glad I went to Hyde Park and saw Diana's Memorial. Heard a lot of bad press about it but they are all wrong. Sat outside by the Serpentine and had a coffee, feeding the ducks & geese, it was lovely||June 27, 2013
Laura G||50||Hyde park is a beautiful park, if you want to get out of the busyness of town its a lovely place to go have a walk there are a couple of cafes along the way to site along the water front and just chill I would recommend it||June 24, 2013
MissesN||40||Tranquility in the heart of London. Great place to take the children to run around. Walk the dog or just sit in a deck chair and watch the geese. Two cafe's on the banks of the Serpentine.Currently setting up for concerts in the park. Always terrible exciting (but hope they don't ruin the newly turfed grass)Weekends very busy, especially when the sun is out. Best time of day is early morning.............||June 24, 2013
overpack24||40||On a beautiful afternoon in London I decided to visit Hyde Park. I really enjoyed wandering around, checking out the fountains, statues and the lake in the middle. Make sure you aren't in a rush - I definitely got lost in my wanders but really had fun just relaxing on the benches and reading my book.||June 23, 2013
RivaK||50||A great park to wander through. At Hyde Park Corner you can see Wellington Arch and a statue of Wellington, in the form of Achilles. Nearby are several moving memorials, including ones to the RAF and to forces from Canada, New Zealand and Australia. A little further into the park is a memorial to the victims of the 2005 bombings. Close to that, just outside the park, is the Animal in Service Memorial. Hyde Park eventually becomes Kensington Gardens.||June 21, 2013
Jessa91||50||If you enjoy massive green space for a lovely bimble or a brisk jog- Hyde Park is your place to go! I adore walking beside The Lake and walking across all the way to Speakers Corner to look for some crazies :) Also, The Serpentine has a swim club that you can join to partake in some non-lido orientated swimming!||June 18, 2013
ryanmazure||40||The hyde Park is another one of those places that needs no introduction. Famous as hell with well maintained grounds its great for a stroll or even a romantic rendezvous on one of the benches there. Check it out||June 17, 2013
Sasha R||40||A great (and free!) thing to do while you're in London. I wouldn't recommend it if the weather is bad as it takes at least an hour to walk through it and see some of the statues, fountains and gardens. Filled with beautiful birds, and wonderful views! Definitely a place to take the children & dog! However I would bring your own drink, as a glass of wine in a cafe or beer garden will set you back £10!||June 17, 2013
kmalmberg1||50||I walked early morning cut through Hyde Park from wear end to VA museum. While shopping Cromwell st I took a break and went to the park for lunch on a bench watching horse training. Wonderful and relaxing!||June 16, 2013
emeyg||50||Hyde Park is a must when visiting London. You will enjoyed a stroll through the park and feeding ducks. Don't miss vising the Italian Garden at the end of the Hyde Park and you will be thankful.||June 15, 2013
RachelH350||50||Had a wonderful few hours in Hyde Park. Swam in The Serpentine Lido. A great experience. Sat and read in deck chairs for awhile. Admired the beautiful Rose Gardens. What a fantastic space in the middle of London. Great foodie places within the park too. ||June 14, 2013
GeorgeWorby||40||It's hard to imagine that such a place exists in London, but Hyde Park is a wonderful place to take a break from the main attractions of the city. Hyde Park is well maintained and is bursting with things to see in every corner, from Oxford Street to the Royal Albert Hall. I've been to London many times before, but have never taken the time to walk through the Park and would definitely do it again.||June 13, 2013
anneguide||50||There are a lot people come because fresh air, too much trees. You can do anything such as walking jogging playing..ect||June 13, 2013
Eva T||40||Hyde Park is extremely big! You can walk through different paths, have a picnic, even go cycling! It is a quiet place to chill out and be with your friends, there´s also a lake nearby.||June 10, 2013
GrazGrech||50||We simply loved Hyde Park. They are many activities to do here: hiring a boat, playgrounds for children, beautiful fountains, horse riding, feeding squirrels and the day we visited the park there was also a dog show which was great. Love to visit it again :-)||June 10, 2013
Lisa78570||50||Hyde Park is one of the most lovely places on the face of this earth!And nestled in one of the busiest cities, which makes it even better.Take a stroll anywhere, enjoy the Serpentine and the restaurant at the end, smell the roses in the rose garden, and don't forget a bag of peanuts for the squirrels...they are well trained and will pose for photo ops, as long as you take the picture very quickly!Venture North West, into Kensington Gardens, or Eastward, towards Buckimgham Palace, and equally wonderful Saint James's Park...||June 9, 2013
honestreviewer201||50||We walked to Hyde Park after watching the Trouping of the Colours. Hyde Park is a huge place and event with its thousands of visitors inside, there is still plenty of open space. The lake is great, with lots of swans, geese, ducks and other birds. there are Pedalo's to hire and other boats. It is so nice to see so many people enjoying a communal place, having picnics and just spending family time. The Princess Diana Memorial Fountain is amazing, it was the highlight to our Children's visit to London! It is great to paddle and walk around the fountain.||June 9, 2013
Loveacorona||50||Spent a late afternoon strolling through Hyde Park and Kensington. Flowers, trees all beautifully maintained. Very enjoyable. Sorry Central Park. You need to step it up.||June 9, 2013
travelgirl201077||50||This is a large, beautiful park. We had excellent weather during our visit so we walked the entire park from Hyde Park Corner to Kensington garens. It is really a lovely park. A large lake includes options to rent paddle boats or row boats. We did not do that. Lots of nice benches, snack bars throughout and excellent facilities.The Italian gardens were also lovely. When you need a break from the hustle and bustle of London this is an oasis of tranquility.||June 9, 2013
djsociety||40||Fields of long grass and various sights greet you in Hyde Park. Get away from the bust city for a moment right in the heart of it all! The highlights include the Flower Walk and the Albert Memorial. See the lake and watch the swans dive for food. Don't miss Kensington at the west end. The only possible negative would be overcrowding, but what do you expect in London?||June 9, 2013
emmasholidays||40||Spent a lovely day in the sun today, walked from Kensington Palace to Hyde Park Corner, visiting the Memorial Fountain, and Play area on the way, lovely cafe by the serpentine, and lots of people enjoying rowing boats and pedlos. we didnt manage to see it all, the park is huge!||June 8, 2013
tricx21||40||Was a glorious day and after spending the day running round seeing the main attractions we headed over to Hyde park to do a little bit of sun bathing. Couldn't believe how big the place was. Loved that there were deck chairs available but we preferred to chill out on the grass. We were knackered by the timke we got here to do anything but lie back and enjoy the weather, but i looked liked there was plently to do, including pedalo hire.||June 5, 2013
lancashirelad||50||It's a great open space in the middle of London ideally suited for a long walk or even jogging . You can forget that you are in the middle of London while walking through the park due to its size. It is very central in location and provides a good venue for a day out with family friends or on your own. The lake is not very deep but to suitable for swimming which is prohibited. One can feed the ducks and swans along the lake or have a cup of tea or enjoy a meal at the nearby cafe/ restaurant overlooking the lake. Allow 2-3 hours for a good look around ! It can be a bit lonely in the night hence I would recommend walking around during daylight especially if you are single and female - I guess I am being too cautious as the location in central London and there are probably a hundred CCTV cameras around - clearly common sense judgement required!||June 3, 2013
anand229||40||It was nice and sunny day spent at hyde park. Cycling , boating , horse riding and many more activities can be done there.||June 3, 2013
Steve H||50||We spent an afternoon in the park relaxing before heading off to a show at the Royal Albert Hall. The weather was warm, the Serpentine glistening and sky was blue. London parks at their best! Lots to see here too, from the Albert Memorial to hiring a boat to row on the lake. Beautiful. ||June 2, 2013
merlinslap||50||We walked around The Serpentine, lingered at Speakers Corner, and sat by the Joy of Life fountain. This wonderful park is clean, safe, and a great place to relax and refresh in the center of a great city.||June 2, 2013
BobbyIND||50||Went with kids 13 and 11 and had a great time on a sunny evening. Lots and lots of green space to stroll and laze around. Get down at Hyde Park corner and walked up to Gloucestor Road which is 2 stops by underground. Also went one day early in the morning and was quite cold even in May.||May 30, 2013
TartuCat||50||The largest park of the city and if you feel in mood for a long walk, it would be worth to visit. We took a walk from the Green Park corner and continued walking towards the Kensington Gardens. Near Bayswater Road lie the ornate Italian Gardens with ponds, then we turned right.We enjoyed Italian Gardens and green area which was decorated with numerous statues and urns.There is a statue of Edward Jenner, an English physician, who introduced smallpox vaccinations. The statue was originally erected in Trafalgar Square but was moved here in 1862.Along the Oxford Street we reached Covent Garden where had lunch, finally. No idea how many kilometers did we walk.||May 29, 2013
PATRILEY||40||We went early to hyde park and it was really enjoyable seeing the Diana memorial (unfortunately it was closed for repair) we watched the swimmers and wildlife on the serpentine at a very nice cafe, really peaceful and relaxing and great for people watching.||May 29, 2013
Jacqueline W||50||Love Hyde park for its beautifully kept open space. Coffee and cake at the cafe on the serpentine is a must. A great spot to watch the world go by.||May 28, 2013
Joan M||40||On a sunny Bank Holiday the park was busy, but mostly families, walking, picnicing, cycling. Lots of lovely green space to exersize, walk or just sit on the grass. Even the Serpentine looked good in the sunshine, and the waterbirds were interesting to watch. Only fly in the ointment was the price of ice-cream! Twice what I pay in the Midlands, but there you are!||May 28, 2013
Peter G||40||We took a walk from our home in East London all the way to Hyde Park simply because the weather was so good. There were lots of people milling about and it seemed that the hot-dog and ice-cream vendors were having a great day! We took a look at the prices for a rowing boat on the Serpentine but decided that at £10 each for 30 minutes it was just a bit to expensive! All in all a nice walk and a refreshing quiet day out.||May 28, 2013
Ockham1345||20||Enjoyed Speakers Corner where some people were hotly debating various things. St. James Park was much better.||May 26, 2013
mike e||50||What can I say but that our having a "history"here gives us great pleasure.It is a must see every time we are in London.The Bayswater side is rather nice(Italian Gardens) and walking and sitting and people watching is the deal here.The city park people were refurbing the loo which sucked,as long walks would be needed...oh well.This is londons largest and best park.I can not stress how romantic it can be with the right lady.We will return.||May 25, 2013

Dublinshopper123||50||Even though the sun wasnt out, it was dry and we loved the walk through Hyde Park.Immaculately clean, even the public loos were cleaner than some in cafes.The Princess Diana memorial is surreal, I have always wanted to visit, and found it quite emotional, such a tranquil place which takes you out of the hustle and bustle of the city.Everyone must go!||May 24, 2013
BRIAN R||50||Whilst staying at the wonderful Hilton on Park Lane we visited the Hudson Memorial in Hyde Park and my wife and I being bird watchers we were delighted to be able to photograph Ring-Necked Parakeet Parrots which were released into the wild some 50 years and who have acclimatised to the weather in this country.If however you wish to see and experience wonderful peace we can recommend no better than Middle Temple Lane near the Royal Courts of Justice by the Aldwych, beautiful buildings, lovely tree lined squares, The Temple Church and a wonderful peaceful atmosphere, if you continue to the end of lane you arrive at Embankment of the River Thames.Do go and experience it,well worth the effort||May 22, 2013
eleonoram941||50||If I were a local I would definitely jog each morning here :) All London Parks have such a wonderful atmosphere and this is no different, with a small lake and such a relaxed place to be in the heart of London! It is huge, would love to attend a concert here one time.. Paul McCartney, Coldplay, and tons of other BIG name bands played on summer nights. I have also been twice to Winter Wonderland in December and January, no fee to get in .. a really nice winter magic christmas feeling :) It can be a bit scary to walk alone at night though.||May 21, 2013
keith s||40||I often go for a walk in the park if ever Iam in the area such as knightsbridge or Kensington its a great place in London to relax||May 19, 2013
TravelingHolly||50||I could have stayed here forever. This park makes me want to move to London! It is massive with the most incredible playground for children. I will say that it seemed like EVERYONE in London was there on Sunday, but the park is large enough, you don't feel claustrophobic. There are bikes you can rent to ride through the park. You need a few hours to really take your time and walk through it to see the statues/memorials, etc. Must stop in. It will make any other park look small and non-existent. This park is well maintained and feels very safe. Mostly families are out and about or fitness people running. ||May 16, 2013
Jon1796||30||A beautiful green space in the hectic city - always full of locals on a nice day. If I lived in London, I would certainly be one of them, but as a tourist there's really not that much to see here.||May 14, 2013
adrobe3||50||Most amazing park. Has something for everyone and a fantastic way to waste away a Sunday. Spacious enough that even the biggest summer crowds can be handled with ease.||May 13, 2013
Seb W||50||Hyde park is another place in London worth spending the day for a BBQ or a picnic. Bring some food and relax||May 12, 2013
Balterfam45||40||Was great to walk around but a lot of the area near the Marble Arch was under construction! Get a Mr.Whippy and enjoy!||May 12, 2013
sandyB56||50||It's delightful to spend some time strolling through Hyde Park. Hyde Park is 350 acres and a subsection, Kensington Gardens is 270 acres. At the end of the 17th century, Kensington Gardens became a separate entity when King William and Queen Mary decided to take up residency at Kensington Palace. The Serpentine (a man-made lake) and Long Lake (a narrower lake on the western edge) became the dividing line between the two parks.Kensington Palace and Albert Memorial are located inside this well maintained and clean park. Multiple playgrounds are available for kids.Check a map so that you can plan what you want to see. The vegetation will present itself differently depending on the time of year. At certain places, you can rent bicycles so that you can cover more terrain.||May 11, 2013
Debbie W||50||As you come upon Hyde Park in the centre of London it takes your breath away. Nestled in amongst a concrete mass you suddenly encounter this breathtaking spread of grass, trees and shrubs. You instantly forget that you are in the inner city of London and you find yourself inside a lush "green-lung". The park is beautifully maintained and obviously well frequented and loved by Londoners and visitors to the city alike. You can easily find yourself a patch of grass to park on and be transported into a beautiful English countrside setting in an instant. A great place to re-energise before you embark on your next round of sight-seeing and shopping.||May 9, 2013
kerry s||40||If the sun is out there is little can beat a stroll in Hyde Park and perhaps a cup of tea at the Lido looking over the Serpentine. It is great to see a variety of water birds there (grey heron's included!). The Italian garden was lovely too, and of course, if you have children a paddle in the Princess Diana memorial fountain.||May 8, 2013
buckingham l||50||if you can run or jog, that's how you need to tour Hyde Park. it's quite large and throwing on a pair of sneakers and jogging with a travel companion and a lightweight camera is the best way to do it. It's the perfect park - with a simple twisting road that cuts through it, perfect for cycling or rollerblading or jogging (as if) or just walking and taking in the green grass and leafy trees. Or just sit near the side of the lake and watch the boaters and swans. Or wander over to the Diana Memorial fountain and take int he kiddies running and splashing and having a grand time. Or go over to the Serpentine Gallery and take in some art. Or just find a quiet shady spot for a picnic, followed by a nap."Just it needs some extra mobile toilets :P "There are a couple of Boris bike stands here and there and the park is surrounded by Tube stations, so you can get in and get out easily.||May 8, 2013

Shale J||40||If you need a break from the city and museums go to Hyde Park, it's huge, and they offer fantastic concerts in the summer, when I was there Paul McCartney, Coldplay, and tons of other BIG name bands played on summer nights. Speaker's Corner is fun if you are there on a Sunday afternoon, though it can get a bit strange and offensive, but fun to see all the same. ||May 7, 2013
Thomase77||50||Hyde park is beautiful, there is so much to see and do here. The boating lake is great, although a little expensive. It is a great way to spend some relaxation time in a busy city.||May 7, 2013
Shabtique||50||Huge park, great for any time of the year. Walk or cycle, have a picnic! And in central London, so you can relax in the park and then go shopping in Marble Arch!||May 7, 2013
DogusErdogan||50||the biggest park in London. good place to do sport and have a breath. you can walk near the lake and rent a chair for all day. specially at the weekend many people visit the park but dont worry enough place for every one..if you have a child, you must visit the park.||May 7, 2013
Vgils1||50||Hyde park is one of the nicest parks to while away a few hours. Always busy on a sunny day with lots of characters and great for people watching.||May 7, 2013
dwainlondon||50||The weather was beautiful this weekend which brought out the best in the park. From watching the sailboats gliding across the lake to sun shining on the large glades there was much to see and do while still being in the middle of the best city in the world. The cafe serves everything from coffee to lunches where you can sit besides the lake and enjoy the scenery and people watch all day long.Be careful of the horses riding on the pathways, bikes and joggers on the pavement, but make sure to visit the memorials dotted throughout the park. Not to be missed is speakers corner, some mention the eccentric behaviours of the speakers but this adds to the charm of the park and the diversity of the people of this city.||May 7, 2013
jordanp122||40||I've been Hyde Park many times but my last visit was really good it is not just a big open space of grass If you walk around you will find many different things. You have The Serpentine Bar and kitchen just near the Serpentine lake. They have a lovely Breakfast, dinner and wine menu to choose from not too pricey either.Also I would highly recommend going to the Lido and also seeing the Great Princess Diana memorial fountain.||May 7, 2013
Spikeyd77||40||No better park in London, but really £10 per person on the boating lake!? It's crippling! Lovely park, lovely lake, always something going on whether it's a music concert or just the skaters using the park.||May 7, 2013
Libbylocket||50||We met at Hyde Park corner and walked to serpentine pond walk around and over to Lady Diana fountain.Paddling with the 2 kids is a must -roll up trousers and get in...On a hot day take a cosied.Then we walked to Peter Pan Statue then round to the Parrot enclosure, great photo opportunity.Finished up in the Lady Diana children play park- great that is family only and fenced in.The kids played for hours- next time we will take a picnic.Great free day out in centre of London...||May 6, 2013
johnwb245||40||The park is lovely and not particularly busy at this time of year. We walked the perimeter and spent some time at the Diana, Princess of Wales Fountain. Very tranquil.||May 4, 2013
Barrett S||50||Hyde Park is a must-see. I prefer it during quiet mid-week, take a book and some peanuts to feed to the squirrels. Great energy on a sunny weekend with lots of people and things going on. Beautiful to look at any day ofthe week.||May 1, 2013
DfromNorfolk||50||On a sunny day like yesterday it was lovely. grass cutting on progress giving that fresh smell of freshly cut Spring grass was so nice a contrast to the tube ride heat. arising from the depths of Green Park Tube we strolled along the pathway looking at the well developed broody pigeons, fat on visitor's offerings and full of the joys of an awaiting mate. whilst browsing the central spectical of lazing folk on blue striped deck chairs, it reminded me of an oasis in the sprawl of traffic which was passing by all round, huffing it's exhaust fumes into the bright blue sky, trying to spoil my experience. However, taking in the sights of the green tree tops and the brown tree bows was more desirable and the odd person on the interspersed benches soon became agreeable to my eyes. I dreamt of Taking the arm of a historic Edwardian or Victorian man for a "turn in the park" and reminisced over meeting friends in the sixties, fully aware that it was not the ordinary young girl that sought such an experience.....thank goodness for the sanctuary of the toilets after spending a time watching Rod Stewart and the faces and trying on clothes from our West End Shop.....oh and then out of my thoughts I came brought by the noise of the siren of passing Ambulance....oh I had better get across the road to get to my meeting......this was no day out, just a walk in the park on the way to a business appointment at the Cavalry and Guards Club for my charity trustees. A treat for anyone on a day in London and so lose to historic shops and memorials. speakers Corner one of my old faves ...sad my colleagues had not the eyes and ears and memories of the park.||May 1, 2013
Charlotte B||40||We were very lucky to visit on an absolutely beautiful day in London. Highly recommend renting a bike from Barclays Cycle Hire at one of their locations in the park and riding around. The park is very large and this was a nice way to explore the whole park. Also, renting the bikes can be scary on some of the main streets in London (especially if you are used to driving/biking on the other side of the road!) but it was very easy to do in Hyde Park on flat, clearly marked bike lanes =) So many flowers and people enjoying the park.||April 29, 2013
socoBelfast||40||See Londoners at play and enjoy a bit of relaxation in the heat of the city. Also see the 'other half' nannies with their charges and ladies in chauffeur driven Rolls. Out of my pay range!||April 27, 2013
InesPontes||40||The hyde park it´s incredible huge! In the time I visited the weather was not very nice, so it was not very enjoyable to make a tour. Although, I like it a lot, you can run or ride a bike.. there´s a lake and some atractions (Peter Pan Image is very close).||April 26, 2013
Ninastellanelson||50||Greenery, clean and fresh air. Nice to walk around the park. Prak entrance is beautiful. it is a venue for rock concerts.||April 25, 2013
JoaodeAssis||50||Ideal to be visited in Fall - trees get almost red! -; prepare yourself to sweat inside the tropical green/glasshouse, and to meet your so dreamed enchanted prince/princess wandering (ill-advised) on the so straight, clean sidewalks... It's true!||April 24, 2013
PhaniLouisville_KY||50||Even in the cold it is fabulous. We ate at the restaurant there. It was a magical time. The park is so well cared for, and there are always people walking around. Do yourself a favor and take the time to walk around there. You will here at least 5 languages spoken as you do, stop for hot chocolate and see nature. It's delightful in British fashion.||April 23, 2013
DMilo46||50||This huge park has it all, maybe too much of it on weekends when the park is thronged with locals and tourists. But for biking, jogging, strolling or watching the lunatics in famous Hyde Park corner this can't be beat. Recommended especially on weekdays but anytime well worth a visit.||April 22, 2013
Dave A||50||Great weather, lots of people in the park and a relaxing walk along the banks of the serpentine. A really nice way to spend a few peaceful hours unwinding from the hustle and bustle of London.Bikers, walkers, horse riders, picnickers, boaters, frizzbeers, hockey players, borris bikers, ....... eclectic!Unfortunately the Diana fountain was closed for refurbishment until mid May - the only downside.||April 22, 2013
DeathsDragon95||40||This is a nice place to have a walk around and spend some time, there is some wildlife there to see. There can be quite a few people around here ||April 17, 2013
James D||40||Hyde park is a very nice park. Some of the areas are immaculate.Some are gated off tho. We didn't go for a ride but I imagine it would be nice and relaxing to rent a bike and go for a ride around.We had fun feeding the swans, they come right up to you and eat bread from your hand.Nice way to relax after a day out as London can get a little chaotic.||April 16, 2013
justculturaltourism||50||This huge park offers every kind of activity for people from all walks of life. It is a perfect picnic, cycling, jogging, training place. I have seen people practicing all kinds of sports here. There is a pond somewhere is the middle of a park where it's especially relaxing to enjoy the sunsets.||April 15, 2013
Jenny K||50||I was over there as a tourist, so I can only imagine how relaxing it must be to go there after a busy work day. I was doing a bunch of tours, and had to relax after them. Was lucky enough it was a sunny day, as I found out that in London it rains a lot! I would say... The first place to see on a nice day||April 15, 2013
KryLast13||50||This is just a great place to relax. Hyde Park has something for everybody. We spent almost all day in the city and visiting Hyde Park was so relaxing. You can sit on one of many wooden benches or lay down on the grass. You can watch the people skating, running, picnicking or just walking around. I just love this place. Wish we have something similar in Prague.||April 14, 2013
John A||40||London is a big, busy, bustling, noisy city with people and traffic rushing about in all directions. So what a wonderland gift to be able to go for a walk in the country, to enjoy rolling grasslands, a tranquil lake, magnificent trees, birdsong and the quiet chatter of young lovers walking hand in hand without leaving the centre. Hyde Park, along with the other great royal parks, is an oasis of peace which my wife and I enjoyed tremendously as we strolled to Paddington Station after a visit to the V&A museum.||April 14, 2013
r4yell||40||Huge and beautiful park in the close to the Buckingham Palace. Very good place to simply chill out between visits to museums and other attractions.||April 14, 2013
Julie-anne A||50||This is a great place, for a break between museum visits or shopping, just to chill! The cafe on the river does a great coffee but it is a bit pricey! i think it was £3.70 for a piece of chocolate cake. ||April 12, 2013
neillyb57||40||A pleasant place to walk relax and watch London go by. See calvary ride by, feed the ducks, stop for a drink or meal. A large green space where there are many pleasant walks.||April 10, 2013
safenoe||40||So much to see in Hyde Park, even on a cloudy day! The Italian gardens are very ornate. There'a also the Peter Pan statue. Also is Buckhill Lodge which is located on the edge of Hyde Park. Believe it or not, it's a rental property and if you have a few thousand pounds to spare for weekly rent, it's available next year for rental. Be careful of unleashed dogs and cyclists from behind (ding! ding!! ding!!!) and you'll be fine.||April 10, 2013
Susan P||50||The title says it all, such beauty right in the middle of red buses and black cabs, children were able to run around safely after walking around holding hands, was able to get to lots of different places by walking through Hyde Park! Saw lots of sites too , can't wait to visit again in the summer so we can sit and have a picnic.||April 9, 2013
PrettyTravels||40||You cannot visit London and not stop by Hyde Park, especially if you are on your first trip…I've read too many novels and seen too many movies with Hyde Park as a backdrop to not go. Haha. I was lucky enough to go during their Christmas market time so I didnt see much of the park itself but I saw the charm of christmas themed stalls..hot cider/wine, food goodies and carnival games. There was even a skating rink in the middle of everything. I went here with my relatives and it was fun taking in the atmosphere and people watch. I found it really charming during the winter, but I am sure in the summer there will be duck feedings, poetry readings and picnic possibilities. ;)||April 8, 2013
EasyJourney||50||Great place to spend a few moments, or hours, chilling out. Just what you need to get away from a busy day. Attractions include Speakers Corner, Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, Kensington Palace. The Orangery near Kensington Palace is a treat for real English afternoon tea. Bounded to the North East by Marble Arch (used to be the entrance to Buckingham Palace until they moved it because it was too small to get the coaches through), Edgware Road and Oxford Street. On the East side is Park Lane with all the posh hotels and car salesrooms. Also an underground car park if you need one, although it's best to do without the car in London. South East corner is Hyde Park Corner, with Piccadilly running off to the east up past the original Hard Rock Cafe, Green Park (10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace), the Ritz and on to Piccadilly Circus. To the South, Knightsbridge, Brompton Road and Harrods. To the West, Kensington Curch Street with lots of interesting shops. To the North West, Bayswater, Queensway with more shops and restaurants. And right in the middle, the Serpentine (lake) used in the 2012 Olympics. Just enjoy the space. And of course every so often there is a huge concert............||April 8, 2013
filmex||50||Hyde Park is the Queens back yard...It is a wonderful park and after shopping out in Oxford Street it is a grear place to walk and relax.On Sunday at 'Speakers Corner ' people can gather to express their views ,however extreme...It is 'Freedome of Speech' gone to the extreme...but it is mostly light hearted but there are many eccentrics and expressions of raciscm , homophobia, Fascists, Communists, Jihadists....Gosh !!! You name any extreme group and they could be there being heckled but it can be fun ....The police are always there to keep a semblance of order in case over heated turns into something more...I would not recommend taking children...The language can be very rich...to the point of obscene....but a 30 minute visit will convince you that there is freedom of speech....||April 7, 2013
KimTRanda||50||One of our most memorial afternoons in London last year was spent biking in Hyde Park using the Barclays Rental bikes - Kensington Palace, Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, Italian Gardens. As soon as you get to London, you will see them everywhere.Tips: Set up bike account prior to leaving the US since their machines having difficulty accepting US credit cards.||April 6, 2013
Natalie T||50||Could spend a whole day in there and not see it all. It is a big park. Many tourist attractions can be accessed via the park. Buckingham palace, Kensington palace to name a few. There is an Italian garden and a little café called Lido not far from the Italian garden that was lovely for a cup of tea. Diana's memorial gardens are also in the park, not far from the café. ||April 5, 2013
Avmr F||50||Walking thru the park is one of the most attractive activity one can have wilst staying in London, and especially during Spring time||April 4, 2013
Courters613||50||Loved Hyde Park. So easy to get to on the Underground and so relaxing once you're there. I was lucky enough to arrive in London on a beautifully sunny day, so it was lovely to sit on the grass near the lake in the park and just soak up the sun after sitting on an airplane for 10 hours.The rose gardens are beautiful and such a joy to just sit and people watch in. I went back to the ark multiple times during my stay in London, just to recharge my batteries between activities.||April 1, 2013
StephanieEFx||50||Absolutely beautiful, I loved walking through it in the morning and on the night time. Felt very safe.||March 20, 2013
ian_dempster||50||Stayed opposite at Thistle Kensington Gardens. Went for walk about 7am on a Sunday morning, it was bliss so very peaceful after the hustle of Saturday round the west end. Park very quiet at that time , a few joggers and dog walkers but very few. Never really been in the park before, saw the italian gardens, very pretty with the biggest swan I have ever seen,walked then by some statue by the Serpentine, so very calm and still, lots of bird wildlife. Walked then to Prince Albert memorial and then towards Kensington Palace. Spent about 50 minutes walking in the park before breakfast and really enjoyed the fresh air and the calm before going back to the hustle and bustle.||March 19, 2013
luisa d||50||I loved the squirrels...they were all over the place, eating from your hand, running, so sweet...It was so relaxing to take a walk thorough this park. just lovely.||March 19, 2013
Kelli W||50||Although cold and wet, this magnificent free-entry annual event in Hyde Park is definitely worth a visit. With many major theme park attractions and side show alleys combined with European christmas market crafts, German bier tents, and a sneaky mulled wine and chocolate covered pretzel, there is certainly something for every member of the family. An all day event that needs to be well thought out and planned, particularly if you are coming from the outter areas of London as it is a major attraction and public transport can get very busy. I would recommend wearing gumboots (wellingtons or galoshes) or comfortable waterproof boots and taking an umbrella or plastic poncho as a back up. Have a generous spending limit as each and every ride, tent or vendor costs a tidy sum, Great day had by all.||March 18, 2013
Hoojar||40||Took a walk round the park on Sunday Morning and had a coffee.Its bustling with walkers, joggers, cyclists, horse riders and tourists yet at the same time relaxing and invigorating.Well worth a visit if you are in London and have an hour to spare.||March 17, 2013
durhamd||40||Just 10 minutes walk from Oxford St but a different world away for the noise and crowds. Pleasant to walk alongside the Serpentine observing the waterfowl and watching the grey squirrels.If you are feeling energetic you can always hire a pedallo.Nice way to get to Knightsbridge and Harrods.||March 16, 2013
Jacqui S||50||Often the hustle and bustle of a city can be overwhelming especially when you first arrive. A walk through Hyde Park and the adjacent Kensington Park is guaranteed to help you adjust. These beautiful parks are a wonderful mixture of historical sights, lovely scenery, squirrels, and good eateries, not to mention the access it gives to so much of London around its borders. Well worth the visit. If you go once you will most likely visit these parks regularly as a result, we did!||March 11, 2013
maria_1550||50||we liked to finally visit this famous park in person and were not disappointed. pity we could not visit on a sunday or attend some event as we were there in february||March 5, 2013

southeastsam||50||Spent a Sunday morning in January walking around Hyde Park and it was wonderful. Speakers Corner is a must. It was fairly quiet with just Sunday morning dog walkers and runners. Lots of space and the rose gardens are beautiful. Make sure you stop and see the ducks. If you are staying in London and Sunday morning walk around Hyde Park is a must!||February 27, 2013
Igor295382||50||Excellent experience, I could feel the life of England Kings and King families. Kensington Palace Museum, the Lake and everything in Hyde Park is incredibly.||February 25, 2013
Frenchylovefood||30||This park is perfect to relax... in winter just have a walk around the Serpentine, feed birds and squirrels. In summer stop one hour for pedalling on the Serpentine,enjoy the sun and then have a picnic.||February 25, 2013

Josy A||50||With corner speakers of all religions, explaining the good of their faith. Beautiful walk on Sunday morning, and since we were so close to Marble Arch, after visiting the park, we went for some last minute shopping before going to the airport. ||February 23, 2013
LondonLad121||50||What a wonderful place to visit on a bracing February winters afternoon. Entering by foot from Alexander Gate, it is only a short stroll before you are able to take in a view of the stunning Albert Memorial - you can only imagine the love our late Queen Victoria felt for her husband Albert when you see the golden statue of him looking out onto the park and the Royal Albert Hall just across the road. From there you can walk to the Princess Diana Memorial Garden which must be fun for kids, old and young alike in the summer months when they can walk in the cascading water. Then it's onto see the Serpentine lake where you can watch the ducks, swans and moor hens going about their day. If you dress up warm to keep out the wind and winter weather, taking a walk in this beautiful Royal park is well worth the effort and if you take a few peanuts (unsalted) in your pocket you are sure to get a chance to feed the squirrels who were amazingly bold in approaching people walking along quiet pathways. If you get a bit chilly you can always break into a jog to get the circulation going and pop into a park cafe for a nice hot drink.Enjoy!||February 23, 2013
7_Fitz7_7_7||50||A fabulous piece of serenity in the middle of the city. The perimeter is a refreshing walk and there are always dozens of runners and cyclists around!||February 22, 2013

johanna_borg||40||Hyde park is a lovely green space with many events and activities throughout the year, there's always something to see and do. In the summer time you can paddle a boat on the lake, ride a horse, do some people-watching, go for a stroll or sit on the grass and have a picnic. During my last trip to London I visited Winter Wonderland and it was absolutely magical! What a great atmosphere. No fee to get in either, though the rides, food and beverages were a bit pricey.||February 19, 2013
MyLittleVoyage||50||This place in Winter, during the months of November, December & January, when set up for Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, is magical!Stalls, shops, restaurants, rides and shows, what more could you ask for to get you in the festive mood?Well worth a visit.Also, outside of the festive season, it's a lovely place to walk. Just watch out for the cyclists!||February 18, 2013

karolina p||50||If you had enoughof the city buzz on your trip and need a time out,this is the place to go.Lovely quiet,green,lots of birds and squirrels which are getting so brave towardspeople,one took a piece of biscuit from my hand!You can hear doves cooing,if you follow the river,theres plenty benches to sit on and feed the ducks,geese,all sorts of birds,i saw pelicans at one point!If you follow signs you can get to a Peter Pan Memorial which they used in the movie 'Hook'.||February 15, 2013
magmug88||40||Nice place to walk and get away from the noisy streets! Easy to get to and good for jogging, walking, and bike path.||February 15, 2013
MariOn14573||40||The Observation wheel is only in Hyde Park for a few weeks every year from the third week of November till the New Year when it gets dismantled with the rest of the fair side shows and attractions for another year......In Hyde Park on a Sunday morning you can go to listen to people speaking about different views on various topics which is interesting - even if you do not always agree.....There is also Peter Pan playground in Kensington Gardens where children can play for free and there is a wooden ship to climb on .... The playground is nearest ot Bayswater underground station in Queensway......There is also the Serpentine river where you can go boating and in the summer even swimming.....There is the Princess Diana memorial also near the boating lake that is definitely worth going to - as well as Kensington Palace and the Orangery Cafe for a cup of coffee and a cake after visiting Kensington gardens where Princess Diana used to live and Princess Margaret. There is also the Serpentine Gallery that is definitely always worth seeing and most exhibitions are free.....The prince Albert memorial has been cleaned up and is also an attraction worth seeing when walking through Hyde Park towards the Royal Albert Hall..On weekends it is also possible to hire horses and ride on special tracks around Hyde park with the people from the stables with you....That is a different way to view Hyde Park........||February 14, 2013
Paiger3||50||The park is beautiful, it's a must see. There are statues, ponds, Princess Diana Memorial & other points of interests to discover. We loved the beauty of the park, especially, seeing people enjoying what the park has to offer them in a busy bustling city.||February 14, 2013
JenQatar||40||Hyde park is large,open and historical. It makes one feel the traffic is far away. Many interestkng statues and birds ans squirrels- feed the birds-it,s an experience as they descend on one in a cloud!||February 12, 2013
Jon M||30||In the Winter, Hyde Park offers a 'Winter Wonderland' experience. A free-to-enter attraction that offers traditional German-style Christmas markets, bars and pubs selling mulled wine and other winter-warmers and and a fairground working on a token system. One token is £1 with rides being around 3- 5 tokens per ride. I loved the German markets and got a very Christmassy sensation around this part however found the fairground to be tacky and overpriced. We went on a Friday afternoon and left at around 6pm before the large number of crowds entered. At peak times they restrict entry based on crowd levels so choose your time wisely.We visited the Ice Cave set up in the park, with an Ice Maze and sculptures enclosed in a temperature-controlled building. Very cold but very interesting and that was worth the price of ticket.||February 10, 2013

It was an attraction one could never miss to see on visiting London.We have some beautifull photos there.One could forget all his troubles by beeing there.Go see for yourselves||February 10, 2013
Rose P||30||Good place to sit and have a picnic, or go for a cycle. Nice walk from end to end, and you can then walk down oxford street. ||February 9, 2013
robin j||40||Hyde Park is a delight for people who enjoy seeing dogs and children having fun. The Italian Gardens are wonderful, now that they have been refurbished. ||February 8, 2013
PeterR432||50||A fantastic resource for Londoners and visitors alike. Well worth a walk int the park. There is plenty of wildlife to observe and a huge area of open parkland to appreciate. What is particularly interesting is that you can imagine you are a long way from being in the centre of a busy city, it is so quiet and restful. Plenty of water birds also and an amazing variety of them.||February 5, 2013
PrestonGuild||40||A royal park that is one of the largest in central London, its also divided by the serpentine. Its a hefty walk and in the summer there are always some kind of events. As it was winter we only explored a small part of the park, admiring the serpentine and having a bit of a run-around with my son before headed to explore some of the museums.||February 4, 2013
oldaccringtonian||50||Have a walk away from the hustle, but take comfy shoes to London, you end up walking miles!!!It's all manageable though||February 2, 2013
Eventhzevoice||40||Buy some food and drinks in one of the supermarkets nearby, and enjoy the park when it´s sunny. Sit on the grass, watch people go by, and rest a while.||February 2, 2013
Michael213||40||Depending on where you are you can have bustle or tranquility. Can easily spend a day strolling around - take a picnic - doing nothing or something. A boat on the lake is a tradition I've yet to do. You canjust keep returning and find something new||February 1, 2013
HappytimesRhuddlan||40||Thought this was great.People moaning about prices wake up your in London best City on the world.fair ground rides ok ,stalls very popular and Beer festival tops. good night out, thats what it is all about.

Gipsyqueen90||50||If you're going to London in december, you can't miss Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park! A Christmas atmosphere with every kind of fun, food and music... even if it's cold, you won't feel it! ;)||January 31, 2013
Kingfisher05||50||Hyde Park is a must to see. In winter you can visit the Winter Wonderland.In summer you can have a picnic. It is huge and have something for everyone. ||January 31, 2013
Ereva J||40||Hyde Park set inbetween all the hustle and bustle is a good place to relax but be wary of pick pockets too many of them going on now.||January 30, 2013
Nathan B||50||A good place to come when you need to relax. I like the view from the duck pond. Great on a nice and sunny day.||January 29, 2013
antique9410||20||Of course we all have heard of Hyde Park and the Speakers Corner...so it is usually on the travelers' list of "things to do". My husband and I were no exception and on this particular sunny day we decided to walk in the Park and snap a few photos. The park was very beautiful but we were a little intimidated by so many "black flowing robes". Taking pictures was a problem because of the excess of ladies in black everywhere. I was verbally attacked a number of times because I was pointing a camera at them - even though I was really trying to get a photo of the park. On the Speaker's Corner. Police presence was a little scary. Very outspoken muslimmen for the most part whose voices were very angry.. We were not comfortable standing in any of the groups listening and shouting to the speakers.Perhaps other visitors would be comfortable in this situation, and if so, please visit the Park as it is an experience.||January 25, 2013
lowsonfordllama||40||Fabulous to see Hyde park under a few inches of snow. Everyone looked really happy in spite of the cold.||January 24, 2013
Steven W||50||This is where I go when I need some fresh air during a long layover. Instead of staying at the airport I come into the city and just walk. The exercise - or at least stretching the legs - is good. Don't miss the statue of Peter Pan!||January 24, 2013
Penny F||50||what a fantastic time of the year to visit Hyde Park. Winter Wonderland is a fantastic day and/or night out. Every year around xmas time Hyde Park comes alive to the sound of xmas carols, laughter and singing. there are stalls and Mulled wine, ice skating and such a wondrful atmosphere. I travelled from Australia and it was one of the highlghts of my trip||January 23, 2013
Mandy B||30||Hyde Park Winter Wonderland was OK... it was hardly a "Wonderland" experience to be honest and didnt really resemble the photos I had looked at on their site. It basically is a Christmas fair as you get in most cities. The Ice Kingdom was impressive - but very small and only took about 30-minutes to get around it in full. Rides and food all very expensive - watch out for cheeky squirrels too!||January 23, 2013
liezel l||50||My hubby and I recently visited London, after visting Harrods we decided to go and enjoy our lunch in Hyde Park, we opted for the paid deck chair option....well worth it! A beautiful setting, minutes away from the hustle and bustle of the City!||January 20, 2013
designdane||40||Worth a visit, beautiful display of lights, rides for the children, food stalls, mulled cider, all things christmas, very festive for the holidays! A nice walk in the evening, a must see!||January 18, 2013
Cardinals11312||50||Since most landmarks and museums were closed by the time we were done with high tea and relaxing, we decided to go over to hyde park after seeing posters of their winter wonderland. WOW! It was so much fun! I think it runs from the end of November thru the first week of January. There was beer, wine, and liquor every couple stops! So we were able to walk around and enjoy our adult beverages. They had little shops all throughout. The rides looked so much fun and there were so many! There was an ice skating rink but it was too long of a wait for us to do that. They had an ice sculpture display that you were able to walk through that was so cool. They had a "beer carousel." It was just a great way to spend the night. I left my camera at the hotel that night and I really wish I didn't because there was plenty to take pictures of. If you are in London while this is going on, definately go and plan to be there at least 3 hours! ||January 18, 2013
yfw1||40||Fantastic place to go for a couple or family to either picnic or just explore. You are close to different points of interest also if you fancy a change. The lake in the park i feel is very pretty, peaceful and tranquil. ||January 16, 2013
MatthewGil||40||Really big park with plenty of dogwalkers and joggers. It's a great escape from the noise and numbers of people in the rest of the city, but still very central.||January 14, 2013
Paul D||50||What an excellent day out, you think you've been transported to the Alps for the day, lots to see, do and eat.||January 14, 2013
Eu J||40||Its has been a chilling day rooming the streets of london via underground tubes. Heres we are spending a day a Hyde Park during the winter .We have lots of time to waste here. coffee by the lake , strolling with the company of ugly ducklings and enjoy the atmosphere at the winter wonderland. This is what i call a holiday , you donlt have a schedule ,. good for me to unwind and relax here, it has to be winter , it would'nt be the same if its not .||January 13, 2013
Carley S||40||whether you visit in the the spring for a walk through to Kensington Gardens or in Dec for winter wonderlan it's always special.Walking through the park from speakers corner to hyde park corner or over to Kensington Palace well worth the trip to experiance some of the royal parks London has to offer.Winter wonderland is quite expensive the rides for adults are about £4-5 per person so choose wisely, there are various food stalls all around to choose a snack from. Though it does get very busy at times||January 13, 2013
daisy21980||10||WE pre purchased tickets to the winterwonderland iceskating for the 20th December. We however did not use our tickets because the rink was more like a lake. I have videos and the water is so deep there are waves from the skaters. A complete waste of money and over priced, next year we are going back to somerset house.||January 11, 2013
Leeze57||40||Visited a couple of years ago with friends and had a great time. Went again this year with my partner and it was just as good. Even more stuff to do - gets bigger every year.Rides very pricey though - would be very expensive for a family day out.All the lights are great in the eveningLoads of different food and drink outlets - mulled wine (not very warm though) and bratwursts as well as burgers etc.||January 10, 2013
Slipstream222||40||One of the biggest winter fairs I have seen a lot of high quality ride and stalls - the organisers seem to have set the bar high and all the rides have a winter theme, not just another waltzer in a park - the bumper boats in the seperate kids area were all penguins, the haunted house had an ice make over - not cheap but a lovely christmas feel good day out. Take the tube to Hyde Park Corner it's right there.||January 10, 2013
niamhd90||50||Rent bicycles and cycle Hyde Park. It was a very relaxing cycle and loads to see. Cycle path throughout which was very useful. ||January 7, 2013
lisa o||50||This is a great place to bring the kids to let them run wild and blow off some steam especially as this was our first time in london and all the crowds and tube journeys and busy attractions have u on overdrive mode this is a nice place to unwind i loved seeing families on horseback so close to the city , bring a picnic.||January 7, 2013
CoffeeSeekingKing||40||During winter: Winter Wonder Land is on. It's a big fun fair which expands every year more and more. Have to say, it's a bit pricey but the fun you'll get, is really nice. If possible, go visit it during the evening because the lights from all the stands are very nice. Every year it expands to an higher level with more atractions and stalls!During summer it's great to picknick with stuff you buy in Selfridges, Marks & Spencer or Tesco ... they are all located close to the park! You can find a lot of squirrels who can join you during the meal :-)don't hesitate, if you look for a quiet place in a crazy city ... this is the place to be !||January 7, 2013
PheonixWelshGirl||50||Hyde park is a great place to go for long walks come rain or shine, also a great place for meeting friends for picnics in the summer, it is such a vast area you will find space so you are not cramped with others....In the winter (end Nov-Beginning Jan) they hold the Winter Wonderland...Somewhere you should all go, so many stalls to see, rides to go on, bars, circus, the list is endless a great day/evening out.||January 6, 2013
active92||50||Brilliant place to relax and have a walk. Clean and it is close to Buckmingham Palace. There are a few waffle stalls nearby. A great place to go there during the morning and have some fresh air.||January 6, 2013
wanderinggeordie||40||Both of us attended the Winter wonderland here at Hyde park on New years day.If you have kids it's great for the rides.Plenty of food stalls and Xmas stuff .Its like going to Bavaria.Bratwursts ,mulled wine and other interesting artefacts on show.Better to come at night as the stalls and rides lights are on.Rides are paid for at booths and you are given tokens to use on different ridesDefinately worth a visit.From November to first week in January.||January 6, 2013
SinWithAGrin86||30||Not much to see or do in Hyde Park, except when Winter Wonderland is on, which is what was on when I visited in November.||January 6, 2013
snowgirl96||40||Beautiful big park! The park was too big so we just directly went to the lake. So many different and cute animals everywhere! spotted a squirrel on the way to the lake too! so cute! Very nice to just sit on the benches and enjoy everything around you.||January 5, 2013
DeeF401||50||This is a beautiful, historic park in the centre of London and the most romantic place for a picnic. There are a couple of places to go inside for coffee if its cold and at one end you can visit the Diana Memorial fountain||January 5, 2013
Sophie B||30||Visiting London at Xmas, I had been told Hyde parks winter wonderland was a must visit. In the past I have visited Hyde park in the summer. However, upon arriving there was terrible rain which literally put a 'damper' on the day. Just your average overpriced german market and fairground rides, nothing significantly wintry or significant o London just an average fairground. However is not bad for free entry with a great diverse atmosphere of families, friend, co-workers and couples. Great for time with loved ones in the holidays.||January 4, 2013
Kim C||30||Food for a family of four was very expensive at this venue, so we left to eat dinner. The venue was lovely and lots going on but expensive if you wanted to do things rather than look. We did four things which cost over £100 and lunch for four of pie and drink £26. All fairground rides payable and some of them £6 per person, could easily spend a fortune on a full day out here.||January 4, 2013
bec b||40||This is a beautiful park to walk through and or ride through on a Barclays bike! It's a huge park, great for picnics and events! ||January 4, 2013
UOtterTravel||30||I found this when researching our New Year's Eve weekend in London and thought it would be fun. The thought of going through a German-style Christmas market sounded exciting (we love the markets in Munich), and I wanted to go through the Magical Ice Kingdom. I booked the Ice Kingdom tickets in advance so that we wouldn't have to worry about getting tickets upon arrival. I received our e-tickets fairly soon after payment. You do not have to pay to get into the "wonderland". If the grounds are too crowded, they limit people going in, but if you have tickets for a timed event you can get into a different line so that you don't miss your ticket time.We arrived around 4pm on Sunday and it was packed! It was difficult to get through the grounds because people would stop wherever they were to watch some of the rides. We arrived at the Ice Kingdom and told to queue up. We went in before the time on our tickets and it wasn't too bad of a line once inside. Folks were stopping to take pictures and if you were ready to continue you could just pass them. There was an ice slide and there were only a few people in front of us to go down. We enjoyed the Ice Kingdom.The rest of the "wonderland" wasn't that appealing to us. It was mostly carnival rides and midway games. The Christmas market sold mostly mass produced items, and not handicrafts like we've seen in traditional German Christmas markets. There were quite a few food stalls, mostly on the pricey side. We split one sausage, and opted to have dinner once we got back to our hotel. There was also a German beer hall. We didn't go on any of the rides as we weren't really interested, and as others have stated, the prices were high. It was interesting to see, but if we're in London again over Christmas/New Year's we will skip going again||January 3, 2013
felixandmaddie||10||We visited as a Christmassy treat for our 3 children and mother-in-law. From a distance the attractions looked great, but on arrival we realised the Winter Wonderland is actually just a fairground. And a super expensive fairground. Minimum ride price £4 for a pre-schoolers merry-go-round...the sort of thing you'd normally feel a bit ripped-off paying £1.50 for. Anyway, we had booked for the Ice Sculptures so had to go in....this is where the endless queuing started...lots of waiting around. Not much fun, and definitely not 'magical'!!The Ice Sculptures were pretty good..however inside more queuing for the ice slide, and then waiting for people to have their picture taken by the official photographer (why anyone would pay £8 for a souvenir photo was beyond me) made it all tedious. Such a shame as it could have been a lovely experience.All in all too commercial - felt like a one-stop rip-off. Oh yes, paying £6 for 3 sweet laces from the sweet stall was a final reminder of why we wouldn't recommend this attraction to any sane, normal family!!!||January 2, 2013
likest0travel||50||Have been several times and this year was definitely the best1. It isn't freezing in London at present :)2. Motorbike stunts in Zippos circus were outstanding3. the hounddog rockabilly band, there for the first time I believe this year were incredible and well worth watching a whole setIt is very pricey (£6 for some of the rides) but the rides really are some of the best thrill rides in the UK, Food is expensive but there are lots of snack options.Magical!||January 2, 2013
491MartinH491||40||Went to Winter Wonderland on the 27th and it was a great evening good german markets and beers and a lot of fair games and rides which can be a little expensive if you get carried away. Would recommend and get involved in the ice skating||January 2, 2013
mfozzey||20||our first trip to winter wonderland was a few years ago and we loved it , so this year we was realy looking forward to it we booked the ice world tickets in advance , then the day arrived we got there early and all looked good about 1400 hrs was not to packed so started to walk down main part and was soon greated by the food and drink stalls more to the point the prices of them i expected them to be a bit steap but they was just to much , as we walked around all it seamed to be was a giant big funfair with rip off food / drink stalls and tacky stalls selling tacky goods . this is deff the last year we go , next year its going to be a wander around londons side streets looking at all the littel shops , and popping in a back street pub or two not walking round a huge funfair were you get the feeling all you are is a money maker so very very dissapointed||January 2, 2013
Swainy38||10||We visited on the 30th December mainly for a birthday treat but also because we thought it wouldn't be as busy as before Christmas - boy were we wrong !! Everyone had to walk around the park in one direction because it was that packed with people. Couldn't see what was being displayed on the stalls in the Christmas Market. Had to pay £4.00 for a hot dog but instead of having real onions all they had were dried crispy onions ????. We didn't take any children ourselves, however my sisters took their daughters, and were charged £4 for the children to go on the fairground rides and adults were charged £6 for rides. We booked in advance to go on the Observation Wheel so we wouldn't have to queue when we got there, but after 20 minutes of queueing (and with aching feet !!) we finally were able to board the wheel. Am now able to tell people that I have finally visited the Winter Wonderland but can also say that I definately won't be visiting again, a very disappointing birthday treat and to be honest a big disappointment all round.||January 2, 2013
WhiteWolfDK||50||During our stay in London we visited this attraction and was very pleasently surprised, a lot of amusement parks could learn a lot from this, all ages could enjoy the day as there was different rides for everyone.We also visited the Magical Ice Palace (additional cost) but it was worth the money (8£) the ice sculptures was so beutiful, incredible they where made only of ice. Entry to the Winter Wonderland is free but there are Circus and other places that will charge you for entry.If you're around London during christmas, don't cheat yourself from a visit here.||January 2, 2013
JoanneM74||40||First time that we have been to this attraction and it was well worth it.Free to get in although you pay extra for ice skating and rides.Lovely stalls selling everything from arts and crafts to mulled wine and lovely foods.Enchanting to walk around at night and see everything all lit up.My ten year old loved it and we will certainly be back next year.||January 2, 2013
jones_212||50||a lovely continental feeling to Christmas. would recommend it to everyone to get into the Christmas spirit. Lots of unusual gifts and food to try and taste.||January 2, 2013
jackie c||20||Looks beautiful but the minute we entered we couldn't wait to get out! We visited the last weekend before christmas at about 5ish. Never again and really glad we hadn't pre-booked any of the special attractions. It was absolutely heaving with people and being short with two kids we couldn't see a thing!! There are much nicer places to ice skate ie Somerset House and Westfields shopping centre and you can go on fair rides anywhere. The couple of fair like stalls we went on were between £3 and £5 a time and the queues for other rides were very long. I do not like overly commercial attractions andIi know others who have thoroughly enjoyed this place but I just think there are much better places to go in London at Christmas time. The Eye had no queues and the stalls along the embankment were just as pretty but you could actually get to them!! Best part you don't have to pay to get in but hey just rip you off once you are.||January 2, 2013
22Atomic||40||brilliantly set up and looks fantastic at night when its all lit up.the german markets and stalls are great and the quality of food and drink is great (albeit pricey)the queues for the rides were long but they were short for food etc.local tube stations are very busy though, a great day out and we will go again next year.||January 1, 2013
R-BIRMINGHAM||50||Decided to come here on new years eve 2012 we arrived about 6pm parked up no problem and did'nt have to pay to park. We made our way to the park which was quite a little walk we got on park fine surprised as i was expecting to be stood in queues. The rides were fast to get on and theres some good quality rides. Theres tons of huts to buy nic nacs from and lots of eaterys. We went into the carousel bar which was fab not good idea when your really drunk though as you could end up throwing up fab atmosphere. We then went into the Bavarian bar that was also fantastic atmosphere and the drink were'nt over priced either which we was expecting so even better. We stayed on park till it closed then went to watch the fireworks over the thames which was great. Best new year we have had in a long time will be doing it again. Plenty of cash machines and toilets. Cant wait to go next year. The rides are a little pricey and take cash for rides as they dont accept cards.||January 1, 2013
Donna U||30||Visited at night shortly before it closed. We didn't have much time so just wandered through from one end to the other for a look. Walked down from Marble Arch entrance - in the pitch black. Huge fairground. Fun atmosphere but extremely crowded. Lots to see and do. Expensive. Wouldn't rush back to be honest.Would like to have a better look at the park itself sometime.||January 1, 2013
elli s||30||Definately got us into the Christmas spirit but was expensive, eg cup of tea £2, but tasted like dishwater! No credit cards/card payments allowed except for tokens for rides, so had to use cash for eateries/drinks and stalls. Definately recommend booking a couple of attractions to distract kids from wanting to go on everything. We went to the ice sculpture exhibition and the circus. both were great and the kids loved them. Well worth the money.||December 30, 2012
misukkeli||50||Beautiful, huge park! There was Winter Wonderland on when I visited, which was absolutely amazing! There was lots of rides and food stalls and I really was surprised of the size of it! You can get in for free so that was nice. I went on Saturday evening so it was far too crowded, so I propably didn't enjoy it as much as I could have. Anyway, the park was absolutely lovely.||December 30, 2012
MsJanTiggy14||40||Visited on 14th December with my partner and loved it - I relky liked the lights and the beautiful market stalls. The live music was a real bonus as was the entertainment in the Bavarian house all free! Yes the drinks weren't cheap but it isn't in any major in events. It was magical.||December 29, 2012
peacefinallyfor||40||We took two 11 year old daughters and probably spent at least £170 on the day. Didn't take the older children as we couldn't afford it. The experience was wonderful and really brought the Christmas spirit to everyone. The ice skating was a shame as the ice was like a pond in places. We were the first group of people on the ice at 10am and it wasn't raining, but still very very wet and not good. The ice sculptures were amazing. Don't go down the ice slide at the side of the ice palace unless u want a very wet bum for the rest of the day. Drinks were £4 for mulled wine and £2.50 for standard bottle of coke - so take your own. Burgers and hotdogs were over £4 each as well. Other rides were around a fiver per person. Wonderful atmosphere and will definitely go again with lunch, drinks and socks.||December 29, 2012
Alexandra M||40||huge park, and while I was there there was a winter festival which was cute and had lots of rides and food. We thought the festival was big and then saw just how little of the park it took up!||December 28, 2012
carols9995||30||Hyde Park is vast. Difficult to spot the attractions as they're not clearly marked in the park. There'not as much to see here as other parks but you can watch the outdoor swimmers and there's plenty of room. Winter wonerland quite expensive. It's a fairground with some shops. The shops had unusual gifts. Very busy.||December 28, 2012
MrsSalvati||40||Dont miss speakers corner or Diana's memorial. A good day out - lovely surroundings, wildlife are brave and friendly. Winter wonderland in the winter is such fun - it's free to get in - drinks/food is pricey but good portions - lots of choice I reccomend the hot dogs/beer (stein if you love it) - if you have kids go in the day - if not go later when the kids go home tired and grumpy! We found the bavarian place was absolutely filled to the rafters with merry people singing german christmas songs and the macerena and all other music was such a good laugh! - If you CAN go - GO!Always lovely to walk about hyde park/london and enjoy our city.Enjoy!||December 28, 2012
Roving62331||30||Great park for a walk.....and big. Just sorry we where there on a day without people at speakers corner, hope to se some next time||December 27, 2012

ATWtravel_12||40||Winter festival was on at the time. Had a great time wondering around the chirstmas markets and eating crepes and drinking hot wine and chocolate. Atmosphere was great lots of people around.||December 27, 2012
Simon P||10||What a load of boring over-priced rubbish. Some of the rides (mini roller-coaster for example) are £6 per person for a 40 second ride x 5 = £30 for a family - rip-off. Just loads of the same stalls selling German hotdogs at £4.50 each and mulled wine at £4 a glass. I couldn't believe that so many people are will to be ripped-off - VERY DISSAPOINTED||December 25, 2012

We paid £54 for a family ticket and 1 adult ticket for the ice skating, ours was for 10am but arrive 20 mins early to get your skates and get in. The park doesn't open till 10 and there was an extremely long Q then we had to find the ice skating and Q again we got in about 20 past 10 the ice had loads of water on it which made it more slippy loads of people were falling over--we were the first lot of people on the ice. The rides were at least £2 each and some were more and young children needed an adult or another older child with them so it cost double. A hot dog all be it a foot long started at £4.50. So if you are rich all well and good. But if you have more than 1 child take out a second mortgage before you go. It is free to go in though.||December 24, 2012
Bigtraveller2012||20||Walked through the park hoping to have a look at the Serpentine and the nature of the park, but it was all covered in a huge temporary amusement park which seemed to ruin the whole park.||December 23, 2012
vj21||10||Went as treat paid for by grandmother with her and 5 children. The ice kingdom had some decent sculptures but others (the snow queen for example) that were partly melted and deformed looking. Long queues and over crowding for this even with pre paid tickets - v expensive, felt sorry for Grandma. Outside is a normal fun fair on a large scale - v overcrowded, noisy and muddy. Then got royally ripped off in Bavarian Cafe as were charged for sausage and chips seperately when had ordered them as one dish for set price. V small polystyrene cup half filled with tepid chocolate drink £3 each - didn't notice till too late stupid me!Avoid unless you fact being ripped off at Christmas together with hoards of other mugs. ||December 23, 2012
Frijolero||10||We have been to this in the past and it was great. It felt like a proper German market, not too big, some interesting rides, tasteful and very Chirstmasy, with good food.We went this year, today in fact. I don't know what they have done, but it was REALLY AWFUL & TACKY. They have TOTALLY ruined what was once a really delight.• It's lost it's authenticity. Many stalls are brands in disguise. Many of the hot chocolate stalls are actually Galaxy chocolate stalls. Jamie Oliver had a stall. Haribo sweets had stalls everywhere.We struggled to find any of the proper German stalls that were there before, although the one we did find was good but amazingly expensive.• It's way way way too big now and seemed to keep repeating itself.• It used to sell really interesting handcrafted goods, traditional wooden decorations, tin toys etc. Although there were one of two fo these, from what we could see few of these remain and now you will find lots of circus stalls, beer tents, fridge magnets and tacky plastic rubbish at extortionate prices.• It's very very expensive. £4 for a mulled wine, £7.50 for sourkraut, 1 sausage and potatoes. £5 for a German Sausage (just a sausage, no sourkraut).• It was packed, really packed to the point that it felt unsafe, especially with small kids.Because of all fo this the atmosphere has been lost. We found lot sof people were saying the same things as us which surprises considering the glowing reviews people have given it on this site.It may be better during the week when it's less busy, but we long for the Winter Wonderland of a few years ago which was about as close to a German Market as I've seen anywhere. Not the tacky mess/large funfair with stalls made to look slightly German selling complete tat that it has become.If you like funfairs, or Disneyland, or the 02 centre then you will probably enjoy it. If you want to go because you have been before and like German markets, then like us you will probably hate it.We wont go again, which is a shame as it was once so very good.||December 23, 2012
LittlemissPink2||40||I visited the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland on 23rd December 2012.It became very busy after lunch, so recommend visiting earlier in the day-especially if you have young children.There are ample cash machines, toilets and places to buy food and drink. Expect to pay typical London prices to eat (£3 for small portion of chips and £3 for hot chocolate)Other then some stalls, which do sell some novel gifts, Winter Wondetland is link a giant fair ground. Rides vary in price from £4 to about £7 per person.If taking a family of four- expect to part with £100 for the visit- unless you really are just going to look round- not that the kids will like just looking once they see all the rides. On the up side- enterence itself is free.There was a presence of security around the site and I thought it was quite a good family atmosphere.I suggest a visit there as part of a day out, rather then going for just Winter Wonderland- unless you are local.Overall the kids enjoyed it and amused them for around 3 hours.||December 23, 2012
MITawfik||50||Book one day at least for a tour from marble arch to Notting Hill and then to come back through Albert hall.||December 23, 2012
Roxburgh8||40||I spent a couple hours walking around Winter Wonderland and was impressed by the size of it and the attractions. It reminded me of a fair I visited in Hamburg a few years back. The rides are big and numerous (not like the rides that you would see in a local amusement fair). There are many places to eat and drink - don't walk into the first place you see take time to wonder around a bit. They also had free live music at various places in the fair and we watched the very good Houndogs roackabilly band while drinking mulled wine (you can get plenty of other drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). We didn't go into any of the circus events or ice skating so can't comment on them.It was very busy on the Friday evening we went though easy enough to walk around. Taking a pram around there might be slightly challenging with the crowds but not impossible. The prices charged for food and rides are probably not extortionate but it can add up when rides are around £4 each, a quarterpounder with cheese is £5 and mulled wine is £4 a cup.There are gift stalls were you can buy various Christmas related gifts. Overall I did enjoy the atmosphere and it was well organised. There are rides for different age groups including a whole area for toddlers and faster white knuckle rides for teenagers and adults - especially the overhead zip wire which is quite frightening. You could spend many hours there if you wanted to trying lots of the attractions like the circus show, rides and ice skating.||December 22, 2012
Lisa T||10||You would expect any attraction in London at this time of year to be busy, but they really should limit the numbers of people entering. We visited on the 15th of December and by about 3pm it was so over-crowded that you were struggling to move and certainly couldn't see anything! We enjoyed the ice skating and the giant observation wheel, but as we had been on our feet since 12.30 (there was no where to sit down- again the limited number of seated areas were full), we didn't feel able to spend another 2 hours battling our way around before we could see the Magical Kingdom at 6 pm, so regrettably we left earlier than anticipated. We live about 2 hours from London and this was meant to be a fun day out, but we would not bother again.||December 22, 2012
Fran H||10||The ice rink is in appalling condition it was more like a river than ice rink. My 8 year old lasted 1lap was pushed over & was soaked through to the skin. Was the end of his session. What a waste of money. Staff very unresponsive! Many people were also complaining and left. Will try a different rink next year.||December 21, 2012
cwansin||50||We walked pass Hyde park on our way to buckingham palace. Hyde park is clean and peaceful. Along the way the view is really nice too away from the hustle and bustle of the city. ||December 20, 2012
Ronny25||50||Just returned from london and visited the winter wonderland wow fantastic evening out and loved it! great atmosphere by all and loved all the little stalls.||December 20, 2012
Cat1Norfolk||30||Unless you want to spend a fortune and get covered in mud upto your knees, this attraction will take about an hour to walk around. We got there at 10am, it wasn't too busy which was nice. We heaeded straight for the Father Christmas and I must point out, he looked the best i've ever seen. However just the short walk from the entrance gate to the grotto made us all look like we'd been mud wrestling! Photos here are £8 each, however you can take your own which we did. I've never been to anything like this and the atmosphere was great. Plenty of places to eat and drink (at a premium). Bratwurst £5, candy floss (large) £5, mulled drink £4, pretzels £4.....there are plenty of cash machines though and now I know why!!We were here for roughly an hour and then continued with our trip to London. If I had one thing that I wish....it would be to bottle the smell, it was truly amazing.||December 20, 2012
NatttyB||40||Me and a friend booked to go ice skating here one evening! We arrived a couple of hours before our ice skating time.The ice skating: Really really good! We loved it. It was fairly busy but as the hour went on there was less skaters. People were civilised - no maniacs knocking people over. It had been raining heavily and this may explain why bits of the ice were covered in a layer of water. My only complaint is the cloakroom fee of one pound. You obviously can't take bags on the ice but I feel that after having paid for a ticket you shouldn't then have to pay more to leave your bag somewhere! And let's face it nearly all of us carry junk around with us!! The whole process of getting skates was efficient. In the centre of the ice rink there was a singer which was really nice :)The stalls: The stalls mainly sell over priced food - but I never expected it to be cheap. Cheap fairgrounds do not exist! All of the stalls sell much of the same thing, particularly mulled wine.The rides: a token system operates. We paid six pounds each (daylight robbery!) to go on some spinny chair things up in the air.The crowds: It was busy when we arrived at about five in the afternoon but once it began to rain the crowds died down. Note that there is hardly any shelter.Toilets: think I only saw one lot of toilets so hold on!!Age group: ice skating appeals to all ages but I think children under 12 wouldn't be thrilled as the stalls and rides are more aimed at adults in my opinion.Will I return? I'd ice skate here again and I'm glad I've been but I wouldn't rush back. ||December 19, 2012
aussiemama||20||Winter Wonderland, Hyde Park London - really!? WHERE?We schlepped in from Winchester for the afternoon expecting a Winter Wonderland of family fun and were sadly disappointed.Instead of a winter wonderland of white and calm, we found ourselves amongst a sea of people pushing and shoving their way around a huge fair ground. If we were expecting a fair ground we would have been very happy as it's a great fair ground.Lots of great looking rides, lots of beer halls, and food stalls, loud uncordinated music blaring from every direction; long lines of people waiting to buy tokens to spend on rides, very few places to sit and eat, and lots of very crowded drinking areas.Winter Wonderland implies Christmas, fun and cheer, family friendly activities.The walk to the area is pitch black, and felt unsafe in many ways. We thoroughly enjoyed walking thru the Christmas Markets as we left.it's not somewhere we would recommend anyone with kids under 12 years go ..... and if you've teenagers and they want to go with friends, follow them.||December 19, 2012
ThePoozle||30||Bright, shiny and very expensive. Good to walk through and have a look but the rides were costly, the queues long, the market place stalls full of the usual tourist tat and all very overpriced..||December 19, 2012
Ribena87||40||We visited winter wonderland on Sunday the 16th in the evening. It was busy but not manic you could walk about and queues were not very long. We decided to go on the fairground ride rather than one of the specified activities due to cost. It is all very expensive most rides are £4-6. The market stalls are lovely and they sell freshly made goodies. There is no need to eat before you go as there are so many food stalls. We drove to the attraction and found it easy on a Sunday night to park down one of the local streets for free.||December 18, 2012
aussiepapa78||10||We were expecting an enjoyable time with our young family, but left very disappointed. Still can't see the relationship to anything Festive, other than the signs on the rides have been changed - but ultimately they are the same rides. Plenty of places to drink, spin around and be sick; but nothing much to offer younger kids. Was not worth the effort at all.||December 18, 2012
bigcarl62||40||We spent a happy afternoon at the winter wonderland at Hyde Park.The atmosphere was really nice with people enjoying the fair and all the mainly german food and drink.Quite dear with a pint of lager £5.The rides were very dear also.A little tip if you want to experience a real fair visit Hull in October for the largest travellers fair in the Uk.||December 18, 2012
Glen1540||40||Winter wonderland is a magical place, it has something for everyone!There are several areas - there is the craft area as you come in that has many craft stalls, laid out well and uniformly presented. There are the bars towards the back - I like the Bavarian Beer Hall but if you would like a romantic date, go to the carousel bar (it is actually built like a carousel with the horses spinning around you.) The rides are fantastic too - there seems to be more and more with each year, howevber if you wish to use the rides they will set you back about £6 per person and the best time to go is during the day as queues at night are mental. I went with my girlfriend and my parents and had an absolutely fantastic time - the only thing to be cautious of is how much everything costs, as long as you are prepared that every drink will cost between £4 and £10 (for a stein) and that every ride will cost between £6 - £12 you will have a fantastic time!||December 18, 2012
luv2travel495||40||Went to the winter wonderland, Spinning Baubles will make you feel as if you've had far too much to drink literallty. Lots of arts and crafts from different countries. You will enjoy the food and entertainment also. On Sat night there was an ABBA tribute band.||December 17, 2012
Missdoublem||50||Loved Winter Wonderland again this year. Yes everything is a little pricey but its the experience tyou are paying for. It gets a big bigger every year for these Christmas Markets and def worth a visit if you are in London over the festive period||December 16, 2012
TammieTraveller||40||I took my 5 & 2 year old sons on a Sat. Thankfully, it was sunny & a little warmer than it has been so we didn't freeze. The boys loved it. We went to the circus & The Magical Ice Kingdom. Both are worth the money, but you have to pre-book online. They loved all the rides & food. I enjoyed the stalls in the Angel Market area. By post lunch it was very crowded & difficult to move around w/ the pram. However, we were never in a rush & everyone was friendly; we tried to be respectful of people going by. The queues weren't that bad either; hardly waited for anything we wanted to do. You have to expect crowds on a nice day in the middle of London at such a cool event. Plenty of stalls for mulled wine, got chocolate, & beer. only found one with mulled cider. Only complaints are that everything was definitely overpriced, so our fun day was more expensive than I would have liked. My son was jipped 1 token in change when I sent him on a ride; such a shame a 5-year old would be taken advantage of like that. I don't understand why they didn't spread it out a little more considering the park is so big.||December 16, 2012
lpb1966||20||Simply put this is a great setup. But it too busy with people to get any enjoyment.They would have done better to limit entrance people rather than charge £6 a ride! Less people would be more rides taken. Wall to wall people, lots with incredible orange tans and 5 inch heels, which gave me some fun watching them scream at their kids....as you can imagine some parents were not geared up for massive crowds.Sorry but avoid.....||December 15, 2012
ChrisF610||50||The Christmas crowds have arrived in their thousands and it'll take you an hour to walk end to end ( just from the constant flow of punters ) but it's Christmas in Hyde Park for goodness sake, what did you expect?The stalls, shows, rides and attractions are just there for the taking... The cirque berserk (zippos circus) is worth the entrance fee just for the mental motorcycling in the sphere of doom... Honestly, don't miss this, it's the most incredible stunt I've seen in years. The rest of the circus is routine and quite entertaining, but the bikes... Another level.The sky ride was special too. 200 feet in the air doing the chain carousel... Result.Grab it while you can...||December 15, 2012
charlotteannr||30||We went to winter wonder land today, it was so hard work trying to get a wheelchair around, it don't help it's so busy!!!!!! It was all in a very small space when Hyde park is so big!?! Loads of rides a bit like a glorified fair ground with loads of sweet stools, but I think we missed half of it because u couldn't see anything with a wheelchair! Over all I love to go again but with out the chair! Hope this helps! ||December 15, 2012
TimTravelr||30||At the center of central London, yet so peaceful. It's massive and take away the whole day when on foot. Nice spots where you can sit by a tree and catch up on your half read novel. A photographer can be as creative with his SLR, as his mind. And the kids can run around the park and catch up on their games with dad. Close, free and lovely.||December 15, 2012
Mandy M||50||Amazing, really enjoyed browsing the stalls , and bought afew Christmas novelties, also enjoyed some mulled wine!||December 12, 2012
Jay B||50||I came here ast year and it was brillant!But this year it's even bigger and better a lot more food and places to drink, they have spread it out more as well so it's not so crazy with people! The food is amazing the German beer is good and lots of different entertaiment going on for all ages!They have more toilets this year and more staff to help with problems.Try the Langas it's yummyI would highly recommend coming here!||December 12, 2012
Aditya S||40||Went there to check what's all about this Winter Wonderland. Turned out the place was very packed. Couples, families, friends gathered there. It was quite freezing. Free entrance but should buy tokens for attractions. There are ice rink, mulled wine, beers. Better go in the morning if you want to take children.||December 12, 2012
Lanerope||50||However you use the park, whether as a short cut, recreation, exercise or underground car park, this is great space with a fantastic atmosphere. The park effectively links a lot of key area of this part of London is well preserved and secure with a visible though discrete police presence. A great place.||December 12, 2012
sussexfella||10||Far too expensive and so crowded you could hardly move.Go to the Southbank one instead - great atmosphere and you could actually move from one stall to the next !||December 11, 2012
flowersingingman||50||I was a bit sceptical about a ‘Winter Wonderland’ in London but we had a day out in London and though we should pop over and take a look. I have to say I was really surprised! What a great day out!!We went on a Sunday afternoon and got there around 3pm. Its was packed out. A lot of people obviously go there to spend the afternoon drinking and eating. There are some really nice bar areas – some of the venues come straight from the German Octoberfests. One of the bar areas was on a giant old fashioned roundabout – very cool.There are lots of interesting shops – quite handy for Christmas shopping. The German saugage stands are around £4 a sausage and £4 for mulled wine. There is also a wide variety of other eateries such as a Jamie Oliver stand selling pork in a bap.There are loads of things to see and do at Winter Wonderland but you need to pre-book. So I would suggest checking out their website and making a booking.Although its free entry, you will end up spending money! So I would say take at least £12 per person minimum – and that’s just for eating and drinking. Its all cash mainly as well.||December 11, 2012
Linda04051984||50||In decembre there was a winter wonderland! We wen't there two times because it was so much fun. There are big and small atractions for the kids. Lots of food stands and little market stands selling all kinds of stuff in te winter/chrismas theme. In the middle there's live music at the bavarian bar. We saw magic mike twice. There's also a big oktober fest hall. We enjoyed our evenings here. Go there around 17.00 or so. It ends at 22.00||December 11, 2012
serko70||40||A perfect walk in the middle of London at any season. You can also ride horses and bicycles (available to rent). In summer you can rent boats, too.||December 11, 2012
Afflick67||30||I would really like to write that this was a fabulous experience and that we had the time of our lives. However, whilst we did have a good time it was just too busy and too commercialised.We went on a Sunday evening a just didn’t expect the throngs that we encountered. Moving around from stall to stall was very difficult and we were basically ushered along by the crowds with the occasional break in the tide for us to dart into a stall to get some mulled wine or browse some trinkets and baubles.The skating was brilliant though. For me, (as one who cannot skate), I found the ice marshal’s very attentive and helpful. The atmosphere on the ice was playful and respectful with varying degrees of skating abilities on show.I’m really not sure if I would come back to Winter Wonderland; which in essence says that I probably won’t.||December 11, 2012
AlessSG||40||The hyde park winter wonderland is a place packed with fun, food and generally merriment. I would reccomend going just to sample some of the food and get a feel for the place.Its wonderful for children with rides and carousels, and there's stands of beer and wine for the adults. The food is good- we wandered around and sampled bits from about 10 different stalls (which is only a fraction of the ones available).All in all, a wonderful experience.||December 10, 2012
Lynn_bo_11||50||My partner and i went to Winter Wonderland last Saturday It was fantastic it reminded me of the Chriskindle markets in Germany there was plenty to do for all young and old ,fantastic rides & plenty to eat and drink too ,well worth a visit entrance is free,rides a little over priced. Best time to go if you have young children is as soon as it open's preferably a week day as it gets really busy weekends. Family's with prams & push chairs will find it very difficult to walk round without saying excuse me lots & lots of times to get through the crowds.Must say everyone seemed to be having a great time, really gets you feeling the Christmas spirit.||December 10, 2012
tradmusicfan||50||We went to the Winter Wonderland event in Hyde Park, it was amazing-- all the attractions and food huts and gift stalls. There was something there for everyone young and old. Very enjoyable it even had a Zip wire!!!!! I would highly recommend this for families with children of all ages. One fault I would have is that its poorly lit at night it could do with more lighting along the paths of the park.||December 10, 2012
toftman||30||This weekend i treated the famliy to a day at the winter wonderland in hyde park london, As much at i wanted to like this day out a number of factors ruined the experiance,Firstly the commute to london was spot on from Essex with no problems. Got a big discount on f getting a group travel card 4 adult was £26.00. 50% DISCOUNT, Arriving at the park around 3pm we was confronted with a restrictive entrance and fount ourself and many many other people hearded in, along and past many stalles and attractions,and this was the theame for the whole afternoon, next was the pricing for the rides your told you need to purches ride token from a booth at a cost of a £1 per token, the cost of those ride are between 3 and 6 tokens per person, So the real cost of a ride for 3 adults and a child is around £20.00, if your planing on using the main rides you can spend quite a few pounds, be warned.the food looked a smelled fantastic and there is plenty of choice but again this was very expensive, for us 4 buggers and a drinks came to well over £35 ..I never got the chance to look at the stallls for any gifts or just what they was selling over all i think the whole attraction is a good idea, they really need to plann this event in future with more people in mind. spreading things out in a way you an walk freely seeing all you want to see with out beeing sqashed pushed along and over charged for every thing in sight,||December 10, 2012
lavender128||40||Walked from Kensington Gardens past the Diana Fountain and along the Serpentine. Beautiful crisp winter's day. Didn't go into Winter Wonderland, just viewed from across the lake. Lovely walk though and totally forgot we were so close to all the hustle and bustle.||December 10, 2012
enielle||30||We visited winter wonderland at hyde park as part of a weekend trip to london. The overall feeling I got is how expensive it would be to take a family there- although it's free to get in, you're looking at least £5-£10 for something to eat each (£3 just for some chips!), £3 for a bottle of coke or water, £6 for a tiny cup of mulled wine, £5 for a crepe or churros, £2-5 for each ride, and then all the stalls, extra attractions etc. The other attractions, like the ice rink, ice kingdom or zip line are about £15 each, just too expensive. I was a little dissapointed that there wasn't more of a christmas village of little stalls and shops to look in- there's a couple scattered around, and then a row of them by the entrance- but it was nearley impossible to look at any of them, because it was so congested near the entrance and exits.At around 11am it wasn't too busy except near the entrance, but later in the day it was horrible- you couldn't get anywhere, and too many people had brought buggies with them, causing road blocks and bashing the back of your legs with them trying to push through. They also closed the tube station as it got so busy. We went off for a walk around the lake, and enjoyed that much more than the winter wonderland!||December 10, 2012
Joe B||10||Felt it was dangerously overcrowded, did not feel safe there. Such a huge park and this "Winter Wonderland" is squeezed into it....why? Felt sorry for those with young kids & buggies. Could not wait to get out!||December 9, 2012
Elizabeth K||50||A beautiful park in it's own rights, but if you get a chance to see the decorations, food, and rides that they added in for Christmas even better!||December 9, 2012
Peeples15||40||I've been to a couple of winter festivities this year and Winter Wonderland was definitely the largest and most crowded. Crowded to the point that makes it difficult to really enjoy it. With that said, I bet on the right day it would be more enjoyable seeing that there is something for everyone to enjoy.||December 9, 2012
Amia_C||20||Expensive if you have a family. Not a great choice of food esp for veggies. Chips were over salted at all venues we tried. One in 3 mobiles contain poo, don't see much hand washing at food stalls. Lots of eating and drinking behind counters. I don't need to eat your germs. Boring same old stuff it seems year after yr. Really packed, so if you have a frozen shoulder do not go here, You get nudged all the time. The area needs to be much bigger to accommodate the ever increasing number of visitors and push chairs.||December 9, 2012
Happy123154||50||Although very crowded well worth a visit especially when dark,the whole place seems to come alive,the lights at the funfair are amazing,although crowded the craft stalls were nice selling some lovely gifts,plenty of food stalls selling a good variety of different cuisines||December 9, 2012
Carole052||50||Absolutely huge park, beautiful. Located close to Kensington Palace. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes, long walk. Squirrels in trees, takes beautiful photos||December 9, 2012
whiskywizard31||40||I visited the WW with my wife this year and last. It is a fabulous place to get you into the spirit of Christmas. Last year we learnt that if you want to visit any of the attractions inside then you will need to book. And so this year we did book the Circus three weeks in advance.The best way to get to WW is from Hyde Park Corner Tube Station as this is only a few feet from the attraction. It is free to get in but they make their money on lots of things inside the enclosure. Soft drinks, such as water or fizzy drinks are around £2 each and a beer is about £5 a pint. There are lots of stalls selling all these drinks as well as Mulled Wine and the like, so dont worry about stopping at the first you get to as they are all pretty much the same. As for food, this is also quite expensive with a medium chips being £4 and a burger being £6.If you know this before you head out there you wont be in for such a surprise and the quality of the food is actually ok, for what it is.At the moment (December 2012) there are so many people going to the site that they are having to only allow a certain number of people in at a time and 4pm-7pm seems to be the busiest times (families etc). Also, once in, you will have to queue for pretty much everything so please be patient !!When you leave, I suggest walking back to Embankment, Waterloo or Trafalgar Square, all are within 20 minutes walk and all are safe to get to. It will also stop you from having to beat the crowds to the tube.||December 9, 2012
samwei||50||recently visited the Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park. the location is convenient, just off from Marble Arch underground station or you can walk from Bond street to the park. a park is in the basement (payable). there are lots of various section in the park. food and drink area, ice skating area, games area, rides area. you may find lots of fun. I was impressed by the german pub in the middle of the park. the atmosphere was so high!||December 8, 2012
KhiamYeongH||50||Beautiful ecen in winter. As an added bonus, winter wonderland (a huge fun fair) is held every december (or so i am told). Come to the fun fair during daytime/weekdays so that the crowd is smaller and the queue shorter.||December 6, 2012
Sam_Rickelton||50||We visited the winter wonderland on a Monday teatime. We had been to Harrods earlier and found the Knightsbridge tube station to be well signposted and less than 10mins walk away.The atmosphere is so festive and is a feast on all of your Senses- look at all of the lights and open fires,, listen o the Christmas songs and live music, smell the gingerbread, candles and incense and taste the mulled wine.We spent £8 on a trip on the Ferris wheel which was lovely. As it wasn't busy we were. Given a pod to ourselves and you can choose different Christmas songs to be played. The view was great. Then we spent £5 on a glass of mulled wine with a shot of amaretto in one of the German bars which was very strong and warming.It wasn't busy at all when we want- no queues for anything. I would certainly take my kids back when they're a little older. The only thing is the price of the gifts for sale is expensive and can be bought more cheaply elsewhere.||December 6, 2012
Sue S||20||Really disappointing - like spending the day fighting your way through an overcrowded tube train. The fairground part was so noisy and ridiculously expensive - not easily affordable for most families. The pre-bookable events were very pricey too. The circus was ok - a bit of fun and my 10 year old daughter enjoyed that. The Ice Kingdom was nicely done but so small, much less than I was expecting. Hundreds of food stalls - ok, all selliing the same type of thing. The craft stalls had some nice products and we did buy a couple of Christmas presents but many of the stalls were difficut to get at because of the crowds. All in all it was a let down, when we had been hoping it was going to be an exciting start to the festive season. I won't go again.If you must go, visit on a week day if you are able to take your children out of school and avoid the rides unless you have good ear plugs and money to burn!||December 5, 2012
Daniel B||40||This is definitely a place to visit if you're planning on visiting London in December sometime. With free admission; a cracking atmosphere, Christmas market and (albeit ludicrously overpriced) fairground attractions it really will get you in the mood. There's a wide range of attractions, foods and shows on offer, so there'll be something for everyone. A word of warning though, steer clear on Saturdays, it can get unpleasantly busy||December 5, 2012
Geminican||30||It's definintely a beautiful park but it's huge. If you are short of time, visit Kensington Palace's garden or St. James's park. They are more manageable.||December 5, 2012
mcarchy||50||A great walk from all ends - especially as part of my walk from Trafalgar Sq through St james' and Green park to Hyde Pk and along the lake - passed Diana's memorial and on to the magnificent Albert memorial and the Albert hall.At winter time it hosts the brilliant Winter Wonderland with its scintillating ambience even if some of the acts are a bit downbeat.The northern end takes one to trendy hostel land and street artists.||December 5, 2012
Janet K||50||Took our 6 year old Grandson to see these and was bowled over, super, so much detail, well worth the trip.||December 4, 2012
Donbon||10||Well, what a huge let-down this was! My family (2 adults, 2 children of 12 and 10) got tickets to the Zippo's circus in Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland last Saturday night at 2100. We arrived well beforehand - hopefully for a spot of on the hoof dinner and a wander around the stalls. The whole area was heaving with people - thousands of visitors pushing and shoving and it was almost impossible to walk - what turned out to be quite a distance - to the circus tent. On the way we managed to grab a German sausage and a couple of glasses of mulled wine (which we needed in the end!) but we had no time, with the huge crowd, to look at any of the stalls, nevermind go on any rides (which looked very expensive anyway). I'm glad we didn't book to go ice-skating since that was very busy too - far too many people had been let in in my opinion.It took us over half an hour to get from the entrance to the Circus tent, and when we got there it was organised chaos. We were eventually shepherded around the back of the tent after the supposed 2100 start time - and by the time we got to the back entrance, everyone else had used the front entrance, chosen their seats and we were left right to one side and at the back - so our view of the high wire was impeded. The show lasted about 45 mins - but was very average apart from 4 motorbikes whizzing around a small cage for a few minutes. Random evil white witch / bride was a bit of a waste of space. The monkey men would have been better without masks I think - though what they did was quite clever. We came out, tired, fed up and faced with a long walk back to the tube. I piggy-backed my 12 year old (who has walking difficulties) most of the way. Both children were very disappointed and pronounced the evening a #fail.We won't return. Too many people. Too expensive. Not much fun at all in the evening.||December 4, 2012
HoppyUniatz||40||Worth going after dark to see the lights and watch the skating. Although I only went to have a look and a walk around it was a very pleasant way to spend an evening.Imagine A German Market; upmarket funfair; Ice rink, and winter exhibition all on a large scale and thats what Winter Wonderland is like.Good fun.||December 4, 2012
s00||30||A mish mash of fairground and Christmas market and for me it didnt work go the Southbank instead. Ice rink seemed popular though||December 3, 2012
chociq||50||Hyde Park is such a lovely place. Don't miss it. Make sure you visit the Rose Garden and The Serpentine lake. Buy some snack from Serpentine Bar and Kitchen and proceed to have a nice picnic in the park. Perfect!||December 3, 2012
Kat091078||20||After wanting to visit here for a couple of years was expecting better. Went during the day when it was still light so maybe in the evening it would be more magical. It was so expensive to go on the rides and the wait to see father Christmas was over 2 hours. I was very disappointed with the whole experience and wouldn't bother going back.||December 3, 2012
Paul W||40||Enjoyable stroll through the park lead us into the Winter Wonderland of rides and stalls; interesting and different German foods on offer and BEER. Good times ||December 3, 2012
Wifey26||40||Lovely park to spend time chilling out. Winter wonderland was lovely, but Hyde park is equally as lovely in the summer. Spending time here makes it hard to believe we are in a city.||December 2, 2012
JanetR537||50||Me, my husband and 22 year old daughter went here on a Saturday evening. We had a fab time it looked beautiful with all the lights lighting up the rides and stalls, very Christmassy. The group singing in the big bar area inside was great fun and always involved the crowds. The food was lovely we tried the German sausage and chicken and a lovely dessert of Spanish churros. We had mulled wine and beer too. The only thing I would say is the rides are expensive so choose carefully what you want to go on or take plenty of money. We payed 6 pounds each to go on the Wild mouse ride.||December 2, 2012
purrdy3us||40||I know it's busy and expected that..But ONLY one SANTA ??was my only gripe.. :-( My Granddaughter didn't get to see him it was a 2 1/2 hr wait plus he had a lunch break.. I think they should have had at least 3-4 santas I would have been willing to pay for a time slot too. :-(I would also suggest NO buggies on the weekend it was crazy busy..We never took ours..BTW its free to see Santa be prepared to wait a long time :-( It is muddy in places I would say wear boots OK the Circus was OK..but not worth the Money so don't waste it on that.. Only two good events/acts rest was utterly stupid. The ice sculptures were amazing but not worth the cost for 15 minutes or less..The Big Wheel was worth the money.. The Bavarian Bar area where the bands were performing was a fantastic atmosphere. (careful of pick pockets so I heard) Very crowded on Weekend When we were ready to leave (they closed Hyde park tube due to crowd control) it was hard to find Green Park tube and quite a long walk away if you have children. All I can say is you really are better off not taking buggy's WAIT until your Children are a little older!!! You would enjoy it much better without them..it was total chaos for us with one child of 6 yrs (no push chair) The crowds were very thick.. 10 pounds for a large stein of Beer (2.00) of that is deposit..or 4 pounds for cup of beer.||December 2, 2012
manchai||50||It's my third year to the winter wonderland in Hyde Park. It's got more fun rides and more places to eat and drink. I had a cup of mull wine to keep me warm while walking around. Then a German beer with live band and audience dancing. The pork leg was amazing with the beer! Loads of people and prepare to spend hours there!||December 1, 2012
JanRotherham||50||We had a lovely time at the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland. There are interesting craft stall and stalls selling lovely food. There are funfair rides for the children. The atmosphere is great.The only downside that we found was that it closes at 10pm - perhaps it could stay open a little longer at the weekend, but I suppose the stall holders have long days and want to get home.Its just the thing to get you in the mood for Christmas.||December 1, 2012
Kmart14||50||We visited Winter Wonderland on 30/11/2012 as a group of 4 adults and my 3 year old son, we traveled via tube and we got off at Hyde Park Corner tube station which has steps and a slope (perfect for pushchairs etc) and was a 2 minute walk to Winter Wonderland, we arrived just before midday and walked straight in with no queuing. I found this was a great time to go as the park was not overly busy or crowded at all at that time. Tokens which you buy for the rides are £1 each, and each ride is 2-3 tokens average for the children's smaller rides, and the adult rides are average 6 tokens per person per ride, so for 2 adults it works out that you pay £12 per ride average. It is best to try and work out how many tokens you need first as these can't be refunded at the end of your visit and are only valid for the day you buy them on, and the fair type stalls (e.g hook a duck etc) are cash only they do not accept tokens and these cost about £3 a go. We visited the "Santa Land" area first which is aimed at younger children with a great variety of rides and stalls for little ones, queuing time was minimal for the rides and on some there was no waiting time at all. This is where you see Father Christmas but the queue was very big so we gave that a miss. There are loads of places to eat and drink around Winter Wonderland with minimal queues at each, although they are mostly outside, we chose to eat at an indoor restaurant which was German themed although they did have English dishes available, I opted for chicken and chips which was pricey at £12 and a small glass of water was £2, so if you have a family of 4-5 it will work out very expensive, but we were in the warm and the service was brilliant and and the food was lovely and a good portion size and just to be able to warm up for a while it was worth the money! I don't think the other food outlets were quite as expensive but you will be sitting outside in the cold to eat, you can also buy crepes etc at various points around the park and these are between £3-5 each depending on your filling! There are lots "mobile" type toilets around the park, not horrible port-a-loos! We did not have to queue at all for the toilet. The baby changing facilities are also in a "mobile" with about 5 tables in each and each table had a changing mat on, the baby changing "mobile" is fantastic, enough room to fit everyone in, did not smell at all and it was heated so lovely and warm, perfect for changing little one's in without worrying about them getting cold. The ground at the park was easy to push a pushchair around on, we did not have to go over grass at all. The market is fantastic lots of different stalls, pricey but some interesting stuff. There was a few stages that had live bands on as it was getting towards evening. There is also a nice big undercover fire that is great for warming up around and you can get a drink from the bar there. We left the park at around 7pm and by this time it had started to get alot busier and alot more crowded. My advice if you are going with young children would be to go earlier in the day as my son managed to get on everything he wanted to without waiting and the adults also got to go on a couple of rides with minimal queue time and it was comfortable to walk about at that time with no crowds. All in all we had a fantastic time and will be back again next year!||December 1, 2012
Ian B||50||Just visited Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park and we were totally in awe of it all. It looks fantastic, lots of great craft stalls and food and drink in abundance. Plenty of attractions for kids and adults alike. You really get caught up in the Christmas atmosphere and a spin on the ferris wheel is recommended. if you want to get in the Christmas spirit you must visit.||November 29, 2012
nottheactress55||50||Took my mum to see the Winter Wonderland yesterday 28/11 and it really is a magical place. The rides were amazing and even though £6 for the chair plane ride, 60 foot up in the air, may seem to some a bit excessive.........this is no quick ride, you are up there AGES and comparing to what you would pay for a ride like this is one of the large theme parks good value for money. The stalls are so pretty and the beer keller was such fun. We joined in singing and dancing with the others, great fun!!! You are spoilt for choice when it is time to eat with so many wonderful things to choose from. Even little children are spoilt for choice when it comes to the rides.......and side shows. Thoroughly recommend it for a once in a lifetime experience..........but we will be back there next year as well!!||November 29, 2012
Zafren H||50||AMAZING! Honestly one of the most loveliest things to do in the whole year! Theres a beautiful atomsphere and such a lovely happy-go0lucky Christmas feel to everything! There's a number of things to eat and drink including a vast amount of sweet shops (yum!) and its just a perfect attraction to visit with family, friends or loves. The tokens are bit on the pricey side (£7 for a single adult ticket for the Ferris Wheel) but you go on it for a good 20 mins and you get to see pretty much everything from the top - its more like the london eye! To sum it all up... Perfect Day Out!||November 28, 2012
hmk24||50||We spent an entire day just wandering around the gardens. Kensington Palace is located at one end of the park. There are paths throughout. The Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. ||November 28, 2012
Inkerbelle101||30|| Last year was a fun way to spend an afternoon and evening full of craft stalls, rustic German food and a Christmas festive fairground and attractions including a very good daredevil circus by Zippos and a decent sized ice skating rink that wasn't too busy for the pre-booked hour I did it.This year was good too with a new attraction of a magical ice kingdom, with many wonderful carved ice sculptures, some small and some big including a castle to climb with an ice slide to go down.Most of the stalls were identical to last year but it's definitely worth going to Hyde Park for a look at the Wonderland running until early January.||November 27, 2012
Lynniepest||40||This just gets bigger and better each year and it's now free entry! A brilliant atmosphere and great fun for any age. Of course you have to pay for the rides and attractions though.There are lots of German style chalets with plenty of lovely christmassy goods to buy and lots of food and drink outlets with mulled wine and hot chocolate, waffles, donuts and many savoury foods to try. Some of the rides looked a bit high for me but are great fun for braver souls. If you like fun fairs this is the place for you.||November 27, 2012
enigma1259||30||Good for families with children but could be pricey. German style market stalls are ok but not like the real thing! Hot mulled wine is a must!||November 27, 2012
Anza_989||50||I went here with my friends during a visit to london. I had no expectations as i had never heard of it before. once we got there i was beyond amazed. it took us a good two hours to wander around and it never seemed to end! there was endless stalls selling food and gifts. in the centre there was a huge bar that from what i could see was not portable in anyway due to its enormous size!!! The rides there were also like nothing i have seen in a travelling site before too, amoung other things there was a huge zip wire, three rollercoasters and a ferris wheele. I will definatly visit this again if i go back to london before christmas! the only down side i could see was the price of the rides, but then again its london!!!||November 27, 2012
372wiz||50||Winter wonderland is amazing and does not disappoint. We traveled from Norfolk. The whole atmosphere is amazing and looks fantastic especially at night. We visited saturday night and Sunday all day. Staying over in a Hotel within walking distance. It rained quite alot and was very muddy and big puddles every where, so would recommend you wear wellies. But this in no way spoilt the fun. I visited with my 11 year old son and 12 year old Grandson. There are so many rides that would satisfy any adrenaline junkie, there fantastic far to many to mention. Watching people on the zip wire was hilarious as they hung above you. There is a minimum weight for this depending on weather conditions, Unfortunately we were not able to use this. But the kids found plenty of other rides to enjoy and scare there selves silly. We visited both the circus's, Magical ice kingdom and ice skating, (not one of my best ideas), as i was rubbish, but funny all the same, There were many others gripping on to the side trying not to fall over. The evening circus is worth a visit just to see the motor bikes. All the shows are very cheap and worth a visit. The fair rides how ever are not cheap. They ranged from £4 to £7 each. The zip wire being £10. So needless to say we spent a small fortune. Would be very helpful if the web site published this. So visitors can plan better for there budget before arriving. There were plenty of food out lets and the churos were delicious. Smothered in chocolate sauce. There are places to enjoy a drink and one bar had live music. We didn't have time to sit and enjoy this. We found all the staff very helpful and polite that we spoke to. if fiances allow we shall visit again next year. Having visited the once I think Ill be giving the kids a budget next year.!!! I would Highly recommend a visit. There really is something for every one to enjoy. Should you decide to visit I hope you have as much fun as we did. MERRY CHRISTMAS.||November 26, 2012
Isbj0rn1||40||Nice walk in the park. But bring some nuts. The squirrels are climbing on you! You can feed them from your hand or even your shoulders.. birds as well. close encounter with the nature:)||November 26, 2012
cat2Leeds||30||I love Hyde Park in the Spring and Summer but have never visited in the winter, so was excited to hear that they were staging a Winterwonderland whilst I was in London recently. Unfortunately, the event was so popular that the tube station staff at both Hyde Park Corner and Green Park were unable to cope with the amount of people wanting to visit. We were instructed to get off of the tube at Green Park and walk to Hyde Park, not normally a problem but in the dark and torrential rain, it became a nightmare. Once at Hyde Park, we waded through mud to get to the event. Everything on sale was overpriced and although the little wooden huts were pretty and would have looked nice with snow on, in the dark and rain everything became a little bit sad looking. We had a cup of mulled wine and some chips with dipping sauce - this turned out to be a tray of chips with a choice of tomato sauce or salad cream - not really what we could call dipping sauce in the UK. The winterwonderland experience is really just a large fairground attraction with some expensive food and drink stalls and a few typically overpriced Christmas market stalls too. We left within an hour and tried to get on the tube at Hyde Park Corner, which was not possible due to the amount of people on the trains themselves. We ended up detouring onto another line altogether, travelling all around London to get back to where we eventually needed to be.||November 26, 2012
dtowntravler||40||Finished up our trip to London by visiting the Winter Wonderland. It was fabulous. So many vendors with a German theme. There a rides and food to suit everyone. We went on the first night and so many wonderful things to see, eat and drink. A fun place for both children and adults.||November 26, 2012
JOESKY123||10||The event does not justify the high prices charged. London has a terrible reputation for being rip-off central and this Winter Wonderland is a typical example. Take the kids and you will need at least £100. Much less hassle and much more enjoyable to take them to the cinema for the afternoon.||November 25, 2012
ENTDOC-GREECE||50||You can spend a whole day here if you want and not being bored! There's everything from nice walks to restaurants and cafes, mini or maxi lakes, statues, works of art LOTS of squirrels etc.!!You simply feel you are somewhere else other than the Centre of LondonA must no doubt!||November 25, 2012
pedroingandia||30||I grew up in London during the sixties and seventies, and I have always been in love with this beautiful city. Hyde park is one of our largest London parks and a lovely place to stroll round the lake, have a row or even a swim. My favourite Sunday stroll was to the Round pond to watch the model boat enthusiasts and families flying their kites. This is a large park and if you manage a sunny day,a Borris bike is a splendid way to explore. Don't forget that Kensington, Harrods, the Royal Albert hall, the Albert memorial and the great British museums are all accessible from the park. OK, let's talk about the Winter Wonderland event. It's going to be busy and at peek times transport will be a nightmare. The underground service can get overwhelmed and often the stations will just close down until the backlog of passengers clear. At these times you will also find the buses are clogged and taxis all taken. The reason this event gets so busy is because it's free and really the only big Christmas event in London. So what do you get for your free ticket? Lots of sheds dressed up to look Christmassy and selling an underwhelming selection of hot sticky, gooy stuff. There's beer and sausages, hot chocolate, and toffee apples. When you have managed to negotiate the many sheds, you will arrive at the sort of events area. Here you will find an ice rink where you will be allowed to stumble round on the ice for a princely sum and asked to leave the arena after a not so princely amount of time. Then the circus, a tent with children's entertainment, always heavily booked. And then the fun fair. Good selection of rides, from quite hairy to little kids. Lots o kiosks selling more sticky gooey stuff. I must say that at night, with all the coloured lights and Christmassy decorations, you might manage a magical moment, but this will quickly disperse when you check your wallet later. The traders here are certainly not afraid of charging top dollar. If you want to experience this event, keep well away from weekends, make sure the kids have eaten before you go and limit the time you spend. Brisk walk round and get out. There's so much to do in London, so don't get caught with the 'Christmas must have for the kids ' stuff, Take care, Pedroofpobla||November 25, 2012

LeezMalaysia||30||This park is well known for its free speech corner & street artists so, if u feel like something is bottling up inside you just go there & let it all out & share it to people. Some cool concerts are staged there too especially in summer. This park is ideal for family picnic, lovers & strollers as it is close by the shopping districts of Oxford street, Bond street & Harrods are within walking distance tho' this park can be too vast to explore while doing some shopping. The last time l was there, l only went around it on a double-decker bus from Trafalgar Square on my way to Oxford street. l could see a lot of people chilling out on its grass under green canopies because it was summer in 1997. It is worth a visit!.||November 18, 2012
Elesath||50||Hyde Park is a real green lung of London. You can find people from almost everywhere walking around this place. Even you can find some places where you cannot hear the noise ofthe city and being likein the middle ofthe countryside. It´s a real great value for a city like London. Taking photographs from some smart squirrels is the main touristic attraction, apart from walking along the Serpentine shore.||November 18, 2012
grannyhall||40||Last year just before christmas I, my daughter and two of my grandsons aged 10 and 11 went to the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland. Firstly, I would like to say its FREE to get in, and boy, did we enjoy it, except for the rain lol. We booked the Ice Skating, Zippos Cirque circus and the big wheel (lovely views) a couple of days before we went (on their website) as we felt it would be busy, and it was. The boys thoroughly enjoyed it, so did we. My daughter and I liked the Xmas market, full of unusual things and goodies. There is also a large fun-fair, a bit pricey but good. There is loads of stalls to eat and drink, at reasonable prices. Give it a go, u will enjoy it and its open till 10pm.||November 17, 2012

alyssha_jade||30||Hyde park on a sunny day was lovely! We walked from regent street end down to the princess Diana memorial. There were bike stations where you could hire a bike and cycle around and drop it off at any of the bike stations. We walked around the lake where there were geese and a lovely little cafe at the end. Hyde park is a nice breath of fresh air from the big city.||November 15, 2012
bmflynn||50||I went to the Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park last year and was really impressed. Loads of lovely stalls for crafts, food and drink. The lights added to the atmosphere and it really helped get me into the Christmassy mood.||November 15, 2012
Anointednic||40||Been to Hyde Park numerous times at different points throughout the year. Always enjoy walking by the ponds. Love it (all parks actually) in autumn.||November 14, 2012
VCBS||40||We have been twice.It's undoubtedly impressive but very very expensive so be warned.It seems to be run by Germans as most food is from there not that I mind as I love their food but £6.00 for a curry wurst ??Still very impressive and great fun.||November 14, 2012
Eric G||30||Ending the evening on our trip, we decided to just walk the entire park. Walking from Piccadilly Circus we entered the park and went over to the Achilles monument(photo op) and carried on through towards the serpentine lake and to the Palace The Park is huge with isolated areas of attractions. Half the park is huge empty fields and its pretty flat. The sites they do have are scattered and some what not worth the visit unless you have a full day to lend to the park.The main attractions that should be visited is a nice visit to Albert Memorial where you get nice view of the hall and the statue. Then make your way over to the pond for a relaxing moment of feeding the ducks and finally cut over to main attraction which is the Kensington Palace. If you plan on doing the entire park do plan for atleast 6-8 hours plus plan on bringing a lunch or find a snack area near the serpentine lake.I would say that one should not take more then 2-3 hours and just hit the Albert hall, Pond for a quick light snack and the Palace. The rest of the park is just a huge park.As far best park in the world...I still have to give that to Central Park.||November 13, 2012
PyanS||40||Very convenient bike hire in the park. The park cycling area is very scenic with cycling path all the way. Much to see and and safe cycling.||November 12, 2012
AndrewPalmieri||50||Probably the best park in the world! This park has so much stuff going on, especially in the summer. This summer was the best with Hard Rock Calling and then all the free Olympic concerts and celebrations. Then in winter there is the one and only Winter Wonderland which is a great night out with family or friends, where you can sample some mulled wine, german beer or german bratwurst! This park is a must for all Londoners and tourists visiting the city.||November 12, 2012

DodgerLondon||40||The park is huge and only one corner (Hyde Park Corner) of it is anyway close to Buckingham Palace. I think the review below is mixing it up with Green Park or St James Park which are next to Buckingham Palace.It is nice for a walk and an escape from the city and could be compared with Central Park in NY in this way. ATM its a shame its becoming more (In)famous for the Hyde Park London Romanian gypsy site, which is a disgrace and ruining a part of the park for some visitors. Keep away from the Marble Arch part !!.||November 8, 2012
cpf79||40||It's a huge grassy area with ponds right next to Buckingham Palace. It's hectic, busy and noisy all the while being a peaceful place to relax. If you have food... watch out for the squirrels because they are very accustomed to humans and will literally try to take the food from your hands. ||November 5, 2012

Lorea M||50||This is one of the most famous parks in London. There is always something going on, escecially during the summertime. There are many concerts in the evenings. But if you simply want to walk, any time of the year suits.||November 3, 2012

Bryn C||50||The park is huge. There are tons of walking paths all around. People on bikes and having picnics all around in the summer time. Kensington Palace is alongside the park which is also worth a visit. Try to find the Peter Pan statue on the north side of the park!||November 1, 2012
KatieAmelia93||50||What a lovely walk in the park that gives a great break from the city. I visit this park nearly every time I am in London as it's so nice and relaxing! Even in the winter it is nice to be out here and get a hot chocolate from a stand! You see dog walked and squirrels and people also just strolling. It's famous and it's got to be seen if you are visiting London!||November 1, 2012

KyriakosSimou||50||Good place to relax in stressed london. Especially if it's a sunny day or if it's for a walk, jogging or CHRISTMAS VILLAGE :)||October 30, 2012
Sandra W||50||Hyde park is one of the lovliest places to go wether its for a jog. to relax or just to wander through. even when busy you never feel swamped as there is so much space. The princess diana fountain is worth a look here as well||October 28, 2012
ocecena||50||If you find yourself at London in a sunny day, don't hesitate and go to take a walk in Hyde Park. You can see Albert's Memorial and enjoy a great time walking by the lake.||October 28, 2012
margaret b||50||Sometimes I want to stroll in a park or garden when I visit cities.Hyde park is one of my favorites because I have spent much time there and have had some great experiences there. I don't like the fact that there aren't many public toilets and after all that tea I've consumed, I have to get creative in solving my problem. ||October 27, 2012
SquirrelyCody||40||And it's bigger than you think. Have fun at the Lido - you can swim, take a boat, sit at the cafes, rollerblade, cycle, walk - in fact you can go all the way from Kensington Gardens, through Hyde Park, Green Park and finish at St James's Park - recommend this on a bike and on a dry day!||October 27, 2012
Cooperman59||40||We visited Hyde Park to relax after a couple of days visiting sites across London. It was a nice day so strolling through the park was a pleasant experience. It was a far bigger park than I expected but that shouldn't be an issue for you unless you struggle to walk far. The main paths are very wide and flanked by trees which allows pedestrians and cyclists to use it together easily. There were also occasional small places to buy refreshments.We walked the full length of the park and down before turning towards the Serpentine. The walk was considerable but well worth it. It was a lovely lake to walk around with plenty of water birds such as Cormorants which I must admit to not having seen before.Last but certainly not least I need to mention the squirrels. They are cheeky to say the least and come charging towards anyone that comes along. I held out my fingers to tease one to come closer so that my girlfriend could take a picture. When I held my hands up the squirrel didn't stop and ran up my leg towards my arm to look for food. I won't do that again as its claws were sharp!A great park and very relaxing. Make sure you like long walks but enjoy the views.||October 25, 2012
l r||50||Park is in great location of the city. Hundreds of acres in the middle of the city. Walking trails, biking and just a great place to unwind. Many buses and close to upscale shopping.||October 25, 2012
Laura H||40||Lovely scenic place, plenty to look at. Saw the HHCR riding their horses which was a beautiful sight||October 24, 2012
mgtravles||50||I love running through Hyde Park when in London. It is expansieve, clean and safe. A couple of laps around the Serpentine and I'm ready to start my day.||October 23, 2012
biswasindranil||50||The Hyde Park to me is one of the most beautiful places in London.. The areas around the Park are orderly , posh and historic .I stayed in the Victory Services Club on the Seymour Street near the Marble Arch while in London and spent about two to three hours in the morning every day in the Park. I liked the concept of bikers pedaling around the electric bikes, the riders on some of the most beautifully groomed horses trotting by , the joggers jogging past with ear phones, the casual sitters on the benches who had grabbed a sandwich from the Pret and Manger across the street . THE WHOLE place is very very atmospheric . The sign postings make going around easy and with three tube stations around the Park , coming here is very easy. The restaurant by the Serpentine Lake and the lake itself within the Park was lovely . Every corner had an element of surprise and there were so many areas to explore. The Lady Diana memorial , the Regent Park , the famous Exhibition Road with all the famous museums are all accessible through the Hyde Park . I reckon the layout of the European Part of Kolkata ( Then Calcutta) towards the East of Fort William upto Park Street and Chowringhee was inspired by the areas around the Hyde Park .Calcutta incidentally was the second biggest city of the British Empire after London . I stuck up very lively conversation with people from many nationalities there. You have the police, the ambulances and volunteers of the National Health Services to handle any kind of emergency . To me the HYDE PARK is as iconic as the London Bridge and the Big Ben. A must go destination if one is in London. All citizens of the Commonwealth countries will find London to be one of the best cities in the whole world as their modern character and heritage of the last 200 years is invariably linked to this historic city .||October 21, 2012
Travel-n-Mark||50||Nice area for safe, quiet walk or bike ride. good access to many other London sites. Connects to Kensington park as well so you can make a day of walking or biking and never see the same thing.||October 18, 2012
KatiaP852||50||Good place to let kids run off some energy. Brilliant people watching spot. Liked the roller skaters showings off :-)||October 16, 2012
LeeLeeAnn||40||We had a great time walking around the park. We liked looking at the Swans, ducks, squirrals and pigeons (all looked well -fed).||October 15, 2012
oldhickory5||50||Parks like this are so important to residents of major world cities like New York City, Paris, & London because so many people live in flats or condos with virtually no individual lawns. So, what a respite it is to be able to enjoy the out-of-doors in a place like Hyde Park. My wife and I only spent a short while here while we were on our trip but it was important to just see such a historic London park. We made it to the Serpentine on the south side. I would have liked to go to Speakers Corner, but didn't have the time. For anyone coming to London, I'd encourage you to spend some time in a London park such as Hyde just so you get away from the traffic and buildings of the city. And, by the way, we entered the park from the direction of Knightsbridge subway station, which also happens to be next to Harrod's department store. So, you can see a couple of famous London sights on the same excursion.||October 15, 2012
denizov||50||Wonderful park in the very heart of the megapolis. It is a wonder that Britons have managed to keep a whole string of parks in the very centre of one of the most expensive cities in the world where the prices of land are sky-high. We should all congratulate them on that. Hyde park is excellently maintained: I saw people cleaning, watering etc. It is very versatile: open green meadows, century-old trees ( another achievement through the ages), flowers, bushes...you name it. I saw Rotten Row where people can enjoy horse-riding which is another attraction of the park. The Serpentine creates the impression of a sea-coast and it has also the waterfowl to enliven the scene. There are benches everywhere and they are a perfect place to relax after the crowded streets, shops and avenues of the gigantic city. There were very few people and I really got the impression that I am somewhere in the English countryside--a wonderful feeling because I do not like big cities at all. I could not see everything for lack of time ( and the park is enormous) but if I go to London some day again, I will make sure to visit Hyde Park again.||October 13, 2012
katherine j||50||have been there in all seasons best place to be for a bit of people watching. Love watching the wildlife as well as the people||October 13, 2012
dollymixtureHarrowUk||40||Went to a free concert/screening. Enjoyed Lady Diana Memoral Fountain. Kids loved the park area. All in all for free sunny days an ideal venuex||October 12, 2012
KimmieT8||50||It was such a short stay for us and occasional rain in the mornings. Next trip we would bring our running gear and jog in the park, simply breathtaking. It's a lovely park and gives you lots of privacy to do your own thing.||October 11, 2012
Louise T||50||We hired bicycles and covered all of the park. Then covered it again by foot. Beautiful.We ate at both restaurants over the weekend.Fabulous sculptures.||October 9, 2012
Douglas S||50||Hyde Park is a great place for a run. Kensington Gardens are generally less busy than the east side of the park.||October 8, 2012
andyk0210||50||Spent a little time here and found it to be a a relaxing, well maintained park. Being autumn the flowers are on the wain but you can still see the beauty of the place. The squirrels are the most brazen I've seen||October 6, 2012
Sandy F||50||Hyde Park is huge and is right in the heart of London. You can bicycle or go horseback riding on Rotten Row. The road that bisects the park is closed to vehicular traffic on Sundays. You can take a leisurely stroll on the Serpentine. There is a huge pond replete with geese, swans, and other resident birds. Hyde Park is also home to the Princess Diana Memeorial Fountain and a childrens playground built in her honor. There are paddle boats available for rental, should you want to venture onto the pond. Food and beverages are available on the grounds. The park also has a small gift shop. The vibrant colors of the changing of the seasons cannot be beat. It is a great place to exercise, take a slow stroll, or pull up a bench and people watch. Hyde Park is very close to a great shopping area that is home to two London landmark stores - Harrods and Harvey Nichols. Very pedestrian friendly.||October 5, 2012
DougofMelb||50||What a magnificent park to have in the heart of a big city. Walking along the Serpentine; watching the swans and geese; feeding the squirrels. This park can provide bored young children with hours of entertainment - collect some of the fallen chestnuts and take them to the park near Buckingham Palace and let the kids hand feed those squirrels to the delight of the kids and those passing by.||October 4, 2012
Phylly M||50||We spent a few hrs at this park.. Saw as much as we could see..The pond..the lovely gardens and the Diana walkway---it is a park for everyone-- it is huge and seems to go on forever---||October 1, 2012
xarmejnzizzi||50||It's very big so get ready to spend a whole day or afternoon there. It's wonderful especially if you come from places where you don't have parks (like we do). I come from a small island so being able to let my 1 year old stroll and run around in the park was great!!! ||October 1, 2012
norman_bates_82||50||I love this park. It is THE park that defines London to me. I have been coming here for years and still love taking a stroll whenever the weather permits.It can get quite busy during summer but there are always little hidden spaces or gems to relax in. There are many shops near by.. depending what exit/entrance you go through so always near food and I'd definitely recommend a picnic during summer.There are loads of festivals there every year and special events. You can cycle, jog, roller skate, play football and other sports if you like.If only England was more sunny :(||September 30, 2012
Peter A||40||If you ride a horse or a bicycle this is a real haven for you. No bike you can hire a Boris Johnson Barclays one, if you can find one in the locality. A very big park with Hyde Park Corner, Speakers Corner - a great place to listen to cranks and have a laugh, Site of the Serpentine and the Albert Memorial. Kensington Palace is very adjacent as is the Royal Albert Hall. Lots of sporting activity in the Park. Well worth a visit.||September 28, 2012
UKFlaxy||50||This was my end time at this event and it is fantastic, the flag waving brings a tear to your eye. Everyone well behaved and a very friendly crowd. However this year there we over 40,000 and space was at a premium, in the end I fgelt so hemmed in that I upped sticks and moved to the back. I think secutiryt should stop people from setting up on the pathways, this could be a hazard. However once again I had a fantastic time, missed Rolf though!!! Will def booked again for next year. As a general note regarding the Park I have spent many a happy few hours just sitting in a deck chair next to the Serpentine soaking up the sun and watching the world go by.||September 28, 2012
harriete||50||Lots of little coffee/tea shops, so you can sit outside in the sun, over looking the lake, and take in the views. Lots of people walking, jogging, walking dogs, kids running round - just how a park should be - its great!||September 25, 2012
Michał L||50||Great place to relax in the middle of the city. Particular compliments go to the lake going towards the Serpentine for nice variety of waterfowl, including Canada, egyptian and greylag geese, several species of ducks, herons, cormorants and grebes (well, their chick really could shut up for a couple seconds every once in a while) :)Very rotund woodpigeons.||September 25, 2012
BigBadJohn||50||Took some friend from Czech here as they wanted to see it and they were very impressed! It is very easy to walk to and from many of London's landmarks, must be done when you visit! If you go on a Sunday visit Speakers Corner. An experience in its self!!!||September 25, 2012
Elmlea77||50||I love going to Hyde Park, it's great for seeing people doing all sorts from roller blading to yoga! I go here when they hold Winter Wonderland here. I've been here for a concert too, I like walking round on a summers day||September 24, 2012
melmoff||30||Spent most of the afternoon and evening at Proms in the Park Great event, marred by the absolutely terribe security arrangements, no prizes for guessing the company. People had to queue for an hour in 90 farenheit....babies and the elderley found it very difficult. Security staff at the end of the line were poorly trained and not really up to any meaningful inspection work. The BBC should get their money back.Entertainment and crowd were great though and we will do it again...although as usual not enough Female toilets. when will event organisers fix that problem?||September 24, 2012
Rarityfan||50||Me and a group was in Commodore Hotel nearby.If you need a break from the crowd and traffic go here.I recommend over three hours here.Wish I had been here under the Proms, but happy I was not after watching the crowd on TV.Food is availabe in the many suburban restaurants.||September 24, 2012
di_baker||40||If staying ion London, Hyde Park is a great day for relaxing. On a Sunday go to Speakers Corner. A mixture of people on their 'Soap Boxes' expressing their passion.||September 23, 2012
mandy c||50||this park is just gorgeous, enormous and vast, great place to chill out in the sun, run, walk, picnic. i went there to have a break from shopping in central london, just loved being there especially by the lake (serpentine), be sure to have a good walking shoes as you have to walk a lot to reach the lake.||September 20, 2012
kittybz||50||Went there on a Saturday outside was like 30 degrades and it was perfect. inside the park you can actual use the facility of paying a small amount of cash and have a bath and tan also, perfect ||September 19, 2012
randjlloyd||50||Wonderful and patriotic evening. The queueing to enter the venue could have been better organised and the refreshments could have been more reasonably priced but this did not spoil our enjoyment. we are hoping to attend next year.||September 18, 2012
SpartyGirlUK||50||Another fantastic park in London. The park is vast and a great place for a cycle, run, walk, picnic, whatever. ||September 18, 2012
Domenikos P||50||This is what I call a park. It's like being somewhre else and not central London. I would love to be able to take a morning every day there, just to get my head clear and the off to work! amazing park||September 14, 2012

Plym G||50||Huge park, very busy. Bikes to hire which are fun, free for 30 mins or £1 for an hour. Cards only - no cash. Boating lake totally stunning. Padalos available - £8 for about half an hour. Worth a. Visit and easy to get to.||September 10, 2012
L4-Doha||40||This is a park similar to any other park, the only difference is it thatits located in the middle of London. Nice for a few hours walk or a run for those who are fitter. Location ideal as it connects to some of the tourist attractions.||September 10, 2012
Sarah G||50||Almost everything, would be good to have all those on seats behind the people who sit on the ground!! people were very territorial over their space and were also greedy, 0ne party even had their chairs bound together in a square and bound it with flags, as I said people were greedy by taking the space for 3 others to sit!||September 9, 2012
Aida M||50||For readers! writers! meditation! exercise! .... for a short or long escape from whatever you are doing in London. Great cafe with real food, from hot breakfast at very affordable rates with the best views and great outdoors, great pizza, to Salmon cakes, great baked goids with goid coffee ...to much more... You can spend one whole day or two or more like I did ...writing and reading. Without missing on the shopping ! ||September 9, 2012
Johnny J||40||A nice place to get the shoulders down and relax between all the shopping. There is a lovely scenery.It's a fun experience to be able to get close to the many squirrels that are in the park, with some peanuts in your pocket, you are fast friends with them (see pictures)||September 9, 2012
bercayu||50||It was during the Olympics I went there, so it was a bit hectic. But it is so big that you can't see all of it. Don't need to see all of it, just near the Marble Arch do people spend time mostly. So go and check it out.||September 5, 2012
aprinkibas||40||It really is breathtaking, and very very big, took us over an hour to walk from Hyde park corner to queensway but was worth it x||September 4, 2012
whiteprince||50||Enough to see and do for a walk or even better for a long run around its perimeter. Well located for any tourist visit.||September 3, 2012
483ChristineW||50||The Princess Diana trail was lovely with the beautiful roses and flower gardens and the water feature, so beautiful. Plenty to see.....have never seen so many squirrels around my feet. Well worth taking a break away from the hectic streets of London.||September 2, 2012
bechbh||50||My mum and I spent one of our last afternoons in London cycling around Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens using the TFL City Cycle. I probably cannot emphasise enough how lovely and enjoyable this was. After the hustle and bustle of London non-stop for 6 days, it was so nice to take it easy (and get some exercise as well). We hopped off the underground at Hyde Park Corner and picked up two bikes at the first entrance we found to the park. There was a bit of a queue and some confusion about how to use the hire machine (some people didn't have credit cards - this is a must), but once we had our bikes, we were ready to go!We cycled around both Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, stopping off to look at monuments as we went. Mum and I were in London in May, so it was still light at 6pm when we went and the Park was full of people relaxing on the grass. The only thing to watch is the parts of the Park where bikes are not allowed. Usually this is on the narrow tracks up to memorials. On the whole, this wasn't much of an inconvenience.I recommend visiting the Round Pond, Peter Pan Statue, Princess Diana Memorial Fountain and 7 July Memorial. Hiring two bikes for 2 hours cost 6 pounds. Without hiring bikes, we would not have had the opportunity to see so much of Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens.||September 2, 2012
KarachiKhawaja||50||No doubut it is always good to walk, especially morning walk. We used to write essays in exams on mroning walk at 5th level. The Hyde Park, England is one of the most popular tourist destination in the world. On one side is Bayswater and on the other Marble Arch. Nearby roads leading to Oxford Circuls, Piccadely and Trafalgar Squre. ||September 1, 2012

WellTraveledEthiopia||50||Beautiful warm day so decided on a walk in Hyde Park. Visited the Diana Memorial then had lunch in a lovely little cafe overlooking the lake where lots of people in boats were aimlessly floating about soaking up the sun. Another long walk after lunch.......so peaceful, green and lush and where people from all walks of life were just enjoying strolling. Definiely worth a visit.||September 1, 2012
karen f||50||So much goes on at HYDE park , its not just a park its a place of fun laughter, games , rides, Christmas Cheer! Music, the Arts.||September 1, 2012
Bangton||30||Hyde Park is nice enough but it was a little underwhelming. Maybe it's because we have a beautiful park near our home or maybe we went at the wrong time but it wasn't what I thought it would be considering it's fame. We did have a nice relaxing walk there though and I would like to visit the Christmas fair but I wouldn't hurry back when I'm next in London!||August 31, 2012
JoyFancuttBurger||50||A park that holds music festivals, that you can drive through is impressive, no matter where you come from. It's a lovely tranquil place to walk, picnic, cycle or drive through or just to commune with nature.||August 30, 2012
symbol003||50||We visited Hyde park on the 18th August and we re really surprised how beautiful it was. We especially enjoyed the italian gardens, I could of stayed there all day||August 30, 2012
amandaandjamesbrooks||50||Well worth a walk through the park - such a beautiful setting and the pedaloes were great fun on the lake. Made it better as the sun was shining on our walk though the park from Knightsbridge to Marble Arch.||August 29, 2012
Toby T||50||An amazing park with a wonderful atmosphere!The things i didn't like about Hyde park was that there were not a lot of toilets||August 28, 2012
Kazzu||50||Whenever you visit, there is always something different in the park. Being in Central London makes even more special. Its not far from Oxford street, so a little unwind in nature is perfect||August 28, 2012
Traveling_Dad48||30||almost as much as their pubs. More skin on display than your average North American beach as well. This was our second park in the UK and our first picnic with relatives from around the area. Despite an early afternoon shower, the sky cleared up and the weather was good for the rest of the day. We were in the Rose Garden section, under a large willow with kids playground, WC and east end of "The Serpentine" all nearby. Very casual atmosphere, with dogs, children, beer and picnickers all in abundance.||August 26, 2012
Zot||40||Plenty to do in Hyde Park but especially fun on a hot day is a trip to the Lido -swimming section of the lake. You pay £4 and you can stay all day. There is also a children's section with paddling pool, sandpit and adventure play and a place to sit and eat snacks/get drinks. A full day out! There are lots of other great things to do in Hyde Park such as hire a pedalo, bike rides etc. ||August 25, 2012
Timothy_Ruhle||50||The famous Hype Park. Bring along a picnic, book or whatever you fancy; this is the place for it. A great park with lots always happening||August 24, 2012
MommaScams||40||Hyde Park is a lovely place to spend a sunny London afternoon. I visited the city for two weeks, and after seven or eight days of sight-seeing and history, I needed a break. Not wanting to sit in solitude in my hotel room, however, I decided to pack a lunch and sit in the park. During the summer there are striped chairs placed in the park for those looking to sit, but I found this area was a bit crowded and moved away to sit on m blanket under a tree. It was beautiful and green, but not the quietest or most peaceful park I've ever visited. A great place for families to picnic or friends to play catch, and a wonderful place to people-watch!||August 23, 2012
Hammercounty||40||Another nice park, open and easy to wander around. Closer to town centre than Kensington Gardens. Lots to see especially through late Summer and milder weather||August 21, 2012
djboro||40||lovelly large park, 15 walk from the ritz hotel.... loads to see and do.... italian garden. serpintaine lake which you can swim in and is spring feed.....liads too see and do great place to explore.... and rent a boat or pedalo out on the lake.... parking avialiablenumberous cafes and eat places...nice place to exercise and recharge batteries in london.... maps and walks highlighted||August 21, 2012
The_Original_Dodger||40||The winter markets is over on the Kensington side of the Park near Hyde Park corner near the underground station. If you have something to eat in one of the many temporary snack bars which offer different styles of ethnic foods and drinks you can walk off some of the calories though the park to Marble Arch underground station. You could divert to see the Princes Diana memorial. ||August 21, 2012
sten28||50||great place to find some peace amd quiet. lots of grassy areas to have a picnic or read a book and so many different things to see.you can stroll around the serpentine and hire a pedal boat, there's a lido children play area several place to grab a bit to eat and now you can hire one of the London bikes- fab place to visit||August 20, 2012
japsara512||50||The perfect way to spend a summer's day... We were here on Sunday and it was an unusual, but lovely 30 degrees out! The park was packed with people having picnics, cyclists, horse riders, skaters, dogs and everyone was making the most of the wonderful weather. We decided to be brave and instead of the usual pedalo decided to take a row boat out on the Serpentine. At £10.00 pp it's not exactly cheap, but we spent a fantastic hour rowing around the lake - definitely something I would recommend! We then had a late lunch on the terrace of the Serpentine Bar & Kitchen (reviewed separately but was wonderful!) followed by a couple of hours sat on the grass watching the skaters and their tricks. This is definitely something to see and they really are amazing at what they do, basically it's free music & entertainment! Hyde Park is huge and you can rent a bike fairly cheaply to get around or simply walk for hours. Squirrels and birds abound and you can feed the swans & geese on the lake. You can actually even swim in the lake in a large segregated area but when we were there the queue was huge! The gardens and statues are beautiful and you could definitely spend the whole day there - we will definitely be making a regular return!||August 20, 2012
debbywv11||40||A fanastic place to stop for a picnic lunch, lots of lush, green, well maintained grass super to watch the world go by||August 20, 2012
Rana E||50||my favorite park in london so relaxing yet full of activities don't forget to get a tour with horses there, really love the beauty of this park||August 19, 2012
LeahAinsworth||40||the area although very busy as it was the Olympics was a nice way to sepnd a day walking and talking just relaxing, loved the Dianna memorial fountain just filled with children playing in it rather than some fuddy duddy thing thats cordened off she would have approved :)||August 18, 2012
UniqueCritique2012||50||Wow, this would be the place for exercise if you lived nearby! It is a great place to bike ride and walk. (They do rent bikes, but I didn't use those services.) I became a bit tired, and that was even with part of the park closed off the day before the Springstein concert. So, I didn't see all of it, but what I did see was fantastic. My only disappointment was "Speaker's Corner." I was under the impression that someone was speaking there all the time. It was a bit of a downer to find it empty, but it was nice to have the education.The walkways/bikeways seem endless. I don't think I've ever seen a people appreciate and use their greenspace quite like the Brits! It is refreshing. Enjoy!||August 17, 2012
Ruth B||40||Great place to relax and enjoy the scene. Beautiful garden and home of former royal. Include on your itinery||August 17, 2012
natashao524||50||I have been here for gigs, picnics, events and just a general walk. The park is so big that I don't think I have got round all of it but I intend to.||August 17, 2012
Terry4206||40||A wonderful place to walk around but be prepared for how big it actually is and how many different paths you can take through the park. Visited during the Olympics so was very busy and alivesonot sure how "peaceful" it actually becomes. Found Kensington Gardens to be much quieter. ||August 16, 2012
PortofinoGuest ... P||50||its huge and you can sit around the ponds, go cycling or horseriding and the there are houses and another small Palace where all Lady di's clothing is displayed...you have to pay to see these though..||August 15, 2012
paradise Palms ... T||50||During the summer holidays my wife and I took our two kids to central London and whilst walking around Marble Arch we ended up in Hyde Park. We first stopped by the Speakers Corner which can be used for persons who wishes to debate or for public speaking. I was informed by a guide that in the early days this spot was used for public hanging. During the London Olympics 2012 the Serpentine river was used as part of the Triathlon and this was televised worldwide. In this park we saw a lot of people on bikes, some jogging, some having picnics. You can get food to buy at the park and there is a fountain there that is a memorial for Princess Diana. Go ahead and take your family to Hyde Park, you'll love it.||August 15, 2012
lacost69||50||Hyde Park is a lovely and peaceful area to get away from the noise and hustle & bustle.Quite a few underground stops around the park, we used Hyde Park Corner.This was just a few minutes walk from the 7/7 memorial which I recommend anyone should visit. Nice to spend a few tranquil moments in a quieter part of London to reflect and remember those who lost their lives. A lovely park.||August 15, 2012
HazelD633||50||My 16 year old refused to get on a bike so we left her in the sunshine and after about 10 minutes of my husband having to check his patience working out how to operate the machines 3 of us got on our sturdy bikes! They are really heavy and I'm afraid to say not designed for the feminine shape ...... but we got a good look around Hyde Park and whizzed along the cycle paths avoiding pedestrians and children who don't seem to know what a picture of a bike on the tarmac means! It is years since I have been to Hyde Park, and I'd forgotten how big it is. Lovely lakes, plenty of restaurants, felt very safe and gave a great view of London. We intend to come back in Autumn when I'll bring my padded cycle shorts ......||August 15, 2012
Sam B||50||Attended the 'Olympic Closing Concert' at the weekend and it was amazing, We walked all round the park & it was beautiful, tree lined, calm and outstanding.The parks public toilets were very clean, bright, piped music & free!Well worth a visit with several important yet beautiful mimorials.Nearest underground was Hyde Park Corner||August 15, 2012
AndyWildman||50||A great park with lots to see and do. Consider hiring Barclays bikes for an hour and cycle around the perimeter. ||August 14, 2012
Anne Y||50||Hyde park is great for a stroll, a run, or to just people watch. It's beautifully landscaped, big, and a nice getaway from the bustle of London.||August 14, 2012
millie t||30||Beautiful park - it's a London icon and there is always something going on. There was even a triathlon going on when we went there recently!The perfect place to spend a sunny afternoon, enjoy a picnic or simply get some fresh air on your lunch break. A peaceful space that's rare in central London.||August 13, 2012
Bingley1||40||We went to watch the Olympics in the park and the organisation was first class. The facilities were excellent. I would like to spend time wandering around the park on an ordinary day.||August 13, 2012

AussieSuzie53||50||A lovely part of London. You didn't even feel like you were in the middle of such a huge city. Would love to have been able to explore it more fully. Next time I will defintiely spend more time seeing all its sights||August 9, 2012
Biancoulli||50||a place to be during christmas for all the family. Brings back memories from my childhood. the best christmas treat||August 9, 2012
Estherann127||50||Spent 3/4 hours in the park,,,first time we went we had breakfast at the Lido on a perfect day with sun and blue sky, watchinfg people swimming in the Serpentine! This time we went to watch the Brownlee brothers in the Olympic triathlon! Brilliant Gold and Bronze medals||August 8, 2012
Halfom||40||Relax, take some time of shopping and sightseeing, and enjoy the wonderfull Hyde Park. Sit down on a bench and watch the squirrels.||August 8, 2012
DocM1818||40||Great spot to visit during Olympics. Free access to areas with big screens and exciting atmosphere.Easy access all parts of London by Tube.||August 7, 2012
Di B||50||Hyde Park is the social outdoor epicentre of London. When the sun it out it is a beautiful place to visit. In autumn when the leaves change colour, it is a kaleidoscope of orange, red, yellow and brown. The trees, the Italian Gardens, the rose garden, the Serpentine, Kensington Palace - so much to see. A lovely peaceful haven away from the big city traffic and concrete jungle. ||August 7, 2012
Natasha D||40||The view is perfect, great for a bike ride or a stroll with your boyfriend/girlfriend and family! it doesnt feel like youre in London at all, its great!||August 6, 2012
intlwanderlust||50||What can I say? I run, sunbathe, read, picnic and escape in this lovely park. It comforts me year-round and I cannot imagine London without it. For first-time visitors to London I highly recommend a visit here as it truly is a place where locals hang out. It is beautiful any time of year!||August 5, 2012
435GaryM||50||Great park, big enough to really explore and some lovely spots. I certainly recommend walking around the serpentine. The food in the cafes tends to be reasonable. Easy to hire deckchairs in the summer. Great atmosphere in December for the winter wonderland. Just go and explore!||August 5, 2012
JMTravels24||30||We were persuaded to join our daughters in Hyde Park to soak up some of the Olympic Atmosphere but sadly I thought it was a shambles. Crossing the road to Hyde Park reminded me of school as there were attendants helping the public cross - honestly how stupid do they think we are? There are crossings and some of us work in London all year and manage to cross roads without help.Entry to the park may be free but you cannot take food or drink inside so anyone with a family planning to spend the day could spend a fortune. There were the inevitable queues to get in.Once in the Park we were treated to the wood chip covering that has been necessary because of the effects of recent bad weather and crowds on the grass. The park has been given over to the corporate sponsors and looks nothing like a green and tranquil Royal Park. We found a spot and set down to watch the athletics on the larger of the screens...about 30 minutes in the screen was turned off and some unknown to us TV presenter appeared and on came McFly (boy band). I'm sure their fans appreciated this but most people were there to see the Olympics. What the organisers didn't seem to have taken into consideration was that all those who wanted to see the Olympics were then starting to move to the smaller screens -potentially causing a crush situation. The sports fans made their statement when we all stood at one of the smaller screens as the National Anthem was played for one our medal winners.We left via the Green Park exit where a number of stewards with megaphones were shouting at all and sundry 'Get out of the cycle lane' if so much as a toe strayed over the line. Such a pity they weren't remidning cyclists to dismount at the end of the cycle path....On the plus side there are lots of loos and they have running water and there is drinking water provided free.||August 5, 2012
Craig7777777||50||Lovely place, had a weekend in London when the sun was shining, took some cans, a small bite to eat and watched the sun go down. You don't have to buy theExpensive food from the vendors, just nip to tesco express. It is what YOU make of it!!||August 4, 2012
pamsteve091||50||this park has everything, formal gardens, flower gardens, statues, lakes, meadows and cafes. after three visits we still haven't seen everything this park has to offer. the delightful italian gardens then you are in open meadows.this visit we went to the prince albert memorial, wonderful celebration of his live and the love of his wife.then the inadequate memorial to diana. added appeal with it having olympic events in the park and nearby||August 4, 2012
Ellie M||30||convenient, reasonable food and drinks prices...considering it was a closed venue! But I hated the bark (altho realise why its there)||August 1, 2012
Mary P||40||Great fun, especially with the addition of all the Olympic facilities. Special photo opportunities with the Olympic rings.||July 31, 2012
monkelpunkel||40||We visited from Australia during December and absolutely loved our Hyde Park Winter Wonderland experience. Sure, there was no snow, which could have really improved the ambience, but the festival itself was a whole lot of fun. It was packed with people, there were many rides and many stalls selling beautiful Christmas decorations - and so much yummy food from many different cultures. We loved drinking the hot mulled wine, the rich hot chocolates, and tasting all of the foods. We all bought hats (as if we didn't have enough for our trip) - but they were so cute and wouldn't take up THAT much space in our packs.Sure, this is incredibly busy, incredibly crowded and expensive.... but when you come from somewhere that does not have a winter Christmas market, it is something that must be seen and must be done. We visited several times and loved the whole thing (and did I mention the ice skating). Would I visit again? Definitely - next time we travel to London, I would love it to be during winter again, so we can once again visit Winter Wonderland.||July 28, 2012
lalocadr19||30||Beautiful park, good location. Good for all kind of exercise like running, bicycling. People watching and relaxing..||July 27, 2012
backdrifters||40||Ideal for a relaxing stroll at any time of the day. It's a rather large park (if taken in conjunction with Kensington Gardens), so walking the entire space in one go is not particularly recommended.||July 27, 2012
lakshman k||40||i love the boating and was awesome at the olympic torch relay hyde parks coca cola festival there is nothing to dislike about it apart from a bit of litter||July 27, 2012
Mindy278||40||Open spaces with beautiful trees changing with the seasons. Having tea by the Serpentine. Walking by Kensington Palace, Royal Albert Hall, elegant Park Lane, Marble Arch and Bayswater - all in 1 hour and 20 minutes.||July 26, 2012
Snowruby||40||This park was lovely and very well manicured. There were people on the lake paddling boats, people riding horses whilsts others just enjoyed picnics or [tried to] sun bathe on the seats. We didn't find it as specatcular as Central Park in New York but it was just as equally beautiful and had lots to explore.We enjoyed the fountains and the Princess Di monument. I would like to see the ability to hire bikes to be a little more streamlined, it was hard for a tourist to get one.A great place to relax and unwind.||July 25, 2012
Busygirlp||50||We spent a lovely afternoon just sitting on a bench, near The Serpentine, admiring the variety of people walking and riding by. It wasn't hard to imagine that people had been doing just what we were for hundreds of years. ||July 25, 2012

Jamie P||50||Still very green, very beautiful, quiet (for the middle of London). Still I go there time and time again just to sit and think about life away from the very fast paced life that London has||July 19, 2012
Sofiarego||30||Soo green .. Wish I had more time to spend there.N with friends ||July 18, 2012
Greg R||50||Stumbled upon it one cold night while walking through London. Being from the US, I did not realize what it was and had no ideas that it is an annual event. It feels like a fun mix of a carnival, a state fair, a winter-based theme park, and Christmas! It was fantastic with lots of food, attractions and rides for the entire family. Plus the hot mulled wine with brandy was a real kick and a welcomed winter warmer.||July 18, 2012
bryanw314||50||We did a tour and rode our bikes through the parks. I would do Fat tire bike tour again and go for a ride in the park.||July 17, 2012
evyRomsey||50||Maximise your enjoyment of the Park by starting off your walk from Lancaster Gate tube station which brings you past a pretty water feature (we watched a nest of moorhens here last summer), riders often to be seen exercising their horses around the perimeter of the Park, continue along the Serpentine (with its swimming area and boating lake), stopping off at The Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, passing several cafes, and onto Speakers Corner; from here you can access Marble Arch and Oxford Street with its famous shops.||July 17, 2012
R_Mill11||50||I love Hyde park. Its massive, well kept. Its a wonderful place for takign the kids or going cycling or running. We go running here and have marked out a 3 mile and 6 mile route! You can go for a stroll or be more active. The boating pond is good. Or you could choose to do nothign at all. its all good fun.||July 17, 2012
Sarah H||40||Nice place for a walk, large and a variety of things to do. Wouldn't recommend eating or drinking here - bring your own picnic.||July 17, 2012
Linda G||50||Concert great but treated like cattle by security staff at the end.||July 16, 2012

The_Dootch||50||Been to hyde park for hard rock calling a number of times. Seen some of my favourite gigs ever here. Sound is amazing, atmosphere is quality too. Food is overpirced but the norm at these sort of things, and who really eats here anyway-not me! I try and make it here as much as possible, as it's never too expensive and you get to see some awesome acts. I've seen Blur, Paul Weller, Arcade Fire and Kings of Leon to name just a few||July 16, 2012
Faltime||50||Go for a walk in the park.. lots of nice things to see.. don't eat there it's expensive...||July 15, 2012
Christifemus||50||Its such an amazing place. Tousends of people relaxing, jogging, playing games, sleeping, kissing, dancing, reading books, poetry, walking, organizing amazing events...You can expect everything from that place and its always something new. Just take a blanket and go, lay down, watch, feel it:) Its huge so you will find your and only yours secret place:)||July 15, 2012
Brewer4||50||Formerly hunting grounds, in the 1500s, this open park of some 44 acres has something for anyone to enjoy, from open acres of green grass, perfect for a pick up game of your favorite sport, or a picnic, or just take a snooze! There are lakes, flower gardens, even a place for a light meal. speakr's corner was interesting, ( near Oxforde street end of the park), as we happened to be there the day a speaker took this soup box.at the far end of Hyde Park is Kensington Palace as well as the embassys from many countries. Enjoyable place to spend time!||July 12, 2012
julie g||40||You can go for horse rides, cycles rides (get a Boris Bike) as well as run and jog here. There is easy access from Hyde Park Corner tube station. Beware the cafes here are expensive. ||July 10, 2012
Mrs E||50||We went to Hyde Park on our first day in London and walked around for a few hours. Very nice park with plenty of things to do from feeding the birds, to paddle boating or just sitting on the grass and enjoying the day!||July 9, 2012
VillaBatalha||50||i spent such a great time with friends there. just relax and enjoy the view||July 9, 2012
Amy G||40||Take some time to walk around this park and other areas of the city. Don't just see "the touristy" sites!||July 9, 2012
FRIEDA K||40||We went to Hyde Park midday on a Sunday to experience the Speaker's Corner. It is a loud and fascinating look at democracy in action. There are scattered groups of people listening and interacting on a variety of topics. You can stroll around and see what interests you. Usual topics seem to be politics and religion. If you come in the middle of someone's talk/speech/tirade, it might take awhile to find out what their point is. Sometimes it is very serious and impassioned, and sometimes it is very humorous. Worth a look. You don't see it quite like this in other cities.||July 5, 2012
Tracy W||50||fantastic place to go.children loved it here.they just play & have fun||July 4, 2012
Chubb||40||We had a great day there today.it gave the kids a wonderful opportunity to just run and playing the big open fields. We started out at the Royal Albert Memorial which is just stunning and walked along all the paths down to the Italian Gardens based off of Victoria and.Albert's. It was really lovely. The best part for the kids was the playground up the hill from there. They loved it!||July 4, 2012
Avery R||40||A nice getaway from the busy (and sometimes overwhelming) central London. Very pleasant and calm. It also had free clean bathrooms which was a nice surprise! We walked around during the early morning before a long day which was a very nice, fresh start to our day.||July 3, 2012
GeorginaK450||40||Good place to escape to for a nice picnic. I often go for an evening stole through Hyde park and it never fails to relax me||July 3, 2012
MoeLoveheart||50||Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are a slice of heaven in the midst of London. The extensive grounds provide places for walking, cycling, horse riding, exercising, reading a book or just doing nothing. The grounds are ever so green and there is always something interesting to see and do. Visiting these gardens are a must for everyone coming to London.||July 1, 2012
hydeparkgirl2||50||If in Hyde Park, I advise to rent a Barclay's bike. Very inexpensive, 1 Euro for 24 hours. There is so much to see and on a bike, you can experience more and do it London style! Cheers!||July 1, 2012
ana_kecik||50||the best place for everyone...cool, calm, peace, beautiful,...the best place to hang in london.no matter how old are u, this is the best place ever. the garden is to big and the best way to walk around is by using bicycle.||July 1, 2012
nihalcag||50||Fantastic green area in the heart of London! It is great for walking, bycle, picnic,reading,sleeping:) You have to spare some free time in Hyde Park. I wish it here, I would go every weekend. It is so big and impossible to finish it in one day. You really have very long free time to get pleasure. ||June 30, 2012
Robyn H||50||A bicycle ride through Hyde Park was a totally enjoyable, refreshing experience in central London. What an oasis in the middle of a busy city! Beautiful trees, lovely, well maintained gardens, and lots of birds...........even saw some very friendly squirrels. My only disappointment was the Lady Diana Memorial Fountain ...... what a poor attempt at a Memorial for someone so well loved. A fountain............is it really a fountain?? Anyway, we hired the bikes at a very reasonable price as our time was limited which was a great way to see the Park. We would like to spend more time here, walking and maybe hiring a boat, on our next visit to London. Highly recommend visitors to London spending time in this wonderful Park. Hyde Park is a real treasure.||June 29, 2012
LP303||50||Lovely park to walk, run, cycle or picnic in. Very large with a variety of attractions: Boats for hire, swimming, cafes, cycling, picnics, chair rental by the ponds .... the list goes on and on.Contains several beautiful memorials: Fountain in memory of Princess Diana, Holocaust Memorial ....this is worth an afternoon's visit if you have the time & want to relax.The gardens are quite lovely (near Buckingham Palace) and it can be enjoyed by all ages.||June 28, 2012
DCLDad||50||We liked the proximity to Kensington Palace and Gardens, Marble Arch and Oxford St.||June 28, 2012
AudreyLA||50||Hyde Park gets better and better. It has lakes and gardens, areas that are manicured and areas left wild. Kensington Palace is there and a nice place to visit. There are occasional summer concerts there. The Serpentine was closed while preparing a Yoko Ono exhibition, but it had the outdoor installation, which was such fun! The restaurant on the lake has good food and is a good place to grab a snack and watch the people (or the ducks, swans and geese). I take a very early morning walk, and always felt perfectly safe in the park. With so many paths, you can choose a different route every day, and go as many miles as you like. ||June 27, 2012
macasam||50||Stopped of for a picnic, watched some joggers, had a great afternoon.||June 27, 2012

jennykatja||50||The biggest park i've been to. You can do so much from picnics to just relaxing. There is also a restaurant by a lake side which is a must go for couples.||June 24, 2012
Joanna C||50||Great park to spend a day/half a day/an hour in! Easy to get to, really nice cafe and pond in the middle.||June 24, 2012
PaulaF343||50||Hyde park is beautiful. My husband and I spent hours walking, sitting etc. There are beautiful statues, gardens, cafes and bridges. You can walk to Kensington palace at one end of the park as well. We really enjoyed this part of London.||June 23, 2012
Elshamir||50||Make sure bring your running shoes in london. Must try running at the hyde park. Its a lifetime experience||June 20, 2012
DavoCheshire||40||First of all, it's free to get in! This a huge park and all of humankind is here, from tourists (a-plenty) to office workers eating their lunch. Sit on a bench and watch the roller-skaters, or hire a pedalo. Visit the Diana memorial garden, get an ice-cream and lie on the grass. Great!||June 20, 2012
Dawn G||50||One of our most beautiful parks, with something for everyone. Have tea by the lake, or stroll along with friends. On a good day bring a picnic and enjoy sitting on the grass and watching the world go by!||June 20, 2012
J4mie||50||Ran 26,8km/2,5hours in Hyde Park, such an nice place. I wanted to stay for a picknick - maybe next time :)||June 20, 2012
RieJ||20||The park is huge. parts of the park is closed, we thought it might be because of the olympics. we wanted to rent a bike to get around the park, but it did not work, neither for any of the other 10 tourists wanting to do the same.||June 18, 2012
MASWScreenwriter||40||Hyde Park (and, to the west, Kensington Gardens) is the largest park in central London. It is well kept and diverse, and views over the Serpentine provide added interest. It is probably best for walkers - for example if you start in the very north west (in Bayswater) you can walk through Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, into Green Park and then into St James's park, completing your walk by Horseguards and the back of 10 Downing Street, virtually all within the parks themselves. Probably best enjoyed in summer but plenty of seasonal effects at other times of year.||June 18, 2012
Jennifer R||50||Loved it! Great for walks or runs. Nice memorials to check out and lots of people enjoying the park as well||June 17, 2012
jlt5||50||Just having a quiet moment in the heart of London is priceless.And if you like squirrels, you can see a lot of them, not frightened by people.||June 17, 2012
lolamar66||50||This is a beautiful park for a stroll, people watching or picnic. We enjoyed our view of the park from the Grovner House Hotel. If your in London you have to take a walk through this park.||June 16, 2012
Arvind S||40||A good place for morning jog, photography, spot paining, sports, recreation and what not. It is very well maintained and you can find a lot of hobbyists, enthusiasts and even social activists taking part in it. It provides an excellent gateway from the otherwise busy life in London.It is better to take a map of Hyde Park and explore it walking. Not something that you would like to touch and go, but certainly a place where you would like to be at leisure.Multiple attractions, diversity of people and serpentine lakes add much glamour to it. I would recommend to walk around the periphery first and then explore from inside. There is a lot to explore and it was my favourite place to spend time.There is no entry fee, so you can enter at will and enjoy the beauty.||June 16, 2012
Catarina G||50||You can really get lost in the park surrended by trees, birds and swans. One of my favourite place to escape to on weekends and summer days. Usually filled with family, joggers and the odd celebrities, this is the place to relax, picnic and get away from the hustle and buzzle of the close by oxford circus madness||June 15, 2012
BlackrodWeaver||40||We hit it on a lovely day, have a drink at the speakers corner cafe the explore a vast park with so much to see||June 14, 2012
HelenaHD||50||What a great day to spend the afternoon, walk around the lake watch the sun appear and disappear, visit the serpentine gallery which has evolving exhibitions that are amazing. Then after you are done walking visit the Serpentine bar inside the park, sit on deck chairs outside with the lake view and indulge in the English tradition of drinking a jug of Pims.....Classic British day||June 14, 2012
BrianFLondon||50||Nice place just to get away from the busy streets. I watched The Kings Of Leon here and it was fantastic.||June 13, 2012
AlexP260||30||There is always something going on here apart from the visitors. great place to walk around and escape from the people||June 13, 2012
Y1763OAalanl||40||Visited Hyde park as our hotel was right opposite Marble arch what a place from speakers corner "worth a visit on Sunday morning" where you can see the loons on thiere soap boxes through to the boating lake really is a fab place and in the right weather could occupy a whole day.||June 11, 2012
AdamPierson||40||What a great park! There is so much to see, some great places to sit and take it all in and it’s completely free! An oasis of calm in the middle of London!||June 11, 2012

starfruitsalad||50||Such a great place to go for a run in the centre of London. Also crazy how quickly you get from Lancaster Gate to Kensington by walking through the park. Highly recommendable!||June 10, 2012
Richard A||40||One of the great city parks in the world. A lake where you can hire a boat or sit at the cafe and watch the wildfowl. There are also stables to hire a horse to ride along the famous Rotton Row, you may just trott past royalty. Close to Knightsbridge, Park Lane and Oxford Street. There are a number of shows in the park throughout the year.||June 10, 2012
Helen M||50||If you love walking, you will love Hyde park, it's an amazing park. The flower beds are fabulous, the huge trees so shady and leafy, you can walk for miles & not notice the distance because theres so much to see and lovely cafes to rest in. Great evening out as well for a run or a stroll.||June 10, 2012
MariaEconomides||50||It's the place I go running every time I visit London. Also a great place for a picnic or dog-walking. The park's attraction, however, are the numerous squirrels, so cute little creatures!!!||June 10, 2012
saqawm||40||we started from lancaster gate underground, followed the river/lake around to mayfair area. Nice and relaxing day out. Saw some swans, ducks etc.||June 8, 2012

Squiffy1957||50||We went here with family and friends for the christmas wonderland and we weren't dissapointed with plenty for everyone to do and everything was well organised.

niraM83||50||Very clean nice and quiet park. I was amazed by the ducks and squirrels that were eating from hand and the white swans. It was very green and tidy in May !||June 3, 2012
lin w||50||Nice and beautiful. best for a walk,or cylce or a picnic!!||June 3, 2012
Jessica_nz2||50||We spent a good part of the day here. squirrels were out early and very tame,saw them taking food out tof a persons hand. The horses that you could hire to go around the entire park were in very good condition and were a joy to watch. Pet cemetery was a bit of a let down, I realised that you couldn't go in it, but I thought that the hedges could of been cut a bit so people could admire it from beyond the gate. Albert memorial was well worth a visit.||May 31, 2012
hemligt||30||Nice for a walk and relax. Not much to see exept gooses and sqirrels :)||May 30, 2012
kimiha01||50||Loved Hyde Park, it was a lovely sunny warm day. We walked everywhere, and stopped at Speaker's Corner. We listened to some really fascinating people, some were intelligent, some belligerant, some just having fun. Totally worth it to go, we had the best time.||May 28, 2012

Wendy H||40||We are a pair of middle aged unfities but we managed very well to hire a couple of Boris Bikes and enjoyed a tootle in the park, a toot toot of buses (scary) along Piccadilly then deposited easily in theatre land. Just take care to find a rental site where enough bikes are green to go! Otherwise great fun well done London.||May 24, 2012
debholmes23||50||I love Hyde Park and its calm green existence in the hub of the City just a few yards in places from very busy roads, it is a peaceful oasis and well worth a visit f only to walk through on your journey elsewhere.||May 19, 2012
TravelFarEnough||50||London in April is generally wet. But what breaks up the bleakness is the bursting colour in Hyde Park. I've visited this park each time I've visited London and always find something new. Hours could be spent here. Grab your map, get your bearings, then put the map away and just wander the park. Enjoy it all that is around you. Have picnic lunch but watch the wildlife. I had a squirrel run up my leg for my sandwich. The serpentine is really beautiful at sunset but be aware of park closing times. This is a stunner in the middle of a bustling city, and well worth having on your list with the other 'must sees'||May 17, 2012
lynniemac13||50||loved it all. The horses, the roller skaters, the joggers and dog walkers. Wonderful to see bikes for hire and dedicated cycle paths. Don't miss looking for the green parrot flocks either. But watch out for the greedy geese! ||May 16, 2012
Michael R||40||Some really great concerts in the park sometimes, and hotels near Queensway are convenient.||May 16, 2012
jennydunstan||50||London is indeed fortunate in having such wonderful parks, like St James' Park, Hyde Park; and further afield Hampstead Heath and Kew Gardens.Hyde Park is huge and just begs to be explored. It is a great place for long walks or bike rides, or just to sit by the Serpentine and watch the ducks. If you are in London and need to get away from the shops and museums - spend a few hours here.||May 13, 2012
lieblingster||40||To relex after shopping,Museums and work there is nothing like taking a walk in Hyde Park . Take an hour or 2 at least for a stroll in the park.||May 11, 2012
Shawn B||50||This park can be a saviour for those with smaller children. The place is huge and the kids can get out and run. There are some paddle boats that are fun to take out and feeding the birds is always a hit. On the north side there is a good playground.||May 11, 2012
Brooke D||50||Walking through these lovely, huge parks was a true delight. They are maintained with impeccably. The grass was longer in some places, you could walk anywhere on it - no "keep off the grass" signs anywhere. It was so refreshing. We walked for 2 hours till our feet could take no more.||May 10, 2012
rangerdan96||50||This park is beautiful to walk around in and people watch. Even better than people watching here is the dog watching. Dogs everywhere of all shapes and sizes playing together. Hours of entertainment.||May 9, 2012
simonpowered||40||Historical, beautiful park. A great way to spend the afternoon, with a nice cafe for lunch, or tea or coffee. If you have seen many of London's great sights, this is a great place to go. But see other things first.||May 9, 2012
Dibbla51||50||Beautifful cafe overlooking the Lido. Lovely Park and clean, shame about the weather though. the Police 'station has lovely front garden too. ||May 6, 2012
Leo_in_London||50||A lovely escape from the hustle of London's streets and wonderfully located close to some of the most central areas. Grab a Boris bike and Cycle around or get a great pizza from the serpentine restaurant on the knightsbridge side||May 4, 2012
missharrop||40||Speakers corner in Hyde Park is just by the Marble Arch train station. It's worth a visit and was quite amuzing to see several people standing on their soap boxes having a monologue about religion, policis, economics or whatever they felt like discussing. The rest of the park is huge and is a great walk. There were people horseback riding and rollerblading as well!||May 2, 2012
Chris H||40||Living in London can get pretty cramped. There isn't a lot of room to go around. This is where London's many parks come in, and this is definitely a great one. It's massive. You can wander into some places and feel like you are out in the English country side. A few years back, we stayed in a holiday rental flat a stones throw from the park. We spent many days there, with our young son. It was a great place for him to play and run and play with sticks and rocks, watch ducks and geese, see people running and biking. He loved playing at the Diana Memorial Park, and there was a carousel set up near Kensington Palace that he just couldn't stop watching. My best experience there was Hard Rock Calling a few years ago. The park made an amazing music festival venue, and plays host to a number of them throughout the year. There was plenty of room, it felt like a festival out in the countryside, and the event was well organized. Overall, yes, Hyde Park is a great place to go and visit in London. .||May 2, 2012
GILL02091984||40||My boyfriend, family and i visited Hyde Park after Christmas when the Winter Wonderland was on. Loved it. Lots of little Christmas stalls and fun fair rides. There was an ice skating rink in the middle. Was very christmassy and would recommend. Best at night when all the lights are up.||May 2, 2012
Rasmus G||40||So nice a space in the center, pure relax time after shopping||May 2, 2012
NavinNorwich4||40||Everyone knows Hyde Park very well, with its serpentine, lido and italianate fountains. But I wanted to tell you that it is a very good destination for anyone who wants to learn / re-start cycling as I did just yesterday. You can get the 'Boris Bike' and go around the park or further away if you are feeling brave. There are at least 2 cycle docks, use your credit card and cycle away. One thing to remember is that if you use the temporaray pass to unlock your cycle the number pads on the docks do not always work. I had to try and get 4 temporary passes at use them at 2 different docks, but let that not deter you as it will most likely work in the end and the cycling is really lovely and worth the effort. Good fun and good for your heart and healt too. Get up and go...but beware the english weather choose a nice sunny day and you will never forget the experience.||May 1, 2012
unclepious||50||Hyde Park has a special place in the heart of every Londoner. Just to the east of Kensington Gardens, this vast park has trees, open spaces, playgrounds, bridle paths and even a lake (the Serpentine) in which you can paddle if you so desire. Yes, there are dinky little pedalos for hire though I've never risked it. There's so much space that even in the height of summer you can find somewhere agreeably far enough away from other human beings under the shadow of a tree. There are cafes-all of which are very good though occasionally crowded-and some fascinating historical sites (Kensington Gardens, Apsley House) for those of a historical disposition. Don't miss it. Seeing the park through the starboard window of your 747 or A300 on one of your many circuits before landing at Heathrow is no substitute for visiting, so now there's no excuse...||April 30, 2012
jallen4049||50||Hyde Park is an oasis and well worth fighting the traffic to get into it. It is big enough to have quite different areas within it, so wherever you wander you will find something nice. ||April 29, 2012
RikuSora||40||Very well held park, well worth the visit. Great for anyone who wants to take a few minutes away from shopping and busy attractions. Close to kensington palace. We enjoyed our visit alot! Recommended.||April 27, 2012
499joannew||40||What a lovely place to visit, wide open spaces, impressive Italian fountains and lots of maps and routes to follow. Worth taking time to go and see it.||April 27, 2012
annymc||50||This park is full of activity, cycles, boats, cafes, restaurants, bars and most of all beautiful trees and shrub and flowers. I simply love this park and try to visit any time I am in England.||April 26, 2012
Marcel34||50||A very pleasant stroll around Hyde Park is a must when in London, so many different areas to see, chipmunks to feed, dogs running happily without leads and so well behaved, cyclists, flowers cafes ponds birds,deck chairs to sit and enjoy the view, the list is endless, one doesn't feel that the bustling city of london is just outside the gates. If you are able it would be a wonderful spot to pack a picninc lunch and there is also a really lovely play area for children.||April 21, 2012
Jetsetta555||30||Does what it says on the in, it is a park ! take a picnic and a blanket as the eateries both in the park and in nearby Oxford St are a rip off.||April 21, 2012
George A||50||Enjoyed a wonderful walk on a Spring morning from Mable Arch to Hyde Park corner via a circumnavigation of the Serpentine. Plenty going on from the fitness training groups to children enjoying themselves in the play area, and the Blues and Royals in full Regalia trotting along Rotten Row. If you like wildlife then there is plenty to see - even a swan on it's nest near the Lido. What we like is the variation in Scenery from open Parkland through to the Dell below the Serpentine and the more formal gardens towards Hyde Park Corner. We were impressed by the number of TFL bike stations now located around the park and will be tempted to try out this excellent way of getting around the whole area at a later date. Since we last visited some years back there are many more little 'huts' selling coffee but we headed to 'The Lido' and were amazed to find the price reasonable and the coffee good!||April 20, 2012
AnnaDespotidi||50||I could live in this park! Just lie down in the grass, read your book, drink your coffee and enjoy relaxing times… Trees, flowers… amazing!||April 20, 2012
LONDONCABDRIVER||40||In December the winter Wonderland starts, but on Christmas day the peter pan cup is held - its a swimming race!. But you have the baracks, serpentine, Diana memorial, speakes corner.||April 18, 2012
123Familyman||50||Lovely huge park, Princes Diana Memorial, Prince Albert Memorial.||April 16, 2012
Bib74||40||We went as a family and enjoyed the sun while walking around the park, the kids hired bikes and went all around the park , which is safe and very secure.Also there was horseback riding for the interested, and lots of stops to enjoy the flowers, the lake, the squirrels , a children playground and so on.Hyde park is not a sightseeing place , more likely a relaxing day in the sun!||April 16, 2012
lothloria||50||The park is well worth a visit. It is really huge, so we didn't see all of it, but we took a stroll through it from Lancaster Gate to Knightsbridge and went along the Serpentine (the water within the park). We hade lovely weather, which made the walk really pleasant. There are a lot of things to do in the park, we saw people riding and even swimming. There are a lot of birds near the water, and also information and pictures of them so that you can learn about the birdlife. The trees were so beautiful and the gardens had just started to bloom, wonferful park to visit in the springtime!Tip: Don't forget to bring your best walking shoes, because, as I wrote earlier, this is a huge park!SummaryPositive things:- Gardens really taken care of- Clean- Several places to eat- Good information (signposts and information about the local wildlife)- Public toilets- No charge- A lot of activitiesNegative things:- Some people are walking their dogs without a leash, which might be scary if you are afraid of dogs- Might be crowded during days with sunny weather- Cars are allowed to drive in the park (only in the outskirts, but it still ruins a bit of the impression)||April 13, 2012
holidayhappydays||30||Hyde Park isn't going any where if you visit London more than once so don't rush however it is a must see and walk through but don't expect anything on the scale of Central Park!||April 12, 2012
kehAustralia||30||We saw parts of hyde park on our trip to London and although it is a nice park, I woudn't say that it is anything overly special. If you are in the area it is worth a wander, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again. ||April 12, 2012
cjsweetcandy||40||It's very pretty in the Autumn (Fall) with all the colored leaves. Nice clean & safe park||April 10, 2012

It's a long but worthwhile walk...trust me!||April 10, 2012

LKUB||40||Lovely to walk arround in. A great big park, in the center of London, but it is quiet, green and lovely! Is fantastic in the summer time!||April 7, 2012
Donto1||50||While visiting London in late March of this year, a friend and I stayed at the Lancaster London Hotel across the street from Hyde Park at Lancaster Gate. On our first morning we decided to walk through the park to Buckingham Palace and on to Westminster Abbey. It was a beautiful morning and we found the walk through the park to be a wonderful start to our day! Although we only saw a small portion of this vast park, we enjoyed the beautiful trees and flowers as well as the birds and squirrels, etc. If we had had more days to spend in London we difinitely would have explored more of the park and hope to do so on a future visit. ||April 7, 2012
CRVT123||50||I walk through the park almost every day; it's big enough so that when you are in the middle you forget you are in a city. ||April 4, 2012
V1ck1||50||Really enjoyed the winter wonderland at Hyde Park, the rides were a little expensive but the atomosphere and range of places to eat and drink was excellent and the toilet facilities were impressive. A little expensive but worth every penny.||April 3, 2012
paulw1066||50||We strolled up from the south end to Marble Arch on a Sunday. It was just nice - a lovely green space in the middle of London. Not much going on. A couple of ranters in Speakers Corner, a few horses, runners, cafe was open, just nice. London is so lucky to have it and all the other parks.||April 3, 2012
tony t||30||Ok very clean and pleasent, enjoyable to run or jog, or even just a walk.||April 3, 2012
Notafusspot||50||Than to stroll or bike ride or horse ride for that matter around Hyde park. A book , a sandwich , a coffee fresh air and as long as you don't mind squirrels, plenty of them. Take time out to chill out here. Lovely and so central.||April 2, 2012
Louise G||50||Awesome park, absolutely huge. Great for the kids, squirrels tearing around everywhere. Families out walking, even in the winter. Good wide paths, or lots of grass to run around on. Pleanty of room for everyone. Lots of statues etc to see, or just enjoy the fresh air.||April 2, 2012

lil_blenky||50||You could dedicate the best part of a day to this beautiful park. When the weather is fine - you will feel like you are in heaven!So many things to see and do within Hyde Park - take a boat on the Serpentine, picnic on its expanse of lush grass, visit Speakers' Corner and statues aplenty, including a stunning gold one commisioned by Queen Victoria for her late husband Albert at the south of the park - which looks out onto the Royal Albert Hall. If you are staying close to Notting Hill this is a perfect cut through to Chelsea/Knightsbridge. Breaks the walk up :o)||March 28, 2012
william1225||50||the vastness of the whole area, very popular with all ages.I saw a concert in Hyde Park on a lovely summers days and will always remember the atmosphere.||March 28, 2012

TAMember04092012||50||I know this big central London park well and Kensington Palace with it's Gardens, where both Queen Victoria grew up and Princess Diana lived, is at the west end. I like Hyde Park's sheer size, variety and the Rose Garden most. As it's BiG a (hire) bicycle is the best way to get about and to select a place to picnic, or grab a bite to eat. London has the so-called municipal 'Boris Bikes' so you may want to rent one for a few hours and deposit it wherever you find yourself upon completion. Hyde Park' is good for all ages, extremely safe and a relaxing way to absorb the local flavour and locale.||March 23, 2012
Doris168||50||The whole park is well kept and strolling through it in spring is such a pleasure. There are lots of benches around for resting and flower admiring!||March 20, 2012

Mafisen||50||Hyde Park is a perfect place to spend a day when in London, especially if you have kids who have to blow off some steam.The park is huge so no risk of it being crowded although there is a lot of people there on any given day.At the norhteast end is Speaker´s Corner, where you can listen to John Doe giving his views on every subject imaginable. Feel free to join in and argue with the speaker. This takes place on Sundays.In the Serpentine, you can both swim at the Lido and take a boat trip.We love walking through the park on a sunny day. Bring some food and have a lovely picnic in the sun, or in the shade of a big tree.In the winter, there is, or was a few years ago at least, the Winter Wonderland fun fair, with rides, a skating rink etc. etc.Cross over into the adjoining Kensington Gardens and visit Princess Diana´s Memorial Playground, a place our kids love to visit. It features a pirate ship and a water area, where children can go wild.||March 16, 2012

breadsauce||50||What an amazing place.. the whole thing was so well organised.. luckily I had booked tickets to the Observation Wheel in advance so we didn't have to queue.. Although entry is free the attractions aren't and it's well worth booking in advance .The queue for entrance was overwhelming!!! The organisers kept the amount of people in the park to a comfortable level. The rides averaged £4 each (not too expensive for London) there were plenty of food and drink stalls available without waiting to be served. It was beautiful, the lights the stalls the whole atmosphere was truly Wonderful. Everything was so well organised, the wheel, the skating the funfair... absolutely brilliant!! Well done !!!||February 20, 2012

Esty666||50||This is probably one of the best known parks worldwide - ona par with, say, Central Park. You couold indeed spend a whole day in there wihtout running out of things to do or getting bored - providede you get clement weather. Famous also for its Speaker Corner, where anybody can get on soapbox and enjoy total freedom of speech with impunity - well, or almost, I guess - the Serpentine with boats on it, the endless shady lanes, the benches to sit down on, specific gardens insuide the park, a gallery etc. There are even horseback riders, as well as bike riders of course, people on rollerblades and skateboards ... visitors to londin should not leave without having seen Hyde Park.||February 19, 2012
Howard T||40||Go early in the morning to see the Horse Guards working out.||February 18, 2012
FoxyLady1972||50||Another oasis of peace in a busy city. Amazing how many novels its mentioned in too.||February 18, 2012

fillyk||40||I always enjoy spending a bit of time in Hyde Park when I'm in London. Sometimes it's just a stroll through, sometimes a picnic. Once I fulfilled a lifetime ambitiion to ride up Rotten Row and booked a ride with local stables - glad I did it, but maybe just failed to live up to expectations slight. On a horsey note you may be lucky enough to see the Household cavalry out on exercise - a unique sight in any capital city!All in all, the park is always worth calling into. ||February 17, 2012

lwaxanna||40||London is full of parks and this is the biggest. It joins on, interrupted only by Hyde Park Corner Roundabout, to Green Park and St James's park to the East and Kensington Gardens to the West. It is largely a vast grassy area with some formal planting. Rotten Row, the horse riding track, circumnavigates it. Horses can be hired locally - for a price.||February 16, 2012
krysskass||50||Loved the location, the scale and most of all the concept and reality of 'Speakers' Corner'!||February 16, 2012

Rigby79||50||I regularly jog in Hyde Park but if you've got some time it's great to have a wonder around the serpantine or sit out on the grass. If it gets warm enough go for a swim in the serpanine Lido. Well worth it. Rowing boats and peddalos are pricey though.||February 14, 2012
JacGalway||50||Wonderful park for all ages. It is so big you could get lost in it. Great for relaxing or just going for a stroll.||February 14, 2012
Ann H||40||So many different things at different times of the year. We went during the Christmas Bavarian Market, and had alovely time||February 13, 2012
cherie0||50||A perfect choice for a family day out, especially in the summer. We loved ambling around Hyde Park, and particularly enjoyed hiring the pedaloes on the lake, expensive, but worth it, and just ideal with kids after days of shopping and trekking about, they can run and play. It is a lovely day out.||February 13, 2012
mina d||50||a great walk from the noise and bustle of life, take ten to just visit and enjoy||February 13, 2012

Burak D||50||If you go to London, definitely visit Hyde Park for a rest. Or buy some things to eat from the restaurants on Oxford Street and have a great lunch on the green fields of Hyde Park...||February 13, 2012
217tabathaj||30||Both times Ive been to London there was lots of construction. I barely broke out the camera. If you are looking for a nice park or garden to take in skip this and go to St. James park instead.||February 12, 2012
RunawayVieve||40||Always a great place to escape the ratrace of London city streets. I typically cycle through here - great any time of the year.||February 11, 2012
Rocket_man_in_ESA||50||Hyde Park is huge. It is just a wonderful place to pass a Sunday morning walking. If you are lucky, there will be a band concert or you will see the horses being exercised. Take a pedalo on the Serpentine and scoot around for a happy half hour, almost unable to remember that you are in the middle of one of the world's biggest cities. Sit at the bar alongside the lake and enjoy a drink watching the world pass by, or just pick a bench and feed the squirrels.||February 11, 2012
Tori L||50||Love hyde Park! amazing walk! Deck chairs out in the summer. Lovely atmosphere!||February 10, 2012
SSSputnik||50||Ok. It had snowed the night before, but this is a lovely, historical park, with some beautiful monuments and features. Well worth a look if you are visiting. The Science And Natural History museums are easy walking distance away. Worth a visit after soaking up wisdom.||February 9, 2012
Sasaangelica||50||Though it was freezing we loved strolling though the park. However I'm sure if the weather was warmer I'd have loved to spend the whole day there.||February 8, 2012
Ravaa||50||Its a very good theme park... Peaceful and green.. Love to spend time at the park. ||February 8, 2012
lorna2011||40||Sometimes on a day out in London we need a break for the busy streets and head to Hyde Park, theres a few sandwich shops on the side streets so we get some lunch and go to the park to eat it. It beats a McDonalds or kfc and is cheaper than eating in one of the pricier cafes. ||February 7, 2012
pilkie||50||On a wintry weekend in February there is so much to see. Squirrels, so many different kinds of birds including water birds and cockatoos, people roller blading, riding horses, jogging and walking. Places to get food and drink and sit and so much green space. Excellent!||February 6, 2012

EllenChr||40||If you want to escape the city's hustle and bustle - take a stroll through Hyde Park. It's wonderful and varied. In summer time it is wonderful for a pick-nick - but also for a leasurely stroll. If the weather is good, it's perfect to walk through it on your way to or from Kensington Palace or the Museums on the south side.||February 2, 2012
FOXYSKI||50||Lots of different areas to hang out, particularly good when the Christmas events are on but great for summer pop concerts such as Wireless too.||February 1, 2012

Theresa M||40||Beautiful park at the heart of British life; popular concert venue in summer. Go boating on the Serpentine, or have a swim, if you're brave enough!||January 31, 2012
Ravell S||50||I have just ambled through this enormous green space in the heart of London. It's amazing how much is going on but personally I just like to switch off, stroll by the Princess Diana Memorial, look in the gallery and pop out in South Kensington. I felt just great.||January 31, 2012
Malta2009||40||Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park.It starts on the 18 November a beautiful fair with lots of rides for adults, teens and even children.There was also many stalls selling christmas decorations and food.There was also an ice skating ring.

FeiFairuz||50||its a big wide open space for recreational activities. My kids love to run at this park even in winter. a lot of tame pigeon and so does squirel. We also walk across the park from Queensway road (where we are stayed) to the buckingham palace. Relaxing and calming||January 30, 2012

Globetrottergirls||50||Hyde Park is London's green oasis - when you're in the middle of the park, you have no idea that you're actually in a buzzing 7-million metropolis! Great for picnics, rollerskating, jogging, cycling or horse back riding.||January 28, 2012
KS_Edge||50||Love this park have spent many happy hours walking our dogs here. Clean and safe with plenty of little cafes dotted around.||January 28, 2012

dgconroy||50||When we were visiting London, it was late November so Winterwonderland was on in the park! They have loads of Christmas market stall's with loads of different foods!!... A huge ice rink, and music is playing also! If you want to ice skate make sure and book it before hand as its very busy. Some lovely pubs along the way, and a great atmosphere overall! From the decorations to the smell of mulled wine, it had a lovely chrstmas feel to it!!||January 25, 2012
EssexWanderer||40||Massive Park - full of grass and trees and that kind of thing. Also a big rowing lake called the Serpentine - where mad people swim on Christmas Day in the freezing cold. Horses on Rotten Row it is still a place to show off and be seen, just like the 'olden days'. Sadly though, Speakers Corner should probably be renamed Squeakers Corner these days!!||January 18, 2012
JPea8||50||Its difficult to believe this lushious green park can be found in the centre of our capital - lovely for a walk around.||January 18, 2012
Luke242||40||Hyde Park, simply brilliant! Great Park, large, many things to do, free gallery (the Serpentine) and quite pleasant to me!If there is any negatives though, I would say sometimes it can be too busy with people running and it is like being in the middle of the road, yelling at me to be out of the way, which was a bit off putting! Also much construction/engineering works taking place near Kensington Palace is quite depressing, so may not re-open until late spring 2012 due to the olympics, I have heard.Recommended.||January 14, 2012
paulwilkinson||30||Basically a german christmas market on steroids. A huge number of rides, shops, stalls and food and drink outlets.Food was the usual overpriced stuff, but the beer was more reasonably priced than I was expecting.There was a great selection of rides including an impressive rollercoaster and a big tower although they were quite expensive per go. All the rides required tokens which could be bought in lots of places and were a pound each.The ice rink was built around the bandstand and was huge. Live music was provided for about half of the session and the band were pretty good. Skates were the usual uncomfortable plastic ones. Plenty of help and support from the ice marshalls for those who were less confident on the ice.||January 13, 2012
kmrkjr||40||Loads of stalls with a wonderful variety of goods on sale, and tasty food on offer. Pretty crowded as this time of year which is to be expected! Bus links very convenient!||January 13, 2012
Evan P||30||"Winter Wonderland", the German Christmas event in Hyde Park was amusing. It's essentially a German-themed carniival on steroids. There are thrill rides and "fun houses"; some very sophisticated considering the event is only for a few weeks before and just after Christmas. We thought the cost of rides a bit pricy. There's a wide variety of beer, sausages and other typical German food. The only disappointment was the merchandise being sold. For the most part, it was souvenir shop trinkets. Few, if any, originated in Germany. All things considered, it's worth a visit||January 12, 2012
KevHurst||50||One of the best parks in the whole of London. Great to chill out on a summer's day. ||January 11, 2012
Jo-Mortimer25||40||One of the more stately of the London parks, who would believe you were in the middle of a huge city?||January 10, 2012
Shey07||30||I am a Londoner and I really do not understand what all the fuss is about Hyde Park. I always tell people who are visiting to check our Regents Park instead, its much nicer.||January 10, 2012
tommyharris||50||A nice place to take a walk, picnic, or just people watch.||January 8, 2012
Dibbla51||50||Wow. What a fantastic day. I have been to German Christmas Markets but this was the best of all. The food and drink were abundant. Very well organised. Had something for everyone. Loved the roundabout with a bar in the middle. The marquee was fantatsic, it was heated, sit down, restaurant and a live band. Just brilliant. We will be going again next year. Its free to get in but pay for rides.||January 8, 2012
Relenaj||50||Great place to walk around, rent a bike, have picnic or lunch. Also good choice for kids and animal lovers. Clean and relaxing. Would like to spend a whole month there.||January 7, 2012
JayPortsmouth||50||Winter wonderland was just magical, we have never visited before and we went during the day but had to return in the evening to get the full affect of the beautiful lights. A lovely family day out.||January 5, 2012
Nicki T||50||Most excellent fun for young to old. Very expensive when you add up your days spending. Lovely stalls, tasty food options and fun rides.||January 5, 2012
Cak2009||40||I live next to this park, and really enjoy a brisk walk through, or a short morning jog on the weekends. We have gotten into the habit of bringing treats for the squirrels - they particularly are fond of peanuts.||January 5, 2012
gail m||40||My Daughter and I went on a horse back ride in the park with the guides at Hyde Park Stables. It was so fun and they took very good care of us. Riding in the pard was a fun way to see the park and a little bit of London near the park. We loved the horses and the guides, Nicole was one of our guides, and we would do this again if we make it back to London. It was nice to have some horse time in the rush of our Vacation.||January 4, 2012
Atif K||40||The array of stalls and things to buy and eat was huge. Although, some of the rides were a bit on the expensive side for the amount of time spent in them.The weather was bad and it was raining which didn't help matters but the atmosphere was still great. Definitely worth a visit as no entrance fee and its up to you if you want to attend any of the attractions e.g the circus which you pay for but besides that you can roam around and enjoy||January 4, 2012
crapsguy||50||Hyde park is huge. They have lots of paths to walk in this beautiful park. One thing you notice in London is they have a lot of parks and they are all well maintained. We visited in December and the Winter Wonderland was set up in the southeast past of the park. It seemed more like a german Christmas than British though beased on the food, drink and things they were selling! It was packed so it is a popular attraction. There were notices on the metro to avoid the closes tube stop becuase it was so crowded over the weekend before Christmas. Anyway, Hyde park is a great stop for visitors.||January 3, 2012
Tea-Cee||50||Hyde Park is so fantastic if you love walking, cycling or riding a horse, even if you love roller blading. There's plenty of distractions along the way, and lost to see, with cafes too. We always make a point of walking through Hyde Park when we're in London. It just wouldn't be the same without a visit here. If you love the outdoors and you haven't been here before, just go!||January 2, 2012
Michelli2011||40||There was a Christmas Market when I was in town (that runs until Jan 3rd, 2012) so I went. I was not afraid to cut through the park at night because there were so many people there buying food, drinks, and gifts. Try the chimney cake! It tastes a little like pretzel but it is very amusing to watch them make it.||January 2, 2012
John S||50||We went to the fair in park had great time, muld wine yummy pork kebab and Weiss wurst beer and rides that giggle and terrify good afternoon fun. ||January 2, 2012
Kay D||50||We visited Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland which was an excellent spectacular. I would highly recommend this.||January 1, 2012
Cheryl S||40||www.hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/Our group consisted of 3 adults and 5 young children so purchased 2 family tickets online, in advance. (Highly recommended or you will pay more and spend longer queing). Booking attractions in advance also reduces confusion and indecision on the day over what to to/where to go. We visited on the evening of 29/12/11. The venue looked great at night with all the lights etc and great atmosphere. Snow would have been magical... However, we arrived in the middle of a rainstorm :(Entrance is free, great if you just want to wander round and pay-as-you go. We had booked the 'wheel' an alternative to the 'London Eye' (a downgrade though, reflected in the price) and Zippos Circus Extreme. The 'Wheel' didn't have a scheduled time so arriving at 5pm gave enough time to queue for that, after which we purchased hot dogs and hot chocolate! This saved the day as it was extremely cold & we got caught in a terrible rain storm whilst queuing. Then made our way to the Circus which started at 7pm. You are advised to arrive 20 mins prior to start time in order to get good seating. The kids loved both events. We padded out some time before and after by purchasing 'Tokens' for fair ground rides. But be warned...this venue is extremely costly if you don't plan and budget well in advance! I'd been warned about a parent who'd spent £40 in 20 minutes - easily done when a regular portion of chips for one costs £4.00. Take snacks/drinks for kids... then limit the treats! If budget isn't an issue then there's an abundance of choice from stalls to bars & restaurant type facilities.PROS: "If you're looking for great Christmas Market and traditional fayre then this is the place for you. There's also a skating rink (can't comment as didn't visit it), plenty of places to eat and music and entertainment in abundance. Something for everyone, adults & children alike"CONS: "Book events in advance. Pre-booking will reduce or may avoid queuing altogether. But don't over-book as you may run out of time. Wear warm clothes and protection from the elements = rain!. (if you book the 'Wheel' and it's torrential downpour, you won't see a thing). Budget well and stick to it if with children. Choose where you by refreshments carefully - if you hunt around you will find 1 or 2 reasonable stalls but most are costly. Be prepared for a crowded and busy venue."||December 30, 2011
Rosamunda_ar||50||I was there on a cold evening. Nobody was there except a couple of friends an us. And the gooses, and other animals. Loved it. When you´re in the middle of it, near the "The Serpentine" lake, you don´t even hear the city´s sounds. Loved it, went there a couple of times.||December 30, 2011
DawnEve96||50||We went ice skating and also to Zippos Circus. The ice skating was great and our four year old loved the Circus. Very very expensive to go on the rides though - at least £3.00 per person and you have to buy tokens as the ride owners don't take cash. We didn't pay anything less than £4.00 for a coffee and thought the prices were too steep. This is a captive audience so why not charge a reasonable amount and people may spend more.||December 30, 2011
Annie K||50||A very big place to walk, cycle, roller skate, do jogging in the heart of London. A big lake to look at with gulls and geese. Big trees and fresh cold air :) During Xmas holiday there is 'The Winter Wonderland' for young and old to play at, have a warm beverage, do ice skating, walk around have a bite and maybe buy a souvenir.||December 28, 2011

has2bperfect||50||Hyde Park is a welcome, and large, green space in the heart of London, make sure to walk past the Serpentine. If going from Notting Hill down to Knightsbridge then try walking through the park instead of taking a taxi, the tube or bus... you will enjoy the many sights.||December 26, 2011
Hoplisa||40||amazing kids loved very christmasy ..... we went in a group of 11 people so when we arrived we brought loads of tokens to see us though unaware that we were unable to use up our tokens the following day on are return or to get a refund at end of the night . it does say in small print but not good enough really, so be careful. ||December 26, 2011

Travellover6128||50||Hyde Park is one of those places where there is always something going on ! It covers 350 acres in central London and hosts such events as concerts, triathlons, festivals etc. The easiest tube stations to access it from are Hyde Park Corner, Marble Arch, Lancaster Gate and Knightsbridge, so it is extremely accessible. It’s probably most famous for The Serpentine Lake and Speakers Corner. The lake is a lovely place to spend time in both winter and summer and there is always an activity going on there. Speakers Corner is very famous and it is always interesting to see what topic is being talked about on a given day.I still think the best way to enjoy the park is just strolling through wondering down the paths and in the summer, taking a picnic and having a lazy afternoon watching the world go by. For a cheap and relaxing day in London, a walk through Hyde Park is perfect.||December 19, 2011
HawkeyeGirl24||40||We visited Hyde Park during Winter Wonderland. Overall we had a really good time, however I'd recommend visiting this attraction in the morning, as by noon it was packed to the point people couldn't really move and there was a long wait to even get in, and in the evening, it was even worse (there was an hour wait just to get in).||December 19, 2011
Sharpe26||20||I took my Goddaughter who is 18 to the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland on Friday 16th December. Firstly prior to our visit I tried to check out the details on their website, but each time I tried the site froze and I was not able to proceed. I tried on two different computers so I don't think it was my end.Arriving at Knightsbridge tube station there was a map which showed us how to get to Hyde Park but there was nothing indicating that the Winter Wonderland was taking place, nor how to get to it. We set out with optimism and it took us about 10 minutes of walking, mainly around an area of the park that was under construction. If it had not been for the big wheel we would never have spotted where the event was.Upon arrival we stopped for something to eat, the chorros with hot chocolate were delicious but messy. A good start but after that the event disappointed. It is mainly a very tacky fairground, with rides costing between £4 and £6 per person. The circus which we might have visited was only performing in the late afternoon / evening and as we were morning guests we missed this opportunity. The ice rink looked good, well run and not too crowded. We stood and watched for 10 minutes or so and everybody appeared to be enjoying themselves. After this we walked through to the Christmas Market and again were very disappointed, A heavy concentration of food stalls and silly hat stalls, very little else on offer, some jewellery, candles, crafts but in the minority.We had planned to spend the day here, at least 4-5 hours, in the end we stayed a little over an hour.It might have been better after dark when you couldn't see the tacky side so much.Although it is free entry, you will be expected to part with a lot of money after that.||December 19, 2011

ScrabbleAustralia||50||Ride a horse; chase a ball; walk a dog; in autumn shuffle through the fall leaves or just ramble. Try out the cafe by the Serpentine and let us know if it's worth visiting.||December 16, 2011
iantesstom||20||What a total and utter rip off, £6 per ride per adult and £4 per ride per child, so a family of 4 will pay £20 per ride. The food and beverage prices were also astronomical and in no shape way or form was this the Christmas wonderland as advertised, more like Wondering what has happened to the contents of my Wallet, Boris Johnson you should be ashamed of yourself for not having the city council properly regulate this so called fun fair, shame on you.||December 16, 2011

Alexander T||10||Trees tortured into regiments, spaced outrageously far apart so that it feels like a denuded wasteland. Tragic that this is what is forced to count as 'nature' in the city. I've heard people describe London as being 'incredibly green because of the trees' and 'the most treed city in Europe' and then they site THIS place as evidence for that opinions?!?I find that very, very sad. The fact that could even be true is the most sad part of all.||December 15, 2011

Stuart D||10||A nice concept but the event was dangerously over-crowded when we visited on a Saturday afternoon. The toilet facilities were hopelessly inadequate (ladies were even using using the gents' facilties because the queues for their toilets were even longer than those for the gentlemen).A similar but smaller event on the Southbank between Westminster Bridge and the Royal Albert Hall was more comfortable.||December 11, 2011
AnnapolisMatt||40||Hyde Park was a decent sized park and great if you were looking to go for a run or just lay about. While, there weren't a ton of chairs (and I think you had to pay to use them) it was still a welcomed break from the hustle and bustle of London. Also, I don't know what I would have done with out it as there aren't very many open spaces in London to go running. It saved me from putting on the pounds while we were there.||December 8, 2011

Stacey M||40||Hyde Park is transformed at Christmas into a magical place, with rides, food, christmas stands, shops and ice skating. It is a wonderful place to get into the Christmas spirit and enjoy the atmosphere. It is very crowded on the weekends, but the lines are not too long. The rides are rather expensive, but overall, it is a fun place to go, especially with kids, for an afternoon.||December 4, 2011
Shrnbaker1||50||We visited on a Friday evening and Saturday day. The Friday was definitely quieter and most rides had little or no queue. The rides cost £3 or £4 per person, so could be pricey if you have a large family. You need to buy tokens for most rides, 1 token = £1, if there's a queue to buy tokens look for another sale booth, there are lots of them dotted around. The Saturday was absolutely packed, but the Christmas Market was great. Lots of very unusual gifts available, and not over-priced in our opinion. There was a great choice of food available, along with lots of bars. The toilets were very clean. We left Winter Wonderland feeling very Christmasy (if that's a word!).||December 4, 2011

True W||40||I highly suggest a walk through Hyde Park. It is a much needed reprieve amongst the hustle and bustle of the city. It is unlike anything most of us encounter (unless you live/travel in NYC). Great rose gardens, beautiful pond, great stop for a coffee.||December 1, 2011
joesilcock2011||50||Went here twice whilst in London and it really is a brilliant place to pay a visit to. I just loved walking and taking in the nice atmosphere and sitting on a bench by the river watching the ducks. Oh and I had delicious fish and chips in a cafe just by the river. The christmas fair was on, I didn't actually take part in any of the stalls or rides but it was nice to walk through and see all the action!||November 29, 2011

mc47||40||Our young son had waited ages to visit. The Market was really pretty, and the rides were well laid out, but the prices were a total con. He is 6 years old and all rides that age had to have a parent ride with them. Each 1-2 minute ride cost £6 - 8 for 2 people. All grown up rides were busy, but it may explain why childrens rides were very quiet. The children's rides were all very tame, and did not really need a parent to accompany them, so why rip families off. There were lots of parents saying the same. It was a great visit, but would have been more magical if the pricing had been fair.||November 28, 2011
JosieJo42||30||Spent 5 hours in total going around the Winter Wonderland. Great selection of rides, though a little on the expensive side. Slightly disappointed with the Market - been to better at Birmingham. Spent a nice 50 mins in a heated tent watching Zippos Cricus. The children seem to love it but again slightly underwhelmed by it all. If you get claustrophobic in crowds steer clear. Nice experience but don't think I'd necessarily do it again.||November 27, 2011
YunziesTravels||40||Hordes of crowds pushing in every direction like a summer festival held in a maze, prices so high you would need to remortgage Hyde Park to buy a hot dog and a lay out so confusing it would defy chaos theory. In fact at one point I was convinced I would never leave, being forced to walk for all eternity in the hellish tourist trap with my only rations being the single roast chestnut that my life's earnings to date could buy. My only thought was: Help! Luckily I was with a hardy crowd who pulled me through this traumatic and frightening experience and gradually coaxed back my power of speech in a nearby pub. This being so, the Power Tower offers an altitudinous thrill at a relatively modest £6, while the helter skelter and ice rink are well worth a punt. My advice: take the kids, avoid the expensive food and drink on pain of death and bring sharpened elbows. Liam Gallagher was there when I visited and seemed to adopting this philosophy. But remember to get out...while you still can.||November 26, 2011
David A||50||One of the biggest and nicest parks we've been to. It is perfect for a picnic in mid-day, and you can see almost everybody doing that."Whole Foods Market" is located about 5 minutes on foot from its south-west entrance, and it is just the perfect beginning for a perfect picnic.As of all London's parks... This one is highly recommended!||November 25, 2011

sydneyalicat||40||Walked through here from Oxford street to the Natural history museum and it was lovely to get off the traffic filled streets. Watch out for the bikes though, there is a barclays bike station just inside the park so you can hire a bike and off you go.Dont forget some bread to feed the ducks on the Serpentine, very demanding they are. Few kiosks dotted around with food and drink and signs with maps in case you get lost, as we did.Lovely spot.||November 21, 2011
Eddybotil||40||On a crisp autumnal afternoon the park was a delight to stroll around. It's not as big as it looks on the map yet you can stroll until dusk visiting all the tucked away landmarks and watch folk exercising their horses (even the Horse Guards on some week days), or walking their dogs. On Saturdays the south side fills up with many groups of tiny children taking organsied lessons in football coaching. People watching all around the lakes and the Diana water feature especially is fun and it's not far to head to Knightsbridge, Oxford Street, Kensington or Queesnway depending on which corner you end up in. Sundays is always fun with Speakers corner and the arts and crafts stalls that line Bayswater Road. Best of all it's all free. A fine alternative to the empty pockets you soon acquire when visiting other attractions around the city. We always try to take in a park if the rains stay away when visiting London. It's like a breath of fresh air. Which is exactly what it is.||November 21, 2011

Rambus||50||This park is my favorite park in London. Perhaps because it was first large park with a lot of open space I met in London. It's not so big as Regent's Park, but it seems less empty, there is everything that shall be in park, and you can also look at usual life of locals - people come here to play some sport games, to rest or just to walk through. You can watch for landing planes from almost any part of the park, and there is a lot to see. You also can continue your walking by any of famous trading street or visit any cafe nearby.||November 5, 2011
DebashisM||50||One of the 6 Royal Parks/ Gardens, it is probably the most famous.Wonderful flora and fauna. On a sunny day, you can spend the whole day there... but sadly I'd had much to cover in the few days, so...||November 4, 2011

lesliebH1209TM||50||We stopped in at Hyde Park a couple of times on our recent trip. One day we strolled through, visited some of the statuary, the swans on the Serpentine, and the wonderful Princess Diana Memorial Playground. Another day, we went rowing on the Serpentine. Just a beautiful, easy place to hang out and relax in between busy sight-seeing. And, I believe the cleanest public restrooms I've ever encountered in a park or other recreational setting. Always a plus.||October 20, 2011
Fiver75||40||Hyde Park consists of beautifully maintained lawns and lovely green trees. Wide pathways cross the path and allow for a very comfortable stroll through the grounds. The Park has many little highlights, like the rose gardens and the Albert Memorial. Expect to see crowds at all times of the day – the park is very popular and very busy. A very nice park deserving of its famous status.||October 10, 2011
adamsaintlouis||40||Hyde Park is very large and has many beautiful places to walk around. The Diana Memorial Garden is here, as well as Speakers Corner.Many buses stop here (including all of the hop on hop off buses) so it is easy to get to. If in the area, take a stroll around and enjoy a great London park!||October 1, 2011
keith_malta27||40||If you go to Hyde Park you could hire a bike and cycle down the serpentine. After 5pm it gets quite busy but it is well worth a visit following an afternoon in Oxford Street or Knightsbridge.||September 24, 2011
mzzyap||50||Lots of buses pass all around it.The Marble Arch subway is closest to Speakers Corner. And remember, the Speakers Corner area only comes alive on Sundays, It's easy to spot the crowds. We usually shop ourselves out along Oxford Street, then takeaway food and head towards the park. Just great to flop on your own patch of grass, munch leisurely, and people-watch. Strolling around Hyde Park takes a while.||September 22, 2011
MumbaiHss||50||A great attraction to see in central london, you can get town at marble arch station or queensway station. This is one of the biggest park in central london. I was there for the Royal wedding which was shown on the big screen and a music concert||September 20, 2011
HelderBCarvalho||50||We loved Hydepark! its big, it calm and its beautiful! We went there and we walked almost till Kensigton Palace, wich is very far but the park is so beautiful that you forget you've been walking for miles! It has lots of squirrels and people on the grass resting or reading. It's really amazing. The only difficult thing was to fin the Princess Diana Memorial, its not very well indicated and the Memorial isn't very beautiful, at least we were expecting to see something more like Princess Diana.||September 12, 2011
79cameron79||50||it was Quite nice doing the pedal boats it was fun to ride it was a nice day out. there also is the princess diana memorial playground and fountain. plus a merry go round that went Quite fast. so its a nice thing to do with kids.||August 25, 2011
Brannigans||40||If you want to feel like you are away from it all even though you are still in the middle of things unwind in the park. You could lose yourself for hours in here strolling along the serpentine, squirrel spotting, having an impromptu coffee or ice cream, enjoying a picnic or a run or even having a swim. Bliss.||August 24, 2011
havetofly||50||I really loved the Sunday we spent here. We hired bicyles and cycled around the park, we watched people roller blading, we took a boat out on the Serpentine and managed to lose our oars and some gentleman returned them to us! we hopped out of the boat on the other side to visit Lady Diana's memorial, we went around to hear the speakers at speakers corner and generally had a wonderful day!||August 24, 2011
TeamTravel3||20||We were really looking forward to our first visit to Hyde Park which we spent on the last Sunday in July. We've visited Central Park in New York City and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco so spending the day in another great city park sounded like fun. Unfortunately we found trash strewn from where we entered at Speaker's Corner all the way to The Serpentine and the trash cans filled (we actually wondered if it was normal for people to leave their picnic trash in a pile on the lawn and the trash guy would come pick it up?). When we tried to sit somewhere besides on the ground with the trash, we were asked to pay 1.50 by an attendant or move along. When we did sit on the grass we were attacked by ants, so we decided to walk around The Serpentine Lake instead.When we arrived at The Serpentine we could see the water was dirty with things floating in it and signs placed round the perimeter that advised the water was contaminated with blue green algea. They clearly warned that contact with the water could cause diarrhea, skin rash, intestinal problems, vomiting, cramps, etc. So we skipped Serpentine Lake and walked around the lake to the Diana Fountain. On the way I stopped to take a picture of a small pond and waterfall, then realized the water had trash and plastic bottles floating in it. It would have been a very nice picture.The Diana Fountain was a highlight, but it was filled with adults and children so actually seeing the fountain and surrounding area was difficult. This is probably normal for July, but I expected a Memorial with a few kids splashing, not a giant wading pool so filled to capacity with adults and kids that the fountain itself was obscured. I imagine it is beautiful in the winter.The park does look like it has great sports facilities for a variety of sports (including horses), skills and ages which I'm sure London residents really enjoy. We did take a baseball so the boys played catch on the lawn for awhile so that was fun, as was getting ice cream from the ice cream truck, but in the end, we were glad to leave and don't plan on going back.||August 14, 2011
HamidJalal||40||While visiting Hyde Park especially when alone, you may ensure that you do not talk to strangers.. The incident with me goes like this... I was taking pictures of a monument in Hyde Park Corner when a funny looking man spotted me and introduced himself as a visitor from Italy. He asked me to take a picture of him with his camera and selected a relatively isolated place for background image. I took his picture, then he came to me asking something on a map. During this, two more men (probably foreigners) came from nowhere (from behind the trees I mean). One took out a police badge on his wallet and waived it on me and asked for my belongings (We all know Police in UK has a uniform and is quite courteous). He took my wallet and smelled it and searched thoroughly (luckily I did not have much foreign exchange.. at the most 50 GB Pounds). Then he directly asked me if I had US dollars etc. I told him I had none and they let me go. I am sure that had I kept more, they would have ripped me of it... It is all so spontaneous that you are left with little or no time to react.||August 4, 2011
Wisewoman0910||30||This is like a funfair and a market all in one. Although entrance is free, the attractions are not. We bought our circus, wheel and skating tickets online. The circus was interesting and the wheel gave great views over the park. Although we had booked out slot for skating, there was still quite a wait and the rink was very very crowded. The food and drinks are very expensive and there are few bargains among the market stalls although many of them were interesting and sold beautiful things. On the whole it is worth a visit perhaps just to wander around and browse.||July 30, 2011
IELIE||50||Good place in the center of London where to relax with friends or just do some running. Park is large enough with quite beautiful landscape. In summer it must be good place where to sit down on the grass and take a rest.||July 19, 2011
SomersetLover||40||Great to see the Serpentine at No 8 in Tripadvisor's Top Ten Wild Swimming places. My grandfather invented swimming in the Serpentine. He saw how people used to swim in German lakes and decided it would be good for Londoners too. He took years to persuade the Greater London Council to agree but when it was finally official, he made my father and his friend Peter Scott, the naturalist, swim every morning - just to show that 'people' wanted to!If you can't get to London, why not build your own natural swimming pond (try Gartenart.co.uk).

BeantownBriggs||50||We were in London for an extended period, my wife and our two young kids aged 3 and 4. We went to Hyde Park several times and the kids loved it...lots of room to run and play, a few bathrooms here and there (all nicely hidden by shrubbery), and in the center of it all is the Serpentine lake. Apparently you can swim in it - we did not (but our 4 yr old took a dip in Round Pond quite by accident - quite amusing!) - but the paddle boats are a great way to spend an hour on the water. There is also a very large Ferris wheel that is great fun, unless like me you have a HUGE fear of heights! Speakers Corner is in one, um, corner of the park and good to check out. And I went running around the park once in the late afternoon- was a fantastic ~4-5 miles that you can shorten or stretch by the route you pick. If you're a careful planner, you can pick out the drinking fountains too. So overall, you really should spend some time meandering around the park, if you have kids, bring them...or go for a run. Truly, it is one of the great city parks of the world!||June 16, 2011

HMadan||40||If you are looking to get away from the hustle bustle of London and yet be close to the heart of the city, spend some time in Hyde Park. Great for picnics, family time or some plain relaxation.||May 4, 2011
Pelf Nyok C||30||I walked through Hyde Park from Paddington to get to the other side because it was obviously a shorter route compared to walking around it. I had only expected to see lots of grassey area and wooden benches in the park but to my pleasant surprise, it was more than that!Hyde Park/Kensingtong Gardens was a huge park located somewhat on the west of central London. There were tracks for cycling, jogging, roller-blading; a lake in the middle named "The Serpentine"; and a Serpentine Gallery, among others.There was also lots of grassey areas, perfect for family picnics and chilling out under a tree with a book :D||May 3, 2011
DavidBasilious||30||Its a park! What more can i say. It has green grass , trees and a lake with some walkway paths over the lakes. Its a nice place to sit and relax , but hey its a park!||May 2, 2011
RiodeJaneiroFlavia||50||Select one day for it! Walk around, see the maps, see nature. doesn´t matter the time of the year! Enjoy it!!||February 14, 2011
ThatDaviesLady||40||I have to say, this year's Winter Wonderland is the best yet in my opinion. Yes, I agree it can be a little pricey but this is no standard funfair attraction. With beer halls and oopah bands for the adults and Santa and the elves for the kids, it really works for all ages. The rides are excellent and different from your standard waltzer/carousel affair (although both are there too) and the whole place is full of Christmas cheer. I've taken my kids twice and although they went on a couple of the rides, they mainly enjoyed the whole festive scene and they got to see Santa too (for free). The highlights for me was the fabulous Talking Tree (hilarious and also free) the Christmas Market is also very good and sells quality gifts rather than the usual tat some Christmas Market's tend to knock out, the hat stall was especially welcome on the day I went, as it was snowing. The second time was to go to Zippo's circus which I though. Although the show is shorter than the standard performances (50mins) it was festively themed, funny and very well done. For around £6 a ticket you can't complain. Plus it was warm, dry and my kids (8 and 5) absolutely loved it, especially the death-defying acrobats.I hope Winter Wonderland is a regular London winter fixture, it's great!||January 2, 2011
localhero25||40||If you are in London, definitely visit the Hyde Park in central London. In summer you can relax there, have a walk, have an ice-cream and chill out while in winter, in December, you can visit the Christmas market and buy little presents for family and friends (souvenirs) or have something hot to drink....||December 15, 2010
Jojo88_10||10||After viewing the winter wonderland website page and speaking to a number of other people who had visited we decided to take a trip here on sunday 12th december. We pre booked tickets for the circus at 5.00pm and arrived at around 2.00pm. It was absolutely rammed with people, thousands! We certainly expected a lot of people but not to this extent. You could not move or walk faster than the pace of a snail and you could not stop to look at any stalls because you just had to keep moving with the crowd or you were literally pushed by the people behind. One woman was collapsed unconcious on the floor and the crowd just literally stepped over her and carried on. There were probably 10 different stalls just repeated over and over again around the park and the prices were fairly expensive. As I said before, we did glance over at them as we shuffled past but could not stop.We spent 20 minutes walking a matter of metres to the toilets and then we had to queue for one hour just to get in!In the end we flogged our circus tickets for a reduced price because we could not stand the thought of waiting for the circus here and we left.It was then hell trying to get on the Hyde Park Corner underground due to the crowds and it took us another hour and a lot of pushing to eventually get on it to leave.Please take my advice and give this one a miss, we were really looking forward to it and it turned out to be the worst day out we have ever had and so stressful!||December 13, 2010
Horleyflyer||20||We ventured out to Hyde Park despite the ' rather you than me's ' we got on mentioning it. The place was rammed. So much so in places that we had to hang on to each other to keep from getting separated. It is free to go in and there are plenty of stalls to peruse but everything was very expensive. You buy tokens for the rides which were a pound each.Most rides are 3 or more tokens each person. We let the kids choose their favourite ride and for four of us to go on it came to £19 . The second ride was the dodgems at £5 a car . Wait times for rides were fairly short but hardly surprising at those prices. As we are on a faily tight budget we called it a day after that only pausing for a hot drink ( £3.50 for a hot chocolate ! Even at London prices this was alot. ) I had looked online at the prices for the big wheel , circus and skating before we went and found those expensive so didn't bother. As I read it , for the circus ,you buy tickets for a 50 min show and select your show time but still have to be early as it is first come first served.I think 6 of us would have been £55 and the waiting around would have taken a big chunk out of the afternoon.I loved seeing the kids laughing at the talking tree which is near the big wheel and there is a good atmosphere but not sure how they can justify the high prices.||December 10, 2010

TACOB0B||50||Beautiful park where you can spend hours walking along enjoying the outdoors. Be sure to bring some peanuts with you so you can feed the squirrels. They will actually come up to you and take them out of your hand. It was incredible.||October 24, 2010
Selloy||40||I’ve been in Hyde Park (July 2010) and almost all the grass was dead, or at least it wasn’t green :( I don’t know what happened but what could be a marvelous view was a little bit disappointing. Nevertheless it’s a great space. I pass by the speaker’s corner, the serpentine, people running, playing football or fighting and a race against the cancer was going on. It’s an important spot that should not be missed even though being a quick visit.||July 28, 2010
ReshmaBudhia||50||Hyde Park is especially for travelers who either do not have parks in their home towns or have not really experienced "parks" like you read in novels..... its huge, lush and green, lively and so relaxing..... Even a one hour walking around makes you so fresh and ready to face the hustle-bustle of London...... the place has some lovely eat-outs, a lake, loads of kids playing around and options for activities.The best time would be dusk or dawn!||June 29, 2010
Tara146||50||I LOVED Hyde Park! It's beautiful, and one of the nicest parks I have been to in my life. Be sure to check out the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain!||May 30, 2010
CarboriusJames||40||We arrived in London on Christmas afternoon and our hotel was right nearby. Everything else was closed so we decided to take a walk in the afternoon in Hyde Park, all the way to the Albert Memorial. The park was nice, very reminiscent of its New York counterpart, Central Park. But by the time we reached the Albert Memorial, the sun was setting (around 4 pm) and we started heading back the other direction towards our hotel. By the time we reached one of the north gates, it was LOCKED! We searched for another exit and it too was LOCKED! We didn't have a choice but climb over the tall fencing. Felt like we were breaking out of a prison. Definitely an interesting visit to Hyde Park on Christmas afternoon.Moral of the story: get out of the park before it closes (check the closing times), or you'll be trapped inside like we were.||June 15, 2009
Tallula-18||50||Were in London for a week in May with my 2 yr old and 8 month old. We had good weather and walked everywhere with my children in a stroller. Hyde Park was great for them. The flowers were magnificent and the kids loved seeing the squirrels and ducks and horses etc. There are restaurants to sit at. Def recommended for children.||May 5, 2009
Bjorkus||40||We were there in October and the fall colors were beautiful. Kensington Palace is at one end, and the Wellington Arch is at the other. We walked from one end to the other, which was quite pleasant. There's a lake with lots of swans and geese. Plenty of trails for walking, running, or biking. The Albert Memorial near the middle of the park is lovely.If you're nearby and have some time to spare or want to get a little exercise, I recommend checking Hyde Park out.||November 26, 2008
Firemedic245||50||After spending our first full day in London sightseeing (walking from Oxford street, over to picadilly, on the tube to the London Eye, over the bridge to Big Ben and Westminster Abbey, back to Harrods, then over to Hyde Park for a break.) We found a Bench along the water and sat for an hour or so. Beautiful place to relax and let the mind unwind. If you like to people watch there is plenty of that to do as well. Also if you enjoy birds there are plenty of them too. I also found the riding trail inside the park very neat, people riding there horses in the middle of London. If you get up early enough you can see the Queens mounted Police taking there horses for a ride. A much needed break in the middle of London.||September 29, 2008
lisad88||50||Although this is a very large park, it is well worth a stroll through. We, my sister, my brother & myself, just returned from an April trip to London. This park, as well as all the others, is exquisitely landscaped. There are several different paths you can take, I suggest the walk along the Serpentine. At the brigde that crosses it you can see the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain with the Lido Restaurant beside it on the bank. After that head west toward Kensington, the birds around the Round Pond are regal. Lots of room for all kinds of activities or just take a bench & relax!!!||May 2, 2008
perthgal||50||After a always busy oxford street, it is lovely to sit back and relax in Hyde Park. There are deck chairs avaliable for rent and lots of grass to relax. After a day of shopping, I sat on the grass and read my book. Its really amazing having such a huge park in the middle of London!||July 10, 2006
BoardingPass19905||50||Last summer (2004), I spent at least one day a week lying around in Hyde Park with my girlfirend, just talking and watching the day go by. I have never had such a good time in my life. You might assume that it is just a big park and that there is not much to do. However this is so wrong: There is so much to do. We walked around the park for hours, and it was just nice to be somewhere where people will give you your own space and you can just be with someone you love. I know that sounds really cheesy but it is true. I recommend it for young couples who just want to be together but don't necessarilly have that much money. It is also a change to the other carp that you have to do over and over again, for example the cinema. Hope thisreview helps.||March 5, 2005
Resort22018||50||Hyde Park was especially beautiful in early April of this year. I went for a lovely walk through the Park on my way from Buckingham Palace to Oxford Street. The tulips were in bloom, the grass was lush and green, and the views of the surrounding areas were lovely! By the way, a walk through Hyde Park makes a pleasant diversion from shopping in Selfridges or other nearby Oxford Street shops.St. James's Park and Green Park were also simply fantastic!||April 20, 2004
